    <h1>A Bitter Price</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>27:30-40</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. Hebrews 12:17.</p>
      <p>No sooner had Jacob left his father’s tent than Esau entered. Though he had sold his birthright, and conﬁrmed
          the transfer by a solemn oath, he was now determined to secure its blessings, regardless of his brother’s
          claim. With the spiritual was connected the temporal birthright, which would give him the headship of the
          family and possession of a double portion of his father’s wealth. These were blessings that he could
          value....</p>
      <p>Esau had lightly valued the blessing while it seemed within his reach, but he desired to possess it now that it
          was gone from him forever. All the strength of his impulsive, passionate nature was aroused, and his grief and
          rage were terrible. He cried with an exceeding bitter cry, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” ...</p>
      <p>The birthright which he had so carelessly bartered he could not now regain. “For one morsel of meat,” for a
          momentary gratiﬁcation of appetite that had never been restrained, Esau sold his inheritance; but when he saw
          his folly, it was too late to recover the blessing....</p>
      <p>Esau was not shut out from the privilege of seeking God’s favor by repentance, but he could ﬁnd no means of
          recovering the birthright. His grief did not spring from conviction of sin; he did not desire to be reconciled
          to God. He sorrowed because of the results of his sin, but not for the sin itself.</p>
      <p>Repentance includes sorrow for sin, and a turning away from it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its
          sinfulness; until we turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change in the life.</p>
      <p>There are many who fail to understand the true nature of repentance. Multitudes sorrow that they have sinned,
          and even make an outward reformation, because they fear that their wrongdoing will bring suffering upon
          themselves. But this is not repentance in the Bible sense. They lament the suffering, rather than the sin.
          Such was the grief of Esau when he saw that the birthright was lost to him forever.</p>
