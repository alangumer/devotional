    <h1>He Made Things Right</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>19:1-10</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10.</p>
      <p>“The chief among the publicans,” Zacchaeus, was a Jew, and detested by his countrymen. His rank and wealth were
          the reward of a calling they abhorred, and which was regarded as another name for injustice and extortion. Yet
          the wealthy customs ofﬁcer was not altogether the hardened man of the world that he seemed. Beneath the
          appearance of worldliness and pride was a heart susceptible to divine inﬂuences.</p>
      <p>Zacchaeus had heard of Jesus.... In this chief of the publicans was awakened a</p>
      <p>longing for a better life.... He felt that he was a sinner in the sight of God. Yet what</p>
      <p>he had heard of Jesus kindled hope in his heart. Repentance, reformation of life, was possible, even to him....
          Zacchaeus began at once to follow the conviction that</p>
      <p>had taken hold upon him, and to make restitution to those whom he had wronged. Already he had begun thus to
          retrace his steps, when the news sounded through Jericho that Jesus was entering the town. Zacchaeus
          determined to see Him.... In the presence of the multitude, “Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the</p>
      <p>Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by false
          accusation, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house.”</p>
      <p>There are those who have had very meager opportunities, who have walked in ways of error because they knew no
          better way, to whom beams of light will come. As the word of Christ came to Zacchaeus, “Today I must abide at
          thy house,” so the word will come to them; and those who were supposed to be hardened sinners will be found to
          have hearts as tender as a child’s because Christ has deigned to notice them. Many will come from the grossest
          error and sin, and will take the place of others who have had opportunities and privileges but have not prized
          them. They will be accounted the chosen of God, elect, precious; and when Christ shall come into His kingdom,
          they will stand next His throne.</p>
