      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>2:8-15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. Genesis
          2:15.</p>
      <p>Although everything God had made was in the perfection of beauty, and there seemed nothing wanting upon the
          earth which God had created to make Adam and Eve happy, yet He manifested His great love to them by planting a
          garden especially for them. A portion of their time was to be occupied in the happy employment of dressing the
          garden, and a portion in receiving the visits of angels, listening to their instruction, and in happy
          meditation. Their labor was not wearisome but pleasant and invigorating. This beautiful garden was to be their
          home.</p>
      <p>In this garden the Lord placed trees of every variety for usefulness and beauty. There were trees laden with
          luxuriant fruit, of rich fragrance, beautiful to the eye, and pleasant to the taste, designed of God to be
          food for the holy pair. There were the lovely vines which grew upright, laden with their burden of fruit,
          unlike anything man has seen since the fall. The fruit was very large and of different colors; some nearly
          black, some purple, red, pink, and light green. This beautiful and luxuriant growth of fruit upon the branches
          of the vine was called grapes. They did not trail upon the ground, although not supported by trellises, but
          the weight of the fruit bowed them down. It was the happy labor of Adam and Eve to form beautiful bowers from
          the branches of the vine and train them, forming dwellings of nature’s beautiful, living trees and foliage,
          laden with fragrant fruit.</p>
      <p>It was the design of God that man should ﬁnd happiness in the employment of tending the things He had created,
          and that his wants should be met with the fruits of the trees of the garden....</p>
      <p>Had happiness consisted in doing nothing, man, in his state of holy innocence, would have been left unemployed.
          But He who created man knew what would be for his happiness; and no sooner had He created him than He gave him
          his appointed work. The promise of future glory, and the decree that man must toil for his daily bread, came
          from the same throne.</p>
