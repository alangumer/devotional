    <h1>Greatness in Humiliation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord,
          because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me. Micah 7:8,
          9.</strong></p>
      <p>Conscience was uttering bitter and humiliating truths to David. While his faithful subjects wondered at his
          sudden reverse of fortune, it was no mystery to the king. He had often had forebodings of an hour like this.
          He had wondered that God had so long borne with his sins, and had delayed the merited retribution. And now in
          his hurried and sorrowful ﬂight, his feet bare, his royal robes changed for sackcloth, the lamentations of his
          followers awaking the echoes of the hills, he thought of his loved <nobr>capital—of</nobr> the place which had
          been the scene of his <nobr>sin—and</nobr> as he remembered the goodness and <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> of
          God, he was not altogether without hope....</p>
      <p>Many a wrongdoer has excused his own sin by pointing to David’s fall, but how few there are who manifest
          David’s penitence and humility. How few would bear reproof and retribution with the patience and fortitude
          that he manifested. He had confessed his sin, and for years had sought to do his duty as a faithful servant of
          God; he had labored for the upbuilding of his kingdom, and under his rule it had attained to strength and
          prosperity never reached before. He had gathered rich stores of material for the building of the house of God,
          and now was all the labor of his life to be swept away? Must the results of years of consecrated toil, the
          work of genius and devotion and statesmanship, pass into the hands of his reckless and traitorous son, who
          regarded not the honor of God nor the prosperity of Israel? How natural it would have seemed for David to
          murmur against God in this great afﬂiction!</p>
      <p>But he saw in his own sin the cause of his trouble.... And the Lord did not</p>
      <p>forsake David. This chapter in his experience, when, under cruelest wrong and insult, he shows himself to be
          humble, unselﬁsh, generous, and submissive, is one of the noblest in his whole experience. Never was the ruler
          of Israel more truly great in the sight of heaven than at this hour of his deepest outward humiliation.</p>
