    <h1>Born Again</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>3:1-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
          John 3:21.</p>
      <p>Nicodemus had come to the Lord thinking to enter into a discussion with Him, but Jesus laid bare the foundation
          principles of truth. He said to Nicodemus, It is not theoretical knowledge you need so much as spiritual
          regeneration. You need not to have your curiosity satisﬁed, but to have a new heart....</p>
      <p>He [Nicodemus] saw that the most rigid obedience to the mere letter of the law as applied to the outward life
          could entitle no man to enter the kingdom of heaven. In the estimation of men, his life had been just and
          honorable; but in the presence of Christ he felt that his heart was unclean, and his life unholy.... As
          the</p>
      <p>Saviour explained to him concerning the new birth, he longed to have this change wrought in himself.... Jesus
          answered the unspoken question: “As Moses lifted</p>
      <p>up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him
          should not perish, but have eternal life.” ...</p>
      <p>Nicodemus received the lesson, and carried it with him. He searched the Scriptures in a new way, not for the
          discussion of a theory, but in order to receive life for the soul. He began to see the kingdom of heaven as he
          submitted himself to the leading of the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>For a time Nicodemus did not publicly acknowledge Christ, but he watched His life, and pondered His teachings.
          In the Sanhedrin council he repeatedly thwarted the schemes of the priests to destroy Him....</p>
      <p>After the Lord’s ascension, when the disciples were scattered by persecution, Nicodemus came boldly to the
          front. He employed his wealth in sustaining the infant church that the Jews had expected to be blotted out at
          the death of Christ. In the time of peril he who had been so cautious and questioning was ﬁrm as a rock,
          encouraging the faith of the disciples, and furnishing means to carry forward the work of the gospel. He was
          scorned and persecuted by those who had paid him reverence in other days. He became poor in this world’s
          goods; yet he faltered not in the faith which had its beginning in that night conference with Jesus.</p>
