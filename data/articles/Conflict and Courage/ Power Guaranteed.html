      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>32:24-30</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>As a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. Genesis 32:28.</p>
      <p>Had not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining the birthright by fraud, God could not have heard his
          prayer and mercifully preserved his life. So in the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed sins
          to appear before them while tortured with fear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off
          their faith, and they could not have conﬁdence to plead with God for deliverance. But while they have a deep
          sense of their unworthiness, they will have no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins will have been blotted
          out by the atoning blood of Christ, and they cannot bring them to remembrance....</p>
      <p>All who endeavor to excuse or conceal their sins, and permit them to remain upon the books of heaven,
          unconfessed and unforgiven, will be overcome by Satan. The more exalted their profession, and the more
          honorable the position which they hold, the more grievous is their course in the sight of God, and the more
          certain the triumph of the great adversary.</p>
      <p>Yet Jacob’s history is an assurance that God will not cast off those who have been betrayed into sin, but who
          have returned unto Him with true repentance. It was by <nobr>self-surrender</nobr> and conﬁding faith that
          Jacob gained what he had failed to gain by conﬂict in his own strength. God thus taught His servant that
          divine power and grace alone could give him the blessing he craved. Thus it will be with those who live in the
          last days. As dangers surround them, and despair seizes upon the soul, they must depend solely upon the merits
          of the atonement.... None will ever</p>
      <p>perish while they do this....</p>
      <p>Jacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined.... It is now that</p>
      <p>we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith. The greatest victories to the church of
          Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by talent or education, by wealth or the
          favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience chamber with God, when earnest,
          agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power.</p>
