    <h1>No One Sorry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel 22</strong></p>
      <p>All of you have conspired against me ... and there is none of you that is sorry for me. 1 Samuel 22:8.</p>
      <p>The spirit of evil was upon Saul. He felt that his doom had been sealed by the solemn message of his rejection
          from the throne of Israel. His departure from the plain requirements of God was bringing its sure results. He
          did not turn, and repent, and humble his heart before God, but opened it to receive every suggestion of the
          enemy. He listened to every false witness, eagerly receiving anything that was detrimental to the character of
          David, hoping that he might ﬁnd an excuse for manifesting his increasing envy and hatred of him who had been
          anointed to the throne of Israel.</p>
      <p>Every rumor was credited, no matter how inconsistent and irreconcilable it was with the former character and
          custom of David.</p>
      <p>Every evidence that the protecting care of God was over David seemed to imbitter and deepen his one engrossing
          and determined purpose. The failure to accomplish his own designs appeared in marked contrast to the success
          of the fugitive in eluding his search, but it only made the determination of the king the more unrelenting and
          ﬁrm. He was not careful to conceal his designs toward David, nor scrupulous as to what means should be
          employed in accomplishing his purpose.</p>
      <p>It was not the man David, who had done him no harm, against whom the king was contending. He was in controversy
          with the King of heaven; for when Satan is permitted to control the mind that will not be ruled by Jehovah, he
          will lead it according to his will, until the man who is thus in his power becomes an efﬁcient agent to carry
          out his designs. So bitter is the enmity of the great originator of sin against the purposes of God, so
          terrible is his power for evil, that when men disconnect from God, Satan inﬂuences them, and their minds are
          brought more and more into subjection, until they cast off the fear of God, and the respect of men, and become
          bold and avowed enemies of God and of His people.... God</p>
      <p>hates all sin, and when man persistently refuses all the counsel of heaven, he is left to the deceptions of the
          enemy.</p>
