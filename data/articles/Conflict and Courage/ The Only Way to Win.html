    <h1>The Only Way to Win</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Joshua <nobr>1:1-9</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that
          thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy way
          prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Joshua 1:8.</p>
      <p>If men will walk in the path that God has marked out for them, they will have a counselor whose wisdom is far
          above any human wisdom. Joshua was a wise general because God was his guide. The ﬁrst sword that Joshua used
          was the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God....</p>
      <p>It was because the strongest inﬂuences were to be brought to bear against his principles of righteousness that
          the Lord in mercy charged him not to turn to the right hand or to the left. He was to follow a course of
          strictest integrity.... If there</p>
      <p>had been no peril before Joshua, God would not over and over again have charged him to be of good courage. But
          amid all his cares, Joshua had his God to guide Him.</p>
      <p>There is no greater deception than for man to suppose that in any difﬁculty he can ﬁnd a better guide than God,
          a wiser counselor in any emergency, a stronger defense under any circumstance....</p>
      <p>The Lord has a great work to be done in our world. To every man He has given His work for man to do. But man is
          not to make man his guide, lest he be led astray; this is always unsafe. While Bible religion embodies the
          principles of activity in service, at the same time there is the necessity of asking for wisdom daily from the
          Source of all wisdom. What was Joshua’s victory? Thou shalt meditate upon the Word of God day and night. The
          word of the Lord came to Joshua just before he passed over Jordan.... This was the secret of Joshua’s
          victory.</p>
      <p>He made God his Guide.</p>
      <p>Those holding the positions of counselors should be unselﬁsh men, men of faith, men of prayer, men that will
          not dare to rely upon their own human wisdom, but will seek earnestly for light and intelligence as to what is
          the best manner of conducting their business. Joshua, the commander of Israel, searched the books diligently
          in which Moses had faithfully chronicled the directions given by <nobr>God,—His</nobr> requirements, reproofs,
          and <nobr>restrictions,—lest</nobr> he should move unadvisedly.</p>
