    <h1>No Compromise</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Daniel <nobr>1:17-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Them that honour me, I will honour. 1 Samuel 2:30.</p>
      <p>In the experience of Daniel and his companions we have an instance of the triumph of principle over temptation
          to indulge the appetite. It shows us that through religious principle young men may triumph over the lusts of
          the ﬂesh, and remain true to God’s requirements, even though it costs them a great sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>What if Daniel and his companions had made a compromise with those heathen ofﬁcers, and had yielded to the
          pressure of the occasion, by eating and drinking as was customary with the Babylonians? That single instance
          of departure from principle would have weakened their sense of right and their abhorrence of wrong. Indulgence
          of appetite would have invoked the sacriﬁce of physical vigor, clearness of intellect, and spiritual power.
          One wrong step would probably have led to others, until, their connection with Heaven being severed, they
          would have been swept away by temptation....</p>
      <p>While Daniel clung to his God with unwavering trust, the spirit of prophetic power came upon him. While he was
          instructed of man in the duties of court life, he was taught of God to read the mysteries of future ages, and
          to present to coming generations, through ﬁgures and similitudes, the wonderful things that would come to pass
          in the last days.</p>
      <p>God designed that man should be constantly improving, daily reaching a higher point in the scale of excellence.
          He will help us, if we seek to help ourselves. Our hope of happiness in two worlds depends upon our
          improvement in one. At every point we should be guarded against the ﬁrst approach to intemperance.</p>
      <p>Dear youth, God calls upon you to do a work which through His grace you can do.... Show a purity of tastes,
          appetite, and habits that bears comparison with</p>
      <p>Daniel’s. God will reward you with calm nerves, a clear brain, an unimpaired judgment, keen perceptions. The
          youth of today whose principles are ﬁrm and unwavering, will be blessed with health of body, mind, and
          soul.</p>
