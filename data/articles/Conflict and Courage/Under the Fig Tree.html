    <h1>Under the Fig Tree</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>1:45-51</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming, he said, “Here is an Israelite worthy of the name: there is nothing false in
          him.” John 1:47, N.E.B.</p>
      <p>Nathanael heard John as he pointed to the Saviour and said, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
          of the world” (John 1:29)! Nathanael looked at Jesus, but he was disappointed in the appearance of the world’s
          Redeemer. Could He who bore the marks of toil and poverty be the Messiah? Jesus was a worker; He had toiled
          with humble workingmen, and Nathanael went away. But he did not form his opinion decidedly as to what the
          character of Jesus was. He knelt down under a ﬁg tree, inquiring of God if indeed this man was the Messiah.
          While he was there, Philip came and said, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did
          write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” But the word “Nazareth” again aroused his unbelief, and he said,
          “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” He was full of prejudice, but Philip did not seek to combat
          his prejudice; he simply said, “Come and see.” ...</p>
      <p>Would it not be well for us to go under the ﬁg tree to plead with God as to what is truth? Would not the eye of
          God be upon us as it was upon Nathanael? Nathanael believed on the Lord, and exclaimed, “Rabbi, thou art the
          Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.”</p>
      <p>His unbelief was swept away, and faith, ﬁrm, strong, and abiding, took possession of his soul. Jesus commended
          the trusting faith of Nathanael.</p>
      <p>There are many in the same condition as was Nathanael. They are prejudiced and unbelieving because they have
          never come in contact with the special truths for these last days or with the people who hold them, and it
          will require but attendance upon a meeting full of the Spirit of Christ to sweep away their unbelief. No
          matter what we have to meet, what opposition, what effort to turn souls away from the truth of heavenly
          origin, we must give publicity to our faith, that honest souls may see and hear and be convinced for
          themselves. Our work is to say, as did Philip: “Come and see.” We hold no doctrine that we wish to hide.</p>
