    <h1>One Expensive Mistake</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. Ecclesiastes 7:29.</strong></p>
      <p>The book of Genesis gives quite a deﬁnite account of social and individual life, and yet we have no record of
          an infant’s being born blind, deaf, crippled, deformed, or imbecile. There is not an instance upon record of a
          natural death in infancy, childhood, or early manhood. There is no account of men and women dying of disease.
          Obituary notices in the book of Genesis run thus: “And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and
          thirty years: and he died.” “And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.”
          ...</p>
      <p>God endowed man with so great vital force that he has withstood the accumulation of disease brought upon the
          race in consequence of perverted habits, and has continued for six thousand years. This fact of itself is
          enough to evidence to us the strength and electrical energy that God gave to man at his creation....</p>
      <p>If Adam, at his creation, had not been endowed with twenty times as much vital force as men now have, the race,
          with their present habits of living in violation of natural law, would have become extinct....</p>
      <p>God did not create the race in its present feeble condition. This state of things is not the work of
          Providence, but the work of man; it has been brought about by wrong habits and abuses, by violating the laws
          that God has made to govern man’s existence.</p>
      <p>God created man for His own glory, that after test and trial the human family might become one with the
          heavenly family. It was God’s purpose to <nobr>re-populate</nobr> heaven with the human family, if they would
          show themselves obedient to His every word.</p>
      <p>To Eve it seemed a small thing to disobey God by tasting the fruit of the forbidden tree, and to tempt her
          husband also to transgress; but their sin opened the ﬂoodgates of woe upon the world. Who can know, in the
          moment of temptation, the terrible consequences that will result from one wrong step?</p>
