    <h1>Peter Speaks Up</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>16:13-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son
          of the living God. Matthew 16:15, 16.</p>
      <p>From the ﬁrst, Peter had believed Jesus to be the Messiah. Many others who had been convicted by the preaching
          of John the Baptist, and had accepted Christ, began to doubt as to John’s mission when he was imprisoned and
          put to death; and they now doubted that Jesus was the Messiah, for whom they had looked so long.... But Peter
          and his companions turned not from their allegiance. The</p>
      <p>vacillating course of those who praised yesterday and condemned today did not destroy the faith of the true
          follower of the Saviour....</p>
      <p>Peter had expressed the faith of the twelve. Yet the disciples were still far from understanding Christ’s
          mission. The opposition and misrepresentation of the priests and rulers, while it could not turn them away
          from Christ, still caused them great perplexity.... From time to time precious rays of light from Jesus
          shone</p>
      <p>upon them, yet often they were like men groping among shadows. But on this day, before they were brought face
          to face with the great trial of their faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon them in power. For a little time
          their eyes were turned away from “the things which are seen,” to behold “the things which are not seen” (2
          Corinthians 4:18). Beneath the guise of humanity they discerned the glory of the Son of God....</p>
      <p>The truth which Peter had confessed is the foundation of the believer’s faith. It is that which Christ Himself
          has declared to be eternal life. But the possession of this knowledge was no ground for
          <nobr>self-gloriﬁcation.</nobr> Through no wisdom or goodness of his own had it been revealed to Peter. Never
          can humanity, of itself, attain to a knowledge of the divine. “It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?
          deeper than hell; what canst thou know?” (Job 11:8). Only the spirit of adoption can reveal to us the deep
          things of God, which “eye hath not seen, not ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man.” “God hath
          revealed them unto us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God” (1
          Corinthians 2:9, 10).</p>
