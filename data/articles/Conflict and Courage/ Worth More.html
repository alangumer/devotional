      <p><strong>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto
          the recompence of the reward. Hebrews 11:26.</strong></p>
      <p>Moses had been a student. He was well educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, but this was not the only
          qualiﬁcation which he needed to prepare him for his work. He was, in the providence of God, to learn patience,
          to temper his passions. In a school of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and hardships he was to receive an education
          which would be of the utmost importance to him. These trials would prepare him to exercise a fatherly care
          over all who needed his help. No knowledge, no study, no eloquence, could be a substitute for this experience
          in trials to one who was to watch for souls as they that must give an account. In doing the work of a humble
          shepherd, in being forgetful of self and interested for the ﬂock given to his charge, he was to become ﬁtted
          for the most exalted work ever entrusted to mortals, that of being a shepherd of the sheep of the Lord’s
          pasture.</p>
      <p>Those who fear God in the world must be connected with Him. Christ is the most perfect educator the world ever
          knew. To receive wisdom and knowledge from Him was more valuable to Moses than all the learning of the
          Egyptians....</p>
      <p>The faith of Moses led him to look at the things which are unseen, which are eternal. He left the splendid
          attractions of court life because sin was there. He gave up present and seeming good that ﬂattered only to
          ruin and destroy. The real attractions, the eternal, were of value to him. The sacriﬁces made by Moses were
          really no sacriﬁces. With him it was letting go a present, apparent, ﬂattering good for sure, high, immortal
          good.</p>
      <p>Moses endured the reproach of Christ, considering reproach greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. He
          believed what God had said and was not inﬂuenced to swerve from his integrity by any of the world’s
          reproaches. He walked the earth as God’s free man.... He looked to the things unseen and faltered</p>
      <p>not. The recompense of reward was attractive to him, and it may be also to us. He was familiar with God.</p>
