    <h1>Mighty Weakling</h1>

      <p><strong>Judges 15</strong></p>
      <p>He shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. Judges 13:5.</p>
      <p>God’s promise that through Samson He would “begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines” was
          fulﬁlled; but how dark and terrible the record of that life which might have been a praise to God and a glory
          to the nation! Had Samson been true to his divine calling, the purpose of God could have been accomplished in
          his honor and exaltation. But he yielded to temptation and proved untrue to his trust, and his mission was
          fulﬁlled in defeat, bondage, and death.</p>
      <p>Physically, Samson was the strongest man upon the earth; but in <nobr>self-control,</nobr> integrity, and
          ﬁrmness, he was one of the weakest of men. Many mistake strong passions for a strong character, but the truth
          is that he who is mastered by his passions is a weak man. The real greatness of the man is measured by the
          power of the feelings that he controls, not by those that control him.</p>
      <p>God’s providential care had been over Samson, that he might be prepared to accomplish the work which he was
          called to do. At the very outset of life he was surrounded with favorable conditions for physical strength,
          intellectual vigor, and moral purity. But under the inﬂuence of wicked associates he let go that hold upon God
          which is man’s only safeguard, and he was swept away by the tide of evil. Those who in the way of duty are
          brought into trial may be sure that God will preserve them; but if men willfully place themselves under the
          power of temptation, they will fall, sooner or later.</p>
      <p>The very ones whom God purposes to use as His instruments for a special work, Satan employs his utmost power to
          lead astray. He attacks us at our weak points, working through defects in the character to gain control of the
          whole man; and he knows that if these defects are cherished, he will succeed. But none need be overcome. Man
          is not left alone to conquer the power of evil by his own feeble efforts. Help is at hand and will be given to
          every soul who really desires it.</p>
