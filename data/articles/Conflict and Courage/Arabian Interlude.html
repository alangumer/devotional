    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Galatians <nobr>1:11-18</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned
          again unto Damascus. Galatians 1:17.</p>
      <p>Paul’s life was in peril, and he received a commission from God to leave Damascus for a time. He went into
          Arabia; and there, in comparative solitude, he had ample opportunity for communion with God and for
          contemplation. He wished to be alone with God, to search his own heart, to deepen his repentance, and to
          prepare himself by prayer and study to engage in a work which appeared to him too great and too important for
          him to undertake. He was an apostle, not chosen of men, but chosen of God, and his work was plainly stated to
          be among the Gentiles.</p>
      <p>While in Arabia he did not communicate with the apostles; he sought God earnestly with all his heart,
          determining not to rest till he knew for a certainty that his repentance was accepted and his great sin
          pardoned. He would not give up the conﬂict until he had the assurance that Jesus would be with him in his
          coming ministry. He was ever to carry about with him in the body the marks of Christ’s glory, in his eyes,
          which had been blinded by the heavenly light, and he desired also to bear with him constantly the assurance of
          Christ’s sustaining grace. Paul came into close connection with Heaven, and Jesus communed with him, and
          established him in his faith bestowing upon him His wisdom and grace.</p>
      <p>All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for communion with their own hearts, with nature, and
          with God.... They need to have a personal</p>
      <p>experience in obtaining a knowledge of the will of God. We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart.
          When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more
          distinct the voice of God.... Amidst the hurrying throng, and the strain of life’s intense</p>
      <p>activities, he who is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will receive
          a new endowment of both physical and mental strength. His life will breathe out a fragrance, and will reveal a
          divine power that will reach men’s hearts.</p>
