    <h1>What Do They See?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>20:1-19</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they
          seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. Isaiah 39:4.</p>
      <p>The visit of the ambassadors to Hezekiah was a test of his gratitude and devotion.... Had Hezekiah improved the
          opportunity given him to bear witness</p>
      <p>to the power, the goodness, the compassion, of the God of Israel, the report of the ambassadors would have been
          as light piercing darkness. But he magniﬁed himself above the Lord of hosts. He “rendered not again according
          to the beneﬁt done unto him; for his heart was lifted up.” ...</p>
      <p>The story of Hezekiah’s failure to prove true to his trust ... is fraught with an important lesson for all. Far
          more than we do, we need to speak of the precious chapters in our experience, of the mercy and
          <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> of God, of the matchless depths of the Saviour’s love. When mind and heart are
          ﬁlled with the love of God, it will not be difﬁcult to impart that which enters into the spiritual life. Great
          thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, unselﬁsh purposes, yearnings for piety and holiness,
          will ﬁnd expression in words that reveal the character of the heart treasure.</p>
      <p>Those with whom we associate day by day need our help, our guidance. They may be in such a condition of mind
          that a word spoken in season will be as a nail in a sure place. Tomorrow some of these souls may be where we
          can never reach them again. What is our inﬂuence over these fellow travelers?</p>
      <p>What have your friends and acquaintances seen in your house? Are you, instead of revealing the treasures of the
          grace of Christ, displaying those things that will perish with the using? Or do you, to those with whom you
          are brought in contact, communicate some new thought of Christ’s character and work? ... O that those for whom
          God has done marvelous things would show forth His praises, and tell of His mighty works. But how often those
          for whom God works are like <nobr>Hezekiah—forgetful</nobr> of the Giver of all their blessings.</p>
