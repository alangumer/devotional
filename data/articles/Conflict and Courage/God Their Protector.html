      <p><strong>Ezra 7; Ezra 8</strong></p>
      <p>For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the
          way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him;
          but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. Ezra 8:22.</p>
      <p>Ezra’s faith that God would do a mighty work for His people, led him to tell Artaxerxes of his desire to return
          to Jerusalem to revive an interest in the study of God’s word and to assist his brethren in restoring the holy
          city. As Ezra declared his perfect trust in the God of Israel as one abundantly able to protect and care for
          His people, the king was deeply impressed.... He made him a special</p>
      <p>representative of the <nobr>Medo-Persian</nobr> kingdom, and conferred on him extensive powers for the carrying
          out of the purposes that were in his heart....</p>
      <p>Thus again the children of the dispersion were given opportunity to return to the land with the possession of
          which were linked the promises to the house of Israel....</p>
      <p>Before them was a journey that would occupy several months. The men were taking with them their wives and
          children, and their substance, besides large treasure for the temple and its service. Ezra was aware that
          enemies lay in wait by the way, ready to plunder and destroy him and his company; yet he had asked from the
          king no armed force for protection....</p>
      <p>In this matter, Ezra and his companions saw an opportunity to magnify the name of God before the heathen. Faith
          in the power of the living God would be strengthened if the Israelites themselves should now reveal implicit
          faith in their divine Leader. They therefore determined to put their trust wholly in Him. They would ask for
          no guard of soldiers. They would give the heathen no occasion to ascribe to the strength of man the glory that
          belongs to God alone. They could not afford to arouse in the minds of their heathen friends one doubt as to
          the sincerity of their dependence on God as His people.... Only by keeping the law of the Lord</p>
      <p>before them, and striving to obey it, would they be protected.... “So we fasted and</p>
      <p>besought our God for this: and He was entreated of us.”</p>
