    <h1>Not God’s Way</h1>

      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>2:11-15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. Acts 7:22.</p>
      <p>Moses supposed that his education in the wisdom of Egypt had fully qualiﬁed him to lead Israel from bondage.
          Was he not learned in all the things necessary for a general of armies? Had he not had the greatest advantages
          of the best schools in the <nobr>land?—Yes:</nobr> he felt that he was able to deliver them. He ﬁrst set about
          his work by trying to gain the favor of his own people by redressing their wrongs. He killed an Egyptian who
          was imposing upon one of his brethren. In this he manifested the spirit of him who was a murderer from the
          beginning, and proved himself unﬁt to represent the God of mercy, love, and tenderness. He made a miserable
          failure of his ﬁrst attempt. Like many another, he then immediately lost his conﬁdence in God, and turned his
          back upon his appointed work; he ﬂed from the wrath of Pharaoh. He concluded that because of his mistake ...
          God would not permit him to have any part in the work of delivering His people from their cruel bondage. But
          the Lord permitted these things that He might be able to teach him the gentleness, goodness,
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> which it is necessary for every laborer for the Master to possess....</p>
      <p>In the very height of his human glory the Lord permitted Moses to reveal the foolishness of man’s wisdom, the
          weakness of human strength, that he might be led to understand his utter helplessness, and his inefﬁciency
          without being upheld by the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>In slaying the Egyptian, Moses had fallen into the same error so often committed by his fathers, of taking into
          their own hands the work that God has promised to do. It was not God’s will to deliver His people by warfare,
          as Moses thought, but by His own mighty power, that the glory might be ascribed to Him alone. Yet even this
          rash act was overruled by God to accomplish His purposes. Moses was not prepared for his great work. He had
          yet to learn the same lesson of faith that Abraham and Jacob had been <nobr>taught—not</nobr> to rely upon
          human strength or wisdom, but upon the power of God for the fulﬁllment of His promises.</p>
