      <p><strong>2 Chronicles <nobr>20:1-30</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us;
          neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. 2 Chronicles 20:12.</p>
      <p>Toward the close of Jehoshaphat’s reign the kingdom of Judah was invaded by an army before whose approach the
          inhabitants of the land had reason to tremble.... Jehoshaphat was a man of courage and valor. For years he had
          been</p>
      <p>strengthening his armies and his fortiﬁed cities. He was well prepared to meet almost any foe; yet in this
          crisis he put not his trust in the arm of ﬂesh. Not by disciplined armies and fenced cities, but by a living
          faith in the God of Israel, could he hope to gain the victory over these heathen who boasted of their power to
          humble Judah in the eyes of the nations.</p>
      <p>“Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. And Judah
          gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
          the Lord.” Standing in the temple court before his people, Jehoshaphat poured out his soul in prayer, pleading
          God’s promises, with confession of Israel’s helplessness....</p>
      <p>With conﬁdence Jehoshaphat could say to the Lord, “Our eyes are upon Thee.” For years he had taught the people
          to trust in the One who in past ages had so often interposed to save His chosen ones from utter destruction;
          and now, when the kingdom was in peril, Jehoshaphat did not stand alone; “all Judah stood before the Lord,
          with their little ones, their wives, and their children.” Unitedly they fasted and prayed; unitedly they
          besought the Lord to put their enemies to confusion, that the name of Jehovah might be gloriﬁed....</p>
      <p>God was the strength of Judah in this crisis, and He is the strength of His people today. We are not to trust
          in princes, or to set men in the place of God. We are to remember that human beings are fallible and erring,
          and that He who has all power is our strong tower of defense. In every emergency we are to feel that the
          battle is His. His resources are limitless, and apparent impossibilities will make the victory all the
          greater.</p>
