    <h1>A Better Country</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their
          God: for he hath prepared for them a city. Hebrews 11:16.</strong></p>
      <p>When Lot entered Sodom he fully intended to keep himself free from iniquity and to command his household after
          him. But he signally failed....</p>
      <p>Many are still making a similar mistake.... Their children are surrounded</p>
      <p>by temptation, and too often they form associations that are unfavorable to the development of piety and the
          formation of a right character. The atmosphere of lax morality, of unbelief, of indifference to religious
          things, has a tendency to counteract the inﬂuence of the parents. Examples of rebellion against parental and
          divine authority are ever before the youth; many form attachments for inﬁdels and unbelievers, and cast in
          their lot with the enemies of God.</p>
      <p>In choosing a home, God would have us consider, ﬁrst of all, the moral and religious inﬂuences that will
          surround us and our families. We may be placed in trying positions, for many cannot have their surroundings
          what they would; and whenever duty calls us, God will enable us to stand uncorrupted, if we watch and pray,
          trusting in the grace of Christ. But we should not needlessly expose ourselves to inﬂuences that are
          unfavorable to the formation of Christian character....</p>
      <p>Those who secure for their children worldly wealth and honor at the expense of their eternal interests, will
          ﬁnd in the end that these advantages are a terrible loss. Like Lot, many see their children ruined, and barely
          save their own souls. Their lifework is lost; their life is a sad failure. Had they exercised true wisdom,
          their children might have had less of worldly prosperity, but they would have made sure of a title to the
          immortal inheritance.</p>
      <p>The heritage that God has promised to His people is not in this world....</p>
      <p>We must dwell as pilgrims and strangers here if we would gain “a better country, that is, an heavenly.”</p>
