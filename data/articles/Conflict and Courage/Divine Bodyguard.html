      <p><strong>At my ﬁrst answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me....</strong></p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and
          that all the Gentiles might hear. 2 Timothy 4:16, 17.</p>
      <p>When Paul was summoned to appear before the emperor Nero for trial, it was with the near prospect of certain
          death.... Among the Christians at Rome, there</p>
      <p>was not one who came forward to stand by him in that trying hour.... Paul before</p>
      <p><nobr>Nero—how</nobr> striking the contrast! ... The name of Nero made the world tremble. To incur his
          displeasure was to lose property, liberty, life; and his frown was more to be dreaded than a pestilence.</p>
      <p>Without money, without friends, without counsel, the aged prisoner stood before <nobr>Nero—the</nobr>
          countenance of the emperor bearing the shameful record of the passions that raged within; the face of the
          accused telling of a heart at peace with God.</p>
      <p>How could Nero, a capricious, passionate, licentious tyrant, be expected to understand or appreciate the
          character and motives of this son of God? ...</p>
      <p>The results of opposite systems of education stood that day <nobr>contrasted—a</nobr> life of unbounded
          <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> and a life of entire <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> Here were the representatives of
          two theories of <nobr>life—all-absorbing</nobr> selﬁshness, which counts nothing too valuable to be sacriﬁced
          for momentary gratiﬁcation, and <nobr>self-denying</nobr> endurance, ready to give up life itself, if need be,
          for the good of others....</p>
      <p>The people and the judges looked at him in surprise. They had been present at many trials, and had looked upon
          many a criminal; but never had they seen a man wear a look of such holy calmness.... His words struck a chord
          that vibrated</p>
      <p>in the hearts even of the most hardened. Truth, clear and convincing, overthrew error.... The words spoken on
          this occasion were destined to shake nations....</p>
      <p>Faithful among the faithless, loyal among the disloyal, he stands as God’s representative, and his voice is as
          a voice from heaven.... His words are as a shout</p>
      <p>of victory above the roar of battle.</p>
