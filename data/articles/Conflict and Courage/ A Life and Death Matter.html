    <h1>A Life and Death Matter</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis 32</strong></p>
      <p>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
          Genesis 32:26.</p>
      <p>Jacob, in the great crisis of his life, turned aside to pray. He was ﬁlled with one overmastering
          <nobr>purpose—to</nobr> seek for transformation of character.</p>
      <p>It was in a lonely, mountainous region, the haunt of wild beasts and lurking place of robbers and murderers.
          Solitary and unprotected, Jacob bowed in deep distress upon the earth.... With earnest cries and tears he made
          his prayer before</p>
      <p>God. Suddenly a strong hand was laid upon him. He thought that an enemy was seeking his life, and he endeavored
          to wrest himself from the grasp of his assailant.</p>
      <p>In the darkness the two struggled for the mastery. Not a word was spoken, but Jacob put forth all his strength,
          and did not relax his efforts for a moment. While he was thus battling for his life, the sense of his guilt
          pressed upon his soul; his sins rose up before him, to shut him out from God. But in his terrible extremity he
          remembered God’s promises, and his whole heart went out in entreaty for His mercy. The struggle continued
          until near the break of day, when the stranger placed his ﬁnger upon Jacob’s thigh, and he was crippled
          instantly. The patriarch now discerned the character of his antagonist. He knew that he had been in conﬂict
          with a heavenly messenger, and this was why his almost superhuman effort had not gained the victory. It was
          Christ, “the Angel of the covenant,” who had revealed Himself to Jacob. The patriarch was now disabled and
          suffering the keenest pain, but he would not loosen his hold....</p>
      <p>He urged, “Let me go, for the day breaketh;” but Jacob answered, “I will not let thee go, except thou bless
          me.” Had this been a boastful, presumptuous conﬁdence, Jacob would have been instantly destroyed; but his was
          the assurance of one who confesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts the faithfulness of a
          <nobr>covenant-keeping</nobr> God.</p>
      <p>That for which Jacob had vainly wrestled in his own strength was won through <nobr>self-surrender</nobr> and
          steadfast faith.</p>
