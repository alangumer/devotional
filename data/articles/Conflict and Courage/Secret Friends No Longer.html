    <h1>Secret Friends No Longer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>19:38-42</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he
          might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
          And there came also Nicodemus, which at the ﬁrst came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and
          aloes, about an hundred pound weight. John 19:38, 39.</p>
      <p>Neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted the Saviour while He was living. They knew that such a step
          would exclude them from the Sanhedrin, and they hoped to protect Him by their inﬂuence in its councils. For a
          time they had seemed to succeed; but the wily priests, seeing their favor to Christ, had thwarted their plans.
          In their absence Jesus had been condemned and delivered to be cruciﬁed. Now that He was dead, they no longer
          concealed their attachment to Him. While the disciples feared to show themselves openly as His followers,
          Joseph and Nicodemus came boldly to their aid....</p>
      <p>Nicodemus, when he saw Jesus lifted up on the cross, remembered His words spoken by night in the Mount of
          Olives: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that
          whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life” (John 3:14, 15).</p>
      <p>On that Sabbath, when Christ lay in the grave, Nicodemus had opportunity for reﬂection. A clearer light now
          illuminated his mind, and the words which Jesus had spoken to him were no longer mysterious. He felt that he
          had lost much by not connecting himself with the Saviour during His life. Now he recalled the events of
          Calvary. The prayer of Christ for His murderers and His answer to the petition of the dying thief spoke to the
          heart of the learned councilor. Again he looked upon the Saviour in His agony; again he heard that last cry,
          “It is ﬁnished,” spoken like the words of a conqueror. Again he beheld the reeling earth, the darkened
          heavens, the rent veil, the shivered rocks, and his faith was forever established.</p>
      <p>The very event that destroyed the hopes of the disciples convinced Joseph and Nicodemus of the divinity of
          Jesus. Their fears were overcome by the courage of a ﬁrm and unwavering faith.</p>
