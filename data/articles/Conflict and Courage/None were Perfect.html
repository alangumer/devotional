      <p><strong>This priceless treasure we hold, so to speak, in a common earthenware <nobr>jar—to</nobr> show that the
          splendid power of it belongs to God and not to us. 2 Corinthians 4:7, Phillips.</strong></p>
      <p>All the disciples had serious faults when Jesus called them to His service. Even John, who came into closest
          association with the meek and lowly One, was not himself naturally meek and yielding. He and his brother were
          called “the sons of thunder.” While they were with Jesus, any slight shown to Him aroused their indignation
          and combativeness. Evil temper, revenge, the spirit of criticism, were all in the beloved disciple. He was
          proud, and ambitious to be ﬁrst in the kingdom of God. But day by day, in contrast with his own violent
          spirit, he beheld the tenderness and forbearance of Jesus, and heard His lessons of humility and patience. He
          opened his heart to the divine inﬂuence, and became not only a hearer but a doer of the Saviour’s words. Self
          was hid in Christ. He learned to wear the yoke of Christ and to bear His burden.</p>
      <p>Jesus reproved His disciples, He warned and cautioned them; but John and his brethren did not leave Him; they
          chose Jesus, notwithstanding the reproofs. The Saviour did not withdraw from them because of their weakness
          and errors. They continued to the end to share His trials and to learn the lessons of His life. By beholding
          Christ, they became transformed in character....</p>
      <p>As His representatives among men, Christ does not choose angels who have never fallen, but human beings, men of
          like passions with those they seek to save....</p>
      <p>Having been in peril themselves, they are acquainted with the dangers and difﬁculties of the way, and for this
          reason are called to reach out for others in like peril. There are souls perplexed with doubt, burdened with
          inﬁrmities, weak in faith, and unable to grasp the Unseen; but a friend whom they can see, coming to them in
          Christ’s stead, can be a connecting link to fasten their trembling faith upon Christ.</p>
      <p>We are to be laborers together with the heavenly angels in presenting Jesus to the world.</p>
