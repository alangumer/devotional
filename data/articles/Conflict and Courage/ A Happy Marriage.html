    <h1>A Happy Marriage</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis 24</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake
          unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before
          thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. Genesis 24:7.</p>
      <p>Isaac was highly honored by God in being made inheritor of the promises through which the world was to be
          blessed; yet when he was forty years of age he submitted to his father’s judgment in appointing his
          experienced, <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> servant to choose a wife for him. And the result of that marriage, as
          presented in the Scriptures, is a tender and beautiful picture of domestic happiness: “Isaac brought her into
          his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted
          after his mother’s death.”</p>
      <p>What a contrast between the course of Isaac and that pursued by the youth of our time, even among professed
          Christians! Young people too often feel that the bestowal of their affections is a matter in which self alone
          should be <nobr>consulted—a</nobr> matter that neither God nor their parents should in any wise control. Long
          before they have reached manhood or womanhood they think themselves competent to make their own choice,
          without the aid of their parents.... Many have thus wrecked</p>
      <p>their happiness in this life and their hope of the life to come....</p>
      <p>Parents should never lose sight of their own responsibility for the future happiness of their children. Isaac’s
          deference to his father’s judgment was the result of the training that had taught him to live a life of
          obedience. While Abraham required his children to respect parental authority, his daily life testiﬁed that the
          authority was not a selﬁsh or arbitrary control, but was founded in love, and had their welfare and happiness
          in view.</p>
      <p>If there is any subject which should be carefully considered and in which the counsel of older and more
          experienced persons should be sought, it is the subject of marriage; if ever the Bible was needed as a
          counselor, if ever divine guidance should be sought in prayer, it is before taking a step that binds persons
          together for life.</p>
