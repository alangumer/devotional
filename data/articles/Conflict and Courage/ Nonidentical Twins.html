      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>25:19-28</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the ﬁeld; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in
          tents. Genesis 25:27.</p>
      <p>Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac, present a striking contrast, both in character and in life.... Esau
          grew up loving <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation</nobr> and centering all his</p>
      <p>interest in the present. Impatient of restraint, he delighted in the wild freedom of the chase, and early chose
          the life of a hunter. Yet he was the father’s favorite. The quiet, <nobr>peace-loving</nobr> shepherd was
          attracted by the daring and vigor of this elder son, who fearlessly ranged over mountain and desert, returning
          home with game for his father and with exciting accounts of his adventurous life.</p>
      <p>Jacob, thoughtful, diligent, and <nobr>care-taking,</nobr> ever thinking more of the future than the present,
          was content to dwell at home, occupied in the care of the ﬂocks and the tillage of the soil. His patient
          perseverance, thrift, and foresight were valued by the mother. His affections were deep and strong, and his
          gentle, unremitting attentions added far more to her happiness than did the boisterous and occasional
          kindnesses of Esau....</p>
      <p>Jacob had learned from his mother of the divine intimation that the birthright should fall to him, and he was
          ﬁlled with an unspeakable desire for the privileges which it would confer. It was not the possession of his
          father’s wealth that he craved; the spiritual birthright was the object of his longing. To commune with God as
          did righteous Abraham, to offer the sacriﬁce of atonement for his family, to be the progenitor of the chosen
          people and of the promised Messiah, and to inherit the immortal possessions embraced in the blessings of the
          <nobr>covenant—here</nobr> were the privileges and honors that kindled his most ardent desires....</p>
      <p>But while he thus esteemed eternal above temporal blessings, Jacob had not an experimental knowledge of the God
          whom he revered. His heart had not been renewed by divine grace. He believed that the promise concerning
          himself could not be fulﬁlled so long as Esau retained the rights of the <nobr>ﬁrst-born,</nobr> and he
          constantly studied to devise some way whereby he might secure the blessing which his brother held so lightly,
          but which was so precious to himself.</p>
