    <h1>Two of a Kind</h1>

      <p><strong>Numbers 23</strong></p>
      <p>“Be on your guard against covetousness in any shape or form. For a man’s real life in no way depends upon the
          number of his possessions.” Luke 12:15, Phillips.</p>
      <p>The curse which Balaam had not been permitted to pronounce against God’s people, he ﬁnally succeeded in
          bringing upon them by seducing them into sin.</p>
      <p>Balaam witnessed the success of his diabolical scheme. He saw the curse of God visited upon His people, and
          thousands falling under His judgments; but the divine justice that punished sin in Israel did not permit the
          tempters to escape. In the war of Israel against the Midianites, Balaam was slain....</p>
      <p>The fate of Balaam was similar to that of Judas, and their characters bear a marked resemblance to each other.
          Both these men tried to unite the service of God and mammon, and met with signal failure. Balaam acknowledged
          the true God, and professed to serve Him; Judas believed in Jesus as the Messiah, and united with His
          followers. But Balaam hoped to make the service of Jehovah the steppingstone to the acquirement of riches and
          worldly honor; and failing in this he stumbled and fell and was broken. Judas expected by his connection with
          Christ to secure wealth and promotion in that worldly kingdom which, as he believed, the Messiah was about to
          set up. The failure of his hopes drove him to apostasy and ruin. Both Balaam and Judas had received great
          light and enjoyed special privileges, but a single cherished sin poisoned the entire character and caused
          their destruction....</p>
      <p>One cherished sin will, little by little, debase the character, bringing all its nobler powers into subjection
          to the evil desire. The removal of one safeguard from the conscience, the indulgence of one evil habit, one
          neglect of the high claims of duty, breaks down the defenses of the soul and opens the way for Satan to come
          in and lead us astray. The only safe course is to let our prayers go forth daily from a sincere heart, as did
          David, “Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not” (Psalm 17:5).</p>
