    <h1>The Song of Moses and the Lamb</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exodus 15</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God, and I will praise him; my
          father’s God, and I will exalt him. Exodus 15:2, R.V.</p>
      <p>From the most terrible peril one night had brought complete deliverance. That vast, helpless
          <nobr>throng—bondmen</nobr> unused to battle, women, children, and cattle, with the sea before them, and the
          mighty armies of Egypt pressing <nobr>behind—had</nobr> seen their path opened through the waters and their
          enemies overwhelmed in the moment of expected triumph. Jehovah alone had brought them deliverance, and to Him
          their hearts were turned in gratitude and faith. Their emotion found utterance in songs of praise. The Spirit
          of God rested upon Moses, and he led the people in a triumphant anthem of thanksgiving, the earliest and one
          of the most sublime that are known to man....</p>
      <p>That song does not belong to the Jewish people alone. It points forward to the destruction of all the foes of
          righteousness and the ﬁnal victory of the Israel of God. The prophet of Patmos beholds the
          <nobr>white-robed</nobr> multitude that have “gotten the victory,” standing on the “sea of glass mingled with
          ﬁre,” having “the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb”
          (Revelation 15:2, 3)....</p>
      <p>In freeing our souls from the bondage of sin, God has wrought for us a deliverance greater than that of the
          Hebrews at the Red Sea. Like the Hebrew host, we should praise the Lord with heart and soul and voice for His
          “wonderful works to the children of men.” Those who dwell upon God’s great mercies, and are not unmindful of
          His lesser gifts, will put on the girdle of gladness and make melody in their hearts to the Lord. The daily
          blessings that we receive from the hand of God, and above all else the death of Jesus to bring happiness and
          heaven within our reach, should be a theme for constant gratitude....</p>
      <p>All the inhabitants of heaven unite in praising God. Let us learn the song of the angels now, that we may sing
          it when we join their shining ranks.</p>
