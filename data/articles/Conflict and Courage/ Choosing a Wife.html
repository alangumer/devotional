    <h1>Choosing a Wife</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis 24</strong></p>
      <p>Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: but thou shalt
          go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. Genesis 24:3, 4.</p>
      <p>Abraham’s habitual faith in God and submission to His will were reﬂected in the character of Isaac; but the
          young man’s affections were strong, and he was gentle and yielding in disposition. If united with one who did
          not fear God, he would be in danger of sacriﬁcing principle for the sake of harmony. In the mind of Abraham,
          the choice of a wife for his son was a matter of grave importance; he was anxious to have him marry one who
          would not lead him from God....</p>
      <p>Abraham had marked the result of the intermarriage of those who feared God and those who feared Him not, from
          the days of Cain to his own time. The consequences of his own marriage with Hagar, and of the marriage
          connections of Ishmael and Lot, were before him. The lack of faith on the part of Abraham and Sarah had
          resulted in the birth of Ishmael, the mingling of the righteous seed with the ungodly. The father’s inﬂuence
          upon his son was counteracted by that of the mother’s idolatrous kindred and by Ishmael’s connection with
          heathen wives....</p>
      <p>The wife of Lot was a selﬁsh, irreligious woman, and her inﬂuence was exerted to separate her husband from
          Abraham. But for her, Lot would not have remained in Sodom, deprived of the counsel of the wise,
          <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> patriarch....</p>
      <p>No one who fears God can without danger connect himself with one who fears Him not. “Can two walk together,
          except they be agreed?” (Amos 3:3). The happiness and prosperity of the marriage relation depends upon the
          unity of the parties; but between the believer and the unbeliever there is a radical difference of tastes,
          inclinations, and purposes. They are serving two masters, between whom there can be no concord. However pure
          and correct one’s principles may be, the inﬂuence of an unbelieving companion will have a tendency to lead
          away from God.... The Lord’s direction is, “Be ye not unequally yoked together with</p>
      <p>unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 6:14, 17, 18).</p>
