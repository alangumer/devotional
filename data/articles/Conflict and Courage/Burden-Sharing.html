      <p><strong>Daniel <nobr>9:1-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting, and sackcloth, and
          ashes: and I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession. Daniel 9:3, 4.</p>
      <p>Burdened in behalf of Israel, Daniel studied anew the prophecies of Jeremiah. They were very
          <nobr>plain—so</nobr> plain that he understood by these testimonies recorded in books “the number of the
          years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in
          the desolations of Jerusalem.”</p>
      <p>With faith founded on the sure word of prophecy, Daniel pleaded with the Lord for the speedy fulﬁllment of
          these promises. He pleaded for the honor of God to be preserved. In his petition he identiﬁed himself fully
          with those who had fallen short of the divine purpose, confessing their sins as his own.</p>
      <p>What a prayer was that which came forth from the lips of Daniel! What humbling of soul it reveals! The warmth
          of heavenly ﬁre was recognized in the words that were going upward to God. Heaven responded to that prayer by
          sending its messenger to Daniel. In this our day, prayers offered in like manner will prevail with God. “The
          effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.” As in ancient times, when prayer was offered, ﬁre
          descended from heaven, and consumed the sacriﬁce upon the altar, so in answer to our prayers, the heavenly ﬁre
          will come into our souls. The light and power of the Holy Spirit will be ours....</p>
      <p>Have not we as great need to call upon God as had Daniel? I address those who believe that we are living in the
          very last period of this earth’s history. I entreat you to take upon your own souls a burden for our churches,
          our schools, and our institutions. That God who heard Daniel’s prayer will hear ours when we come to Him in
          contrition. Our necessities are as urgent, our difﬁculties are as great, and we need to have the same
          intensity of purpose, and in faith roll our burden upon the great <nobr>Burden-bearer.</nobr> There is need
          for hearts to be as deeply moved in our time as in the time when Daniel prayed.</p>
