    <h1>Martyred for Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts 6; Acts 7</strong></p>
      <p>And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
          Acts 6:15.</p>
      <p>Stephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man of deep piety and broad faith.... He was very active in
          the cause of Christ and boldly proclaimed</p>
      <p>his faith. Learned rabbis and doctors of the law engaged in public discussion with him, conﬁdently expecting an
          easy victory. But “they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.” ...</p>
      <p>As the priests and rulers saw the power that attended the preaching of Stephen, they were ﬁlled with bitter
          hatred.... [They] seized Stephen and brought him</p>
      <p>before the Sanhedrin council for trial....</p>
      <p>Saul of Tarsus was present and took a leading part against Stephen. He brought the weight of eloquence and the
          logic of the rabbis to bear upon the case, to convince the people that Stephen was preaching delusive and
          dangerous doctrines; but in Stephen he met one who had a full understanding of the purpose of God in the
          spreading of the gospel to other nations....</p>
      <p>In the cruel faces about him the prisoner read his fate; but he did not waver. For him the fear of death was
          gone. For him the enraged priests and the excited mob had no terror. The scene before him faded from his
          vision. To him the gates of heaven were ajar, and, looking in, he saw the glory of the courts of God, and
          Christ, as if just risen from His throne, standing ready to sustain His servant.</p>
      <p>In every age God’s chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted, yet through their afﬂiction the
          knowledge of God has been spread abroad.... When the</p>
      <p>noble and eloquent Stephen was stoned to death ... there was no loss to the cause of the gospel. The light of
          heaven that gloriﬁed his face, the divine compassion breathed in his dying prayer, were as a sharp arrow of
          conviction to the bigoted Sanhedrist who stood by, and Saul, the persecuting Pharisee, became a chosen vessel
          to bear the name of Christ before Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.</p>
