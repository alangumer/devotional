      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>3:14-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: or speak
          to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the ﬁshes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in
          all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? Job <nobr>12:7-9.</nobr></p>
      <p>Although the earth was blighted with the curse, nature was still to be man’s lesson book. It could not now
          represent goodness only; for evil was everywhere present, marring earth and sea and air with its deﬁling
          touch....</p>
      <p>In drooping ﬂower and falling leaf Adam and his companion witnessed the ﬁrst signs of decay. Vividly was
          brought to their minds the stern fact that every living thing must die. Even the air, upon which their life
          depended, bore the seeds of death.</p>
      <p>Continually they were reminded also of their lost dominion. Among the lower creatures Adam had stood as king,
          and so long as he remained loyal to God, all nature acknowledged his rule; but when he transgressed, this
          dominion was forfeited. The spirit of rebellion, to which he himself had given entrance, extended throughout
          the animal creation....</p>
      <p>But man was not abandoned to the results of the evil he had chosen. In the sentence pronounced upon Satan was
          given an intimation of redemption.... This</p>
      <p>sentence, spoken in the hearing of our ﬁrst parents, was to them a promise. Before they heard of the thorn and
          the thistle, of the toil and sorrow that must be their portion, or of the dust to which they must return, they
          listened to words that could not fail of giving them hope. All that had been lost by yielding to Satan could
          be regained through Christ.</p>
      <p>After the transgression of Adam, God might have destroyed every opening bud and blooming ﬂower, or He might
          have taken away their fragrance, so grateful to the senses. In the earth seared and marred by the curse, in
          the briers, the thistles, the thorns, the tares, we may read the law of condemnation; but in the delicate
          color and perfume of the ﬂowers, we may learn that God still loves us, that His mercy is not wholly withdrawn
          from the earth.</p>
