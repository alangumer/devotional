      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>25:18-35</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house;
          because my lord ﬁghteth the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days. 1 Samuel
          25:28.</p>
      <p>Abigail met David with respect, showing him honor and deference, and pleaded her case eloquently and
          successfully. While not excusing her husband’s insolence, she still pleaded for his life. She also revealed
          the fact that she was not only a discreet woman, but a godly woman, acquainted with the works and ways of God
          in David. She stated her ﬁrm faith in the fact that David was the anointed of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Abigail presented by implication the course that David ought to pursue. He should ﬁght the battles of the Lord.
          He was not to seek revenge for personal wrongs, even though persecuted as a traitor.... These words could have
          come only</p>
      <p>from the lips of one who had partaken of the wisdom from above. The piety of Abigail, like the fragrance of a
          ﬂower, breathed out all unconsciously in face and word and action. The Spirit of the Son of God was abiding in
          her soul. Her speech, seasoned with grace, and full of kindness and peace, shed a heavenly inﬂuence. Better
          impulses came to David, and he trembled as he thought what might have been the consequences of his rash
          purpose....</p>
      <p>A consecrated Christian life is ever shedding light and comfort and peace. It is characterized by purity, tact,
          simplicity, and usefulness. It is controlled by that unselﬁsh love that sanctiﬁes the inﬂuence. It is full of
          Christ, and leaves a track of light wherever its possessor may go.</p>
      <p>Abigail was a wise reprover and counselor. David’s passion died away under the power of her inﬂuence and
          reasoning....</p>
      <p>With a humble heart he received the rebuke.... He gave thanks and blessings</p>
      <p>because she advised him righteously. There are many who, when they are reproved, think it praiseworthy if they
          receive the rebuke without becoming impatient; but how few take reproof with gratitude of heart and bless
          those who seek to save them from pursuing an evil course.</p>
