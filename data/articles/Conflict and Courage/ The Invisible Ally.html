      <p><strong>Joshua <nobr>5:13-15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Joshua 1:5. Study carefully the experiences of
          Israel in their travels to Canaan.... We need</p>
      <p>to keep the heart and mind in training, by refreshing the memory with the lessons that the Lord taught His
          ancient people. Then to us, as He designed it should be to them, the teachings of His Word will ever be
          interesting and impressive.</p>
      <p>When Joshua went forth in the morning before the taking of Jericho, there appeared before him a warrior fully
          equipped for battle. And Joshua asked, “Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?” and he answered, “As Captain
          of the host of the Lord am I now come.” If the eyes of Joshua had been opened as were the eyes of the servant
          of Elisha at Dothan, and he could have endured the sight, he would have seen the angels of the Lord encamped
          about the children of Israel; for the trained army of heaven had come to ﬁght for the people of God, and the
          Captain of the Lord’s host was there to command. When Jericho fell, no human hand touched the walls of the
          city, for the angels of the Lord overthrew the fortiﬁcations, and entered the fortress of the enemy. It was
          not Israel, but the Captain of the Lord’s host that took Jericho. But Israel had their part to act to show
          their faith in the Captain of their salvation.</p>
      <p>Battles are to be fought every day. A great warfare is going on over every soul, between the prince of darkness
          and the Prince of life.... As God’s agents you are</p>
      <p>to yield yourselves to Him, that He may plan and direct and ﬁght the battle for you, with your cooperation. The
          Prince of life is at the head of His work. He is to be with you in your daily battle with self, that you may
          be true to principle; that passion, when warring for the mastery, may be subdued by the grace of Christ; that
          you come off more than conqueror through Him that hath loved us. Jesus has been over the ground. He knows the
          power of every temptation. He knows just how to meet every emergency, and how to guide you through every path
          of danger. Then why not trust Him?</p>
