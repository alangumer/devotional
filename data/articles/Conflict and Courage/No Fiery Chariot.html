    <h1>No Fiery Chariot</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>13:14-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from
          their labours; and their works do follow them. Revelation 14:13.</p>
      <p>It was not given Elisha to follow his master in a ﬁery chariot. Upon him the Lord permitted to come a lingering
          illness. During the long hours of human weakness and suffering his faith laid fast hold on the promises of
          God, and he beheld ever about him heavenly messengers of comfort and peace. As on the heights of Dothan he had
          seen the encircling hosts of heaven, the ﬁery chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof, so now he was
          conscious of the presence of sympathizing angels, and he was sustained. Throughout his life he had exercised
          strong faith, and as he had advanced in a knowledge of God’s providences and of His merciful kindness, faith
          had ripened into an abiding trust in his God, and when death called him he was ready to rest from his
          labors....</p>
      <p>Elisha could say in all conﬁdence, “God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive
          me.” And with rejoicing he could testify, “I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
          latter day upon the earth.” “As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisﬁed, when I
          awake, with thy likeness.”</p>
      <p>Christ claims all those as His who have believed in His name. The vitalizing power of the Spirit of Christ
          dwelling in the mortal body binds every believing soul to Jesus Christ. Those who believe in Jesus are sacred
          to His heart; for their life is hid with Christ in God....</p>
      <p>What a glorious morning will the resurrection morning be! What a wonderful scene will open when Christ shall
          come to be admired of them that believe! All who were partakers with Christ in His humiliation and sufferings
          will be partakers with Him in His glory. By the resurrection of Christ from the dead every believing saint who
          falls asleep in Jesus will come forth from his prison house in triumph. The resurrected saint will proclaim,
          “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? (1 Corinthians 15:55).</p>
