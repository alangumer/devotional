    <h1>The Source of Wisdom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Daniel <nobr>1:17-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep
          the law of the Lord thy God. 1 Chronicles 22:12.</p>
      <p>In acquiring the wisdom of the Babylonians, Daniel and his companions were far more successful than their
          fellow students; but their learning did not come by chance.... They placed themselves in connection with the
          Source of all wisdom,</p>
      <p>making the knowledge of God the foundation of their education. In faith they prayed for wisdom, and they lived
          their prayers. They placed themselves where God could bless them. They avoided that which would weaken their
          powers, and improved every opportunity to become intelligent in all lines of learning. They followed the rules
          of life that could not fail to give them strength of intellect. They sought to acquire knowledge for one
          <nobr>purpose—that</nobr> they might honor God.... In order to stand as representatives of true religion amid
          the false</p>
      <p>religions of heathenism they must have clearness of intellect and must perfect a Christian character. And God
          Himself was their teacher. Constantly praying, conscientiously studying, keeping in touch with the Unseen,
          they walked with God as did Enoch.</p>
      <p>True success in any line of work is not the result of chance or accident or destiny. It is the outworking of
          God’s providences, the reward of faith and discretion, of virtue and perseverance. Fine mental qualities and a
          high moral tone are not the result of accident. God gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of
          them....</p>
      <p>His grace is given to work in us to will and to do, but never as a substitute for our effort. As the Lord
          cooperated with Daniel and his fellows, so He will cooperate with all who strive to do His will. And by the
          impartation of His Spirit He will strengthen every true purpose, every noble resolution. Those who walk in the
          path of obedience will encounter many hindrances. Strong, subtle inﬂuences may bind them to the world; but the
          Lord is able to render futile every agency that works for the defeat of His chosen ones; in His strength they
          may overcome every temptation, conquer every difﬁculty.</p>
