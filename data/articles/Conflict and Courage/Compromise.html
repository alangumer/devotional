      <p><strong>Judges 14</strong></p>
      <p>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with
          unrighteousness? 2 Corinthians 6:14.</p>
      <p>The town of Zorah being near the country of the Philistines, Samson came to mingle with them on friendly terms.
          Thus in his youth intimacies sprang up, the inﬂuence of which darkened his whole life. A young woman dwelling
          in the Philistine town of Timnath engaged Samson’s affections, and he determined to make her his wife. To his
          <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> parents, who endeavored to dissuade him from his purpose, his only answer was, “She
          pleaseth me well.” The parents at last yielded to his wishes, and the marriage took place.</p>
      <p>Just as he was entering upon manhood, the time when he must execute his divine <nobr>mission—the</nobr> time
          above all others when he should have been true to <nobr>God—Samson</nobr> connected himself with the enemies
          of Israel. He did not ask whether he could better glorify God when united with the object of his choice, or
          whether he was placing himself in a position where he could not fulﬁll the purpose to be accomplished by his
          life. To all who seek ﬁrst to honor Him, God has promised wisdom; but there is no promise to those who are
          bent upon <nobr>self-pleasing....</nobr></p>
      <p>Christianity ought to have a controlling inﬂuence upon the marriage relation, but it is too often the case that
          the motives which lead to this union are not in keeping with Christian principles. Satan is constantly seeking
          to strengthen his power over the people of God by inducing them to enter into alliance with his subjects; and
          in order to accomplish this he endeavors to arouse unsanctiﬁed passions in the heart....</p>
      <p>At his marriage feast Samson was brought into familiar association with those who hated the God of Israel.
          Whoever voluntarily enters into such relations will feel it necessary to conform, to some degree, to the
          habits and customs of his companions. The time thus spent is worse than wasted. Thoughts are entertained and
          words are spoken, that tend to break down the strongholds of principle, and to weaken the citadel of the
          soul.</p>
