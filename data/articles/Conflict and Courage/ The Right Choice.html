    <h1>The Right Choice</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing
          rather to suffer afﬂiction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Hebrews
          11:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>In the schools of Egypt, Moses received the highest civil and military training. Of great personal attractions,
          noble in form and stature, of cultivated mind and princely bearing, and renowned as a military leader, he
          became the nation’s pride.</p>
      <p>All who occupied the throne of the Pharaohs must become members of the priestly caste; and Moses as the heir
          apparent, was to be initiated into the mysteries of the national religion.... But while he was an ardent and
          untiring</p>
      <p>student, he could not be induced to participate in the worship of the gods. He was threatened with the loss of
          the crown, and warned that he would be disowned by the princess should he persist in his adherence to the
          Hebrew faith. But he was unshaken in his determination to render homage to none save the one God....</p>
      <p>Moses was ﬁtted to take <nobr>pre-eminence</nobr> among the great of the earth, to shine in the courts of its
          most glorious kingdom, and to sway the scepter of its power. His intellectual greatness distinguishes him
          above the great men of all ages. As historian, poet, philosopher, general of armies, and legislator, he stands
          without a peer. Yet with the world before him, he had the moral strength to refuse the ﬂattering prospects of
          wealth and greatness and fame....</p>
      <p>Moses had been instructed in regard to the ﬁnal reward to be given to the humble and obedient servants of God,
          and worldly gain sank to its proper insigniﬁcance in comparison. The magniﬁcent palace of Pharaoh and the
          monarch’s throne were held out as an inducement to Moses; but he knew that the sinful pleasures that make men
          forget God were in its lordly courts. He looked beyond the gorgeous palace, beyond a monarch’s crown, to the
          high honors that will be bestowed on the saints of the Most High in a kingdom untainted by sin. He saw by
          faith an imperishable crown that the King of heaven would place on the brow of the overcomer.</p>
