    <h1>Used by Satan</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>3:6-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. Genesis
          3:6.</p>
      <p>Having herself transgressed, she [Eve] became the agent of Satan working the ruin of her husband. In a state of
          strange, unnatural excitement, with her hands ﬁlled with the forbidden fruit, she sought his presence, and
          related all that had occurred.</p>
      <p>An expression of sadness came over the face of Adam. He appeared astonished and alarmed. To the words of Eve he
          replied that this must be the foe against whom they had been warned; and by the divine sentence she must die.
          In answer she urged him to eat, repeating the words of the serpent, that they should not surely die. She
          reasoned that this must be true, for she felt no evidence of God’s displeasure, but on the contrary realized a
          delicious, exhilarating inﬂuence, thrilling every faculty with new life, such, she imagined, as inspired the
          heavenly messengers.</p>
      <p>Adam understood that his companion had transgressed the command of God, disregarded the only prohibition laid
          upon them as a test of their ﬁdelity and love. There was a terrible struggle in his mind. He mourned that he
          had permitted Eve to wander from his side. But now the deed was done; he must be separated from her whose
          society had been his joy. How could he have it thus? Adam had enjoyed the companionship of God and of holy
          angels. He had looked upon the glory of the Creator. He understood the high destiny opened to the human race
          should they remain faithful to God. Yet all these blessings were lost sight of in the fear of losing that one
          gift which in his eyes outvalued every other. Love, gratitude, loyalty to the <nobr>Creator—all</nobr> were
          overborne by love to Eve. She was a part of himself, and he could not endure the thought of separation....
          He</p>
      <p>resolved to share her fate; if she must die, he would die with her. After all, he reasoned, might not the words
          of the wise serpent be true? Eve was before him, as beautiful and apparently as innocent as before this act of
          disobedience. She expressed greater love for him than before. No sign of death appeared in her, and he decided
          to brave the consequences. He seized the fruit and quickly ate.</p>
