    <h1>John and Judas—A Contrast</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 1 John
          2:6.</strong></p>
      <p>In the life of the disciple John true sanctiﬁcation is exempliﬁed. During the years of his close association
          with Christ, he was often warned and cautioned by the Saviour; and these reproofs he accepted. As the
          character of the Divine One was manifested to him, John saw his own deﬁciencies, and was humbled by the
          revelation.... The power and tenderness, the majesty and meekness, the strength</p>
      <p>and patience, that he saw in the daily life of the Son of God, ﬁlled his soul with admiration. He yielded his
          resentful, ambitious temper to the molding power of Christ, and divine love wrought in him a transformation of
          character.</p>
      <p>In striking contrast to the sanctiﬁcation worked out in the life of John is the experience of his fellow
          disciple, Judas.... John warred earnestly against his</p>
      <p>faults; but Judas violated his conscience and yielded to temptation, fastening upon himself more securely his
          habits of evil....</p>
      <p>John and Judas are representatives of those who profess to be Christ’s followers. Both these disciples had the
          same opportunities to study and follow the divine Pattern. Both were closely associated with Jesus and were
          privileged to listen to His teaching. Each possessed serious defects of character; and each had access to the
          divine grace that transforms character. But while one in humility was learning of Jesus, the other revealed
          that he was not a doer of the word, but a hearer only. One, daily dying to self and overcoming sin, was
          sanctiﬁed through the truth; the other, resisting the transforming power of grace and indulging selﬁsh
          desires, was brought into bondage to Satan.</p>
      <p>Such transformation of character as is seen in the life of John is ever the result of communion with Christ.
          There may be marked defects in the character of an individual, yet when he becomes a true disciple of Christ,
          the power of divine grace transforms and sanctiﬁes him. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, he is
          changed from glory to glory, until he is like Him whom he adores.</p>
