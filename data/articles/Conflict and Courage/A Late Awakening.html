    <h1>A Late Awakening</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ecclesiastes</strong></p>
      <p>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and,
          behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no proﬁt under the sun. Ecclesiastes 2:11.</p>
      <p>By his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the emptiness of a life that seeks in earthly things its highest
          good. He erected altars to heathen gods, only to learn how vain is their promise of rest to the spirit. Gloomy
          and <nobr>soul-harassing</nobr> thoughts troubled him night and day. For him there was no longer any joy of
          life or peace of mind, and the future was dark with despair.</p>
      <p>Yet the Lord forsook him not. By messages of reproof and by severe judgments, He sought to arouse the king to a
          realization of the sinfulness of his course.... At last the Lord, through a prophet, delivered to Solomon the
          startling</p>
      <p>message: ... “I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. Notwithstanding in thy
          days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.”</p>
      <p>Awakened as from a dream by this sentence of judgment pronounced against him and his house, Solomon with
          quickened conscience began to see his folly in its true light. Chastened in spirit, with mind and body
          enfeebled, he turned wearied and thirsting from earth’s broken cisterns, to drink once more at the fountain of
          life.... He could never hope to escape the blasting results of sin;</p>
      <p>he could never free his mind from all remembrance of the <nobr>self-indulgent</nobr> course he had been
          pursuing; but he would endeavor earnestly to dissuade others from following after folly....</p>
      <p>The true penitent does not put his past sins from his remembrance. He does not, as soon as he has obtained
          peace, grow unconcerned in regard to the mistakes he has made. He thinks of those who have been led into evil
          by his course, and tries in every possible way to lead them back into the true path. The clearer the light
          that he has entered into, the stronger is his desire to set the feet of others in the right way.</p>
