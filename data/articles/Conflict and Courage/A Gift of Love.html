      <p>She hath done what she could. Mark 14:8.</p>
      <p>Simon of Bethany was accounted a disciple of Jesus. He was one of the few Pharisees who had openly joined
          Christ’s followers. He acknowledged Jesus as a teacher, and hoped that He might be the Messiah, but he had not
          accepted Him as a Saviour. His character was not transformed; his principles were unchanged.</p>
      <p>Simon had been healed of the leprosy, and it was this that had drawn him to Jesus. He desired to show his
          gratitude, and at Christ’s last visit to Bethany he made a feast for the Saviour and His disciples.... At the
          table the Saviour sat</p>
      <p>with Simon... on one side, and Lazarus ... on the other. Martha served at the table, but Mary was earnestly
          listening to every word from the lips of Jesus. In His mercy, Jesus had pardoned her sins, He had called forth
          her beloved brother from the grave, and Mary’s heart was ﬁlled with gratitude. She had heard Jesus speak of
          His approaching death, and in her deep love and sorrow she had longed to show Him honor. At great personal
          sacriﬁce she had purchased an alabaster box of “ointment of spikenard, very costly,” with which to anoint His
          body. But now many were declaring that He was about to be crowned king. Her grief was turned to joy, and she
          was eager to be ﬁrst in honoring her Lord. Breaking her box of ointment, she poured its contents upon the head
          and feet of Jesus; then, as she knelt weeping, moistening them with her tears, she wiped His feet with her
          long, ﬂowing hair....</p>
      <p>Judas looked upon this act with great displeasure.... He asked, “Why was</p>
      <p>not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?” ... The murmur passed round the table,
          “To what purpose is this waste?...” Mary heard the words of criticism.... She was about to shrink away, when
          the voice of her</p>
      <p>Lord was heard, “Let her alone; why trouble ye her?”... Lifting His voice above the murmur of criticism, He
          said, “She hath wrought a good work on me. For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may
          do them good: but me ye have not always. She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body
          to the burying.”</p>
