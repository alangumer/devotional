      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>19:12-29</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an
          ensample unto those that after should live ungodly. 2 Peter 2:6.</p>
      <p>The ﬂames that consumed the cities of the plain shed their warning light down even to our time. We are taught
          the fearful and solemn lesson that while God’s mercy bears long with the transgressor, there is a limit beyond
          which men may not go on in sin. When that limit is reached, then the offers of mercy are withdrawn, and the
          ministration of judgment begins.</p>
      <p>The Redeemer of the world declares that there are greater sins than that for which Sodom and Gomorrah were
          destroyed. Those who hear the gospel invitation calling sinners to repentance, and heed it not, are more
          guilty before God than were the dwellers in the vale of Siddim. And still greater sin is theirs who profess to
          know God and to keep His commandments, yet who deny Christ in their character and their daily life. In the
          light of the Saviour’s warning, the fate of Sodom is a solemn admonition ... to all who are triﬂing with
          <nobr>Heaven-sent</nobr> light and privileges.</p>
      <p>The judgments of God are soon to be poured out upon the earth. “Escape for thy life” is the warning from the
          angels of God. Other voices are heard saying: “Do not become excited; there is no cause for special alarm.”
          Those who are at ease in Zion cry “Peace and safety,” while heaven declares that swift destruction is about to
          come upon the transgressor. The young, the frivolous, the pleasure loving, consider these warnings as idle
          tales and turn from them with a jest. Parents are inclined to think their children about right in the matter,
          and all sleep on at ease. Thus it was at the destruction of the old world and when Sodom and Gomorrah were
          consumed by ﬁre. On the night prior to their destruction the cities of the plain rioted in pleasure. Lot was
          derided for his fears and warnings. But it was these scoffers that perished in the ﬂames. That very night the
          door of mercy was forever closed to the wicked, careless inhabitants of Sodom.</p>
      <p>The same voice that warned Lot to leave Sodom bids us, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, ...and
          touch not the unclean” (2 Corinthians 6:17). Those who obey this warning will ﬁnd a refuge.</p>
