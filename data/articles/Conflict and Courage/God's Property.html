    <h1>God’s Property</h1>

      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>1:19-28</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I have lent him to the Lord. 1 Samuel 1:28.</p>
      <p>From Shiloh, Hannah quietly returned to her home at Ramah, leaving the child Samuel to be trained for service
          in the house of God, under the instruction of the high priest. From the earliest dawn of intellect she had
          taught her son to love and reverence God and to regard himself as the Lord’s. By every familiar object
          surrounding him she had sought to lead his thoughts up to the Creator. When separated from her child, the
          faithful mother’s solicitude did not cease. Every day he was the subject of her prayers. Every year she made,
          with her own hands, a robe of service for him; and as she went up with her husband to worship at Shiloh, she
          gave the child this reminder of her love. Every ﬁber of the little garment had been woven with a prayer that
          he might be pure, noble, and true. She did not ask for her son worldly greatness, but she earnestly pleaded
          that he might attain that greatness which Heaven <nobr>values—that</nobr> he might honor God and bless his
          fellow men.</p>
      <p>What a reward was Hannah’s! and what an encouragement to faithfulness is her example! There are opportunities
          of inestimable worth, interests inﬁnitely precious, committed to every mother. The humble round of duties
          which women have come to regard as a wearisome task should be looked upon as a grand and noble work. It is the
          mother’s privilege to bless the world by her inﬂuence, and in doing this she will bring joy to her own heart.
          She may make straight paths for the feet of her children, through sunshine and shadow, to the glorious heights
          above. But it is only when she seeks, in her own life, to follow the teachings of Christ that the mother can
          hope to form the character of her children after the divine pattern. The world teems with corrupting
          inﬂuences. Fashion and custom exert a strong power over the young. If the mother fails in her duty to
          instruct, guide, and restrain, her children will naturally accept the evil, and turn from the good. Let every
          mother go often to her Saviour with the prayer, “Teach us, how shall we order the child, and what shall we do
          unto him?” Let her heed the instruction which God has given in His word, and wisdom will be given her as she
          shall have need.</p>
