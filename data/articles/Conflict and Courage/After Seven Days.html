    <h1>After Seven Days</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis 7</strong></p>
      <p>And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the ﬂood were upon the earth. Genesis 7:10.</p>
      <p>For seven days after Noah and his family entered the ark, there appeared no sign of the coming storm. During
          this period their faith was tested. It was a time of triumph to the world without. The apparent delay conﬁrmed
          them in the belief that Noah’s message was a delusion, and that the Flood would never come. Notwithstanding
          the solemn scenes which they had witnessed ... they still continued their sport and revelry, even making a
          jest of these signal manifestations of God’s power. They gathered in crowds about the ark, deriding its
          inmates with a daring violence which they had never ventured upon before.</p>
      <p>At the end of seven days clouds began to gather. This was a new sight; for the people had never seen clouds....
          Soon rain began to fall. Still the people tried to</p>
      <p>think that this was nothing very alarming.... For a time the ground drank up the</p>
      <p>rain; but soon the water began to rise, and day by day it rose higher and higher. Each morning as the people
          found the rain still falling they looked at one another in despair, and each night they repeated the words,
          “Raining still!”</p>
      <p>The people ﬁrst beheld the destruction of the works of their own hands. Their splendid buildings, and the
          beautiful gardens and groves where they had placed their idols, were destroyed by lightning from heaven, and
          the ruins were scattered far and wide.... The terror of man and beast was beyond description. Above</p>
      <p>the roar of the tempest was heard the wailing of a people that had despised the authority of God.... In that
          terrible hour they saw that the transgression of</p>
      <p>God’s law had caused their ruin. Yet while, through fear of punishment, they acknowledged their sin, they felt
          no true contrition, no abhorrence of evil. They would have returned to their deﬁance of Heaven, had the
          judgment been removed. So when God’s judgments shall fall upon the earth before its deluge by ﬁre, the
          impenitent will know just where and what their sin <nobr>is—the</nobr> despising of His holy law. Yet they
          will have no more true repentance than did the <nobr>old-world</nobr> sinners.</p>
