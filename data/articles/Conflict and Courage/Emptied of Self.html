      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>18:41-46</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it
          rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave
          rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. James 5:17, 18.</p>
      <p>Important lessons are presented to us in the experience of Elijah. When upon Mt. Carmel he offered the prayer
          for rain, his faith was tested, but he persevered in making known his request unto God.... Had he given up in
          discouragement at</p>
      <p>the sixth time, his prayer would not have been answered, but he persevered till the answer came. We have a God
          whose ear is not closed to our petitions; and if we prove His word, He will honor our faith. He wants us to
          have all our interests interwoven with His interests, and then He can safely bless us; for we shall not then
          take glory to self when the blessing is ours, but shall render all the praise to God. God does not always
          answer our prayers the ﬁrst time we call upon Him; for should He do this, we might take it for granted that we
          had a right to all the blessings and favors He bestowed upon us. Instead of searching our hearts to see if any
          evil was entertained by us, any sin indulged, we should become careless, and fail to realize our dependence
          upon Him, and our need of His help.</p>
      <p>Elijah humbled himself until he was in a condition where he would not take the glory to himself. This is the
          condition upon which the Lord hears prayer, for then we shall give the praise to Him. The custom of offering
          praise to men is one that results in great evil. One praises another, and thus men are led to feel that glory
          and honor belong to them. When you exalt man, you lay a snare for his soul, and do just as Satan would have
          you.... God alone is worthy to be gloriﬁed.</p>
      <p>As he [Elijah] searched his heart, he seemed to be less and less, both in his own estimation and in the sight
          of God. It seemed to him that he was nothing, and that God was everything; and when he reached the point of
          renouncing self, while he clung to the Saviour as his only strength and righteousness, the answer came.</p>
