      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>17:4-29</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may ﬁght together. 1
          Samuel 17:10.</p>
      <p>When war was declared by Israel against the Philistines, three of the sons of Jesse joined the army under Saul;
          but David remained at home. After a time, however, he went to visit the camp of Saul. By his father’s
          direction he was to carry a message and a gift to his elder brothers and to learn if they were still in safety
          and health.... As David drew near to the army, he heard the sound of</p>
      <p>commotion, as if an engagement was about to begin....</p>
      <p>Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, came forth, and with insulting language deﬁed Israel and challenged
          them to provide a man from their ranks who would meet him in single combat....</p>
      <p>For forty days the host of Israel had trembled before the haughty challenge of the Philistine giant. Their
          hearts failed within them as they looked upon his massive form, in height measuring six cubits and a span.
          Upon his head was a helmet of brass, he was clothed with a coat of mail that weighed ﬁve thousand shekels, and
          he had greaves of brass upon his legs. The coat was made of plates of brass that overlaid one another, like
          the scales of a ﬁsh, and they were so closely joined that no dart or arrow could possibly penetrate the armor.
          At his back the giant bore a huge javelin, or lance, also of brass. “The staff of his spear was like a
          weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and one bearing a shield went before
          him.”</p>
      <p>Israel did not defy Goliath, but Goliath made his proud boasts against God and His people. The defying, the
          boasting, and the railing must come from the opposers of truth, who act the Goliath. But none of this spirit
          should be seen in those whom God has sent forth to proclaim the last message of warning to a doomed
          world.</p>
      <p>Goliath trusted in his armor. He terriﬁed the armies of Israel by his deﬁant, savage boastings, while he made a
          most imposing display of his armor, which was his strength.</p>
