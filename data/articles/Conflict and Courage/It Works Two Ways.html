    <h1>It Works Two Ways</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>14:36-46</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
          again. Matthew 7:2.</p>
      <p>Saul could not but feel that his son was preferred before him, both by the people and by the Lord. Jonathan’s
          deliverance was a severe reproof to the king’s rashness. He felt a presentiment that his curses would return
          upon his own head. He did not longer continue the war with the Philistines, but returned to his home, moody
          and dissatisﬁed.</p>
      <p>Those who are most ready to excuse or justify themselves in sin are often most severe in judging and condemning
          others. Many, like Saul, bring upon themselves the displeasure of God, but they reject counsel and despise
          reproof. Even when convinced that the Lord is not with them, they refuse to see in themselves the cause of
          their trouble. They cherish a proud, boastful spirit, while they indulge in cruel judgment or severe rebuke of
          others who are better than they....</p>
      <p>Often those who are seeking to exalt themselves are brought into positions where their true character is
          revealed. So it was in the case of Saul. His own course convinced the people that kingly honor and authority
          were dearer to him than justice, mercy, or benevolence. Thus the people were led to see their error in
          rejecting the government that God had given them. They had exchanged the pious prophet, whose prayers had
          brought down blessings, for a king who in his blind zeal had prayed for a curse upon them.</p>
      <p>Had not the men of Israel interposed to save the life of Jonathan, their deliverer would have perished by the
          king’s decree. With what misgivings must that people afterward have followed Saul’s guidance! How bitter the
          thought that he had been placed upon the throne by their own act! The Lord bears long with the waywardness of
          men, and to all He grants opportunity to see and forsake their sins; but while He may seem to prosper those
          who disregard His will and despise His warnings, He will, in His own time, surely make manifest their
          folly.</p>
