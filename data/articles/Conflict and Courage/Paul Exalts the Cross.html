    <h1>Paul Exalts the Cross</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>17:15-33</nobr> to Acts 18:4</strong></p>
      <p>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him cruciﬁed.... And my speech and my
          preaching was not with enticing</p>
      <p>words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. 1 Corinthians <nobr>2:2-4.</nobr></p>
      <p>It had been Paul’s custom to adopt an oratorical style in his preaching. He was a man ﬁtted to speak before
          kings, before the great and learned men of Athens, and his intellectual acquirements were often of value to
          him in preparing the way for the gospel. He tried to do this in Athens, meeting eloquence with eloquence,
          philosophy with philosophy, and logic with logic; but he failed to meet with the success he had hoped for. His
          aftersight led him to understand that there was something needed above human wisdom.... He must receive his
          power from a</p>
      <p>higher source. In order to convict and convert sinners, the Spirit of God must come into his work and sanctify
          every spiritual development.</p>
      <p>To Paul the cross was the one object of supreme interest. Ever since he had been arrested in his career of
          persecution against the followers of the cruciﬁed Nazarene he had never ceased to glory in the cross.... He
          knew by personal</p>
      <p>experience that when a sinner once beholds the love of the Father, as seen in the sacriﬁce of His Son, and
          yields to the divine inﬂuence, a change of heart takes place, and henceforth Christ is all and in all.</p>
      <p>At the time of his conversion, Paul was inspired with a longing desire to help his fellow men to behold Jesus
          of Nazareth as the Son of the living God, mighty to transform and to save. Henceforth his life was wholly
          devoted to an effort to portray the love and power of the Cruciﬁed One.... The apostle’s efforts were not</p>
      <p>conﬁned to public speaking; there were many who could not have been reached in that way.... He visited the sick
          and the sorrowing, comforted the afﬂicted, and</p>
      <p>lifted up the oppressed. And in all that he said and did he magniﬁed the name of Jesus....</p>
      <p>Paul realized that his sufﬁciency was not in himself, but in the presence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious
          inﬂuence ﬁlled his heart.... Self was hidden; Christ</p>
      <p>was revealed and exalted.</p>
