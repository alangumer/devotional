    <h1>Rebellion in the Camp</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers 16</strong></p>
      <p>These men are arrogant and <nobr>presumptuous—they</nobr> think nothing of scofﬁng at the glories of the unseen
          world. 2 Peter 2:10, Phillips.</p>
      <p>It is hardly possible for men to offer greater insult to God than to despise and reject the instrumentalities
          He would use for their salvation....</p>
      <p>In the rebellion of Korah is seen the working out, upon a narrower stage, of the same spirit that led to the
          rebellion of Satan in heaven. It was pride and ambition that prompted Lucifer to complain of the government of
          God, and to seek the overthrow of the order which had been established in heaven. Since his fall it has been
          his object to infuse the same spirit of envy and discontent, the same ambition for position and honor, into
          the minds of men. He thus worked upon the minds of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, to arouse the desire for
          <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> and excite envy, distrust, and rebellion. Satan caused them to reject God as
          their leader, by rejecting the men of God’s appointment. Yet while in their murmuring against Moses and Aaron
          they blasphemed God, they were so deluded as to think themselves righteous, and to regard those who had
          faithfully reproved their sins as actuated by Satan.</p>
      <p>Do not the same evils still exist that lay at the foundation of Korah’s ruin? Pride and ambition are
          widespread; and when these are cherished, they open the door to envy, and a striving for supremacy; the soul
          is alienated from God, and unconsciously drawn into the ranks of Satan.... While endeavoring to destroy
          the</p>
      <p>conﬁdence of the people in the men of God’s appointment, they really believe that they are engaged in a good
          work, verily doing God service....</p>
      <p>It is by sinful indulgence that men give Satan access to their minds, and they go from one stage of wickedness
          to another. The rejection of light darkens the mind and hardens the heart, so that it is easier for them to
          take the next step in sin and to reject still clearer light, until at last their habits of wrongdoing become
          ﬁxed. Sin ceases to appear sinful to them.</p>
