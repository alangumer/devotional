    <h1>He Walked with God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>5:21-24</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Enoch lived sixty and ﬁve years, and begat Methuselah: and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah
          three hundred years. Genesis 5:21, 22.</p>
      <p>Of Enoch it is written that he lived <nobr>sixty-ﬁve</nobr> years, and begat a son....</p>
      <p>During these earlier years Enoch had loved and feared God and had kept His commandments.... But after the birth
          of his ﬁrst son, Enoch reached a higher</p>
      <p>experience; he was drawn into a closer relationship with God. He realized more fully his own obligations and
          responsibility as a son of God. And as he saw the child’s love for its father, its simple trust in his
          protection; as he felt the deep, yearning tenderness of his own heart for that ﬁrstborn son, he learned a
          precious lesson of the wonderful love of God to men in the gift of His Son, and the conﬁdence which the
          children of God may repose in their heavenly Father. The inﬁnite, unfathomable love of God through Christ
          became the subject of his meditation day and night; and with all the fervor of his soul he sought to reveal
          that love to the people among whom he dwelt.</p>
      <p>Enoch’s walk with God was not in a trance or a vision, but in all the duties of his daily life. He did not
          become a hermit, shutting himself entirely from the world; for he had a work to do for God in the world. In
          the family and in his intercourse with men, as a husband and father, a friend, a citizen, he was the
          steadfast, unwavering servant of the Lord.... And this holy walk was continued</p>
      <p>for three hundred years. There are few Christians who would not be far more earnest and devoted if they knew
          that they had but a short time to live, or that the coming of Christ was about to take place. But Enoch’s
          faith waxed the stronger, his love became more ardent, with the lapse of centuries.</p>
      <p>He [Enoch] was of one mind with God.... If we are of one mind with God, our</p>
      <p>will will be swallowed up in God’s will, and we shall follow wherever God leads the way. As a loving child
          places his hand in that of his father, and walks with him in perfect trust whether it is dark or bright, so
          the sons and daughters of God are to walk with Jesus through joy or sorrow.</p>
