    <h1>Growing Old Gracefully</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. Psalm
          71:9.</strong></p>
      <p>David entreated the Lord not to forsake him in old age. And why did he thus pray? He saw that most of the aged
          around him were unhappy, because of the unfortunate traits of their character being increased with their age.
          If they had been naturally close and covetous, they were most disagreeably so in mature years. If they had
          been jealous, fretful, and impatient, they were especially so when aged.</p>
      <p>David was distressed as he saw that kings and nobles who seemed to have the fear of God before them while in
          the strength of manhood, became jealous of their best friends and relatives when aged. They were in continual
          fear that it was selﬁsh motives which led their friends to manifest an interest for them. They would listen to
          the hints and the deceptive advice of strangers in regard to those in whom they should conﬁde. Their
          unrestrained jealousy sometimes burned into a ﬂame because all did not agree with their failing judgment.
          Their covetousness was dreadful. They often thought that their own children and relatives were wishing them to
          die in order to take their place and possess their wealth, and receive the homage which had been bestowed upon
          them. And some were so controlled by their jealous, covetous feelings as to destroy their own children.</p>
      <p>David marked that although the lives of some while in the strength of manhood had been righteous, as old age
          came upon them they seemed to lose their <nobr>self-control.</nobr> Satan stepped in and guided their minds,
          making them restless and dissatisﬁed....</p>
      <p>David was deeply moved; he was distressed as he looked forward to the time when he should be aged. He feared
          that God would leave him and that he would be as unhappy as other aged persons whose course he had noticed,
          and would be left to the reproach of the enemies of the Lord. With his burden upon him he earnestly prays:
          “Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.”</p>
