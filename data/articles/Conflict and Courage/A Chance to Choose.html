    <h1>A Chance to Choose</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>2:16-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest
          thereof thou shalt surely die. Genesis 2:17.</p>
      <p>Our ﬁrst parents, though created innocent and holy, were not placed beyond the possibility of wrongdoing....
          They were to enjoy communion with God and</p>
      <p>with holy angels; but before they could be rendered eternally secure, their loyalty must be tested. At the very
          beginning of man’s existence a check was placed upon the desire for <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> the fatal
          passion that lay at the foundation of Satan’s fall. The tree of knowledge, which stood near the tree of life
          in the midst of the garden, was to be a test of the obedience, faith, and love of our ﬁrst parents. While
          permitted to eat freely of every other tree, they were forbidden to taste of this, on pain of death. They were
          also to be exposed to the temptations of Satan; but if they endured the trial, they would ﬁnally be placed
          beyond his power, to enjoy perpetual favor with God....</p>
      <p>God might have created man without the power to transgress His law; He might have withheld the hand of Adam
          from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free moral agent, but a mere
          automation. Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been voluntary, but forced. There could
          have been no development of character.... It would have been</p>
      <p>unworthy of man as an intelligent being, and would have sustained Satan’s charge of God’s arbitrary rule.</p>
      <p>God made man upright; He gave him noble traits of character, with no bias toward evil. He endowed him with high
          intellectual powers, and presented before him the strongest possible inducements to be true to his allegiance.
          Obedience, perfect and perpetual, was the condition of eternal happiness. On this condition he was to have
          access to the tree of life....</p>
      <p>So long as they remained loyal to the divine law, their capacity to know, to enjoy, and to love would
          continually increase. They would be constantly gaining new treasures of knowledge, discovering fresh springs
          of happiness, and obtaining clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the immeasurable, unfailing love of
          God.</p>
