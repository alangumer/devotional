    <h1>Confrontation at Jacob’s Well</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>4:4-42</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him
          shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. John 4:14.</p>
      <p>When Jesus sat down to rest at Jacob’s well, He had come from Judea, where His ministry had produced little
          fruit.... He was faint and weary; yet He did not</p>
      <p>neglect the opportunity of speaking to one woman, though she was a stranger, an alien from Israel, and living
          in open sin.</p>
      <p>As the woman talked with Jesus, she was impressed with His words.... She</p>
      <p>realized her soul thirst, which the waters of the well of Sychar could never satisfy. Nothing that had hitherto
          come in contact with her had so awakened her to a higher need. Jesus had convinced her that He read the
          secrets of her life; yet he felt that He was her friend, pitying and loving her. While the very purity of His
          presence condemned her sin, He had spoken no word of denunciation, but had told her of His grace, that could
          renew the soul....</p>
      <p>Leaving her waterpot, she returned to the city, to carry the message to others....</p>
      <p>With heart overﬂowing with gladness, she hastened on her way, to impart to others the precious light she had
          received.</p>
      <p>“Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did,” she said to the men of the city. “Is not this the
          Christ?” Her words touched their hearts. There was a new expression on her face, a change in her whole
          appearance. They were interested to see Jesus.</p>
      <p>As soon as she had found the Saviour the Samaritan woman brought others to Him. She proved herself a more
          effective missionary than His own disciples....</p>
      <p>Their thoughts were ﬁxed upon a great work to be done in the future. They did not see that right around them
          was a harvest to be gathered. But through the woman whom they despised, a whole cityful were brought to hear
          the Saviour....</p>
      <p>This woman represents the working of a practical faith in Christ. Every true disciple is born into the kingdom
          of God as a missionary. He who drinks of the living water becomes a fountain of life. The receiver becomes a
          giver.</p>
