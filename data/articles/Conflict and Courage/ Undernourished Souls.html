      <p><strong>Numbers <nobr>11:4-35</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and
          tempted God in the desert. And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. Psalm
          <nobr>106:13-15.</nobr></p>
      <p>Whenever their appetite was restricted, the Israelites were dissatisﬁed, and murmured and complained against
          Moses and Aaron, and against God.</p>
      <p>God gave the people that which was not for their highest good, because they persisted in desiring it; they
          would not be satisﬁed with those things that would prove a beneﬁt to them. Their rebellious desires were
          gratiﬁed, but they were left to suffer the result. They feasted without restraint, and their excesses were
          speedily punished.... Large numbers were cut down by burning fevers, while the</p>
      <p>most guilty among them were smitten as soon as they tasted the food for which they had lusted.</p>
      <p>God might as easily have provided them with ﬂesh as with manna, but a restriction was placed upon them for
          their good. It was His purpose to supply them with food better suited to their wants than the feverish diet to
          which many had become accustomed in Egypt. The perverted appetite was to be brought into a more healthy state,
          that they might enjoy the food originally provided for <nobr>man—the</nobr> fruits of the earth, which God
          gave to Adam and Eve in Eden. It was for this reason that the Israelites had been deprived, in a great
          measure, of animal food.</p>
      <p>Satan tempted them to regard this restriction as unjust and cruel. He caused them to lust after forbidden
          things, because he saw that the unrestrained indulgence of appetite would tend to produce sensuality, and by
          this means the people could be more easily brought under his control. The author of disease and misery will
          assail men where he can have the greatest success. Through temptations addressed to the appetite he has, to a
          large extent, led men into sin from the time when he induced Eve to eat of the forbidden fruit. It was by this
          same means that he led Israel to murmur against God. Intemperance in eating and drinking, leading as it does
          to the indulgence of the lower passions, prepares the way for men to disregard all moral obligations. When
          assailed by temptation, they have little power of resistance.</p>
