    <h1>Marrying and Giving in Marriage</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>6:1-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>In the days that were before the ﬂood they were ... marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
          entered into the ark. Matthew 24:38.</p>
      <p>In Noah’s day brute force was the prevailing inﬂuence in the world. By threatened punishment, men intimidated
          other men.</p>
      <p>Instead of doing justice to their neighbors, they carried out their own unlawful wishes. They had a plurality
          of wives, which was contrary to God’s wise arrangement. In the beginning God gave to Adam one
          <nobr>wife—showing</nobr> to all who should live upon the earth, his order and law in that respect. The
          transgression and fall of Adam and Eve brought sin and wretchedness upon the human race, and man followed his
          own carnal desires, and changed God’s order. The more men multiplied wives to themselves, the more they
          increased in wickedness and unhappiness. If one chose to take the wives, or cattle, or anything belonging to
          his neighbor, he did not regard justice or right but if he could prevail over his neighbor by reason of
          strength, or by putting him to death, he did so, and exulted in his deeds of violence. They loved to destroy
          the lives of animals. They used them for food, and this increased their ferocity and violence, and caused them
          to look upon the blood of human beings with astonishing indifference.</p>
      <p>The descendants of Seth were called the sons of God; the descendants of Cain, the sons of men. As the sons of
          God mingled with the sons of men, they became corrupt and, by intermarriage with them, lost, through the
          inﬂuence of their wives, their peculiar, holy character, and united with the sons of Cain in their idolatry.
          Many cast aside the fear of God and trampled upon His commandments. But there were a few that did
          righteousness, who feared and honored their Creator. Noah and his family were among the righteous few.</p>
      <p>Polygamy was practiced at an early date. It was one of the sins that brought the wrath of God upon the
          antediluvian world.... It was Satan’s studied effort</p>
      <p>to pervert the marriage institution, to weaken its obligations and lessen its sacredness; for in no surer way
          could he deface the image of God in man and open the door to misery and vice.</p>
