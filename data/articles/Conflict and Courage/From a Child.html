    <h1>“From a Child”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Timothy <nobr>3:14-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
          which is in Christ Jesus. 2 Timothy 3:15.</p>
      <p>We see the advantage that Timothy had in a correct example of piety and true godliness. Religion was the
          atmosphere of his home. The manifest spiritual power of the piety in the home kept him pure in speech, and
          free from all corrupting sentiments.</p>
      <p>God had commanded the Hebrews to teach their children His requirements and to make them acquainted with all His
          dealings with their fathers. This was one of the special duties of every <nobr>parent—one</nobr> that was not
          to be delegated to another. In the place of stranger lips the loving hearts of the father and mother were to
          give instruction to their children. Thoughts of God were to be associated with all the events of daily life.
          The mighty works of God in the deliverance of His people and the promises of the Redeemer to come were to be
          often recounted in the homes of Israel.... The great truths of God’s providence and of the future life</p>
      <p>were impressed on the young mind. It was trained to see God alike in the scenes of nature and the words of
          revelation. The stars of heaven, the trees and ﬂowers of the ﬁeld, the lofty mountains, the rippling
          <nobr>brooks—all</nobr> spoke of the Creator. The solemn service of sacriﬁce and worship at the sanctuary and
          the utterances of the prophets were a revelation of God.</p>
      <p>Such was the training of Moses in the lowly cabin home in Goshen; of Samuel, by the faithful Hannah; of David,
          in the hill dwelling at Bethlehem; of Daniel, before the scenes of the captivity separated him from the home
          of his fathers. Such, too, was the early life of Christ at Nazareth; such the training by which the child
          Timothy learned from the lips of his grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice, the truths of Holy Writ.</p>
      <p>Parents, there is a great work for you to do for Jesus.... Satan seeks to bind the</p>
      <p>children to himself as with bands of steel, and you can attain success in bringing them to Jesus only through
          determined personal effort.</p>
