    <h1>Music in a Cave</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel 22</strong></p>
      <p>My soul is among lions; and I lie even among them that are set on ﬁre. Psalm 57:4.</p>
      <p>Oh, how precious is the sweet inﬂuence of the Spirit of God as it comes to depressed or despairing souls,
          encouraging the fainthearted, strengthening the feeble, and imparting courage and help to the tried servants
          of the Lord! Oh, what a God is ours, who deals gently with the erring and manifests His patience and
          tenderness in adversity, and when we are overwhelmed with some great sorrow!</p>
      <p>Every failure on the part of the children of God is due to their lack of faith. When shadows encompass the
          soul, when we want light and guidance, we must look up: there is light beyond the darkness. David ought not to
          have distrusted God for one moment. He had cause for trusting in Him; he was the Lord’s anointed, and in the
          midst of danger he had been protected by the angels of God; he had been armed with courage to do wonderful
          things; and if he had but removed his mind from the distressing situation in which he was placed and had
          thought of God’s power and majesty, he would have been at peace even in the midst of the shadows of
          death....</p>
      <p>Among the mountains of Judah, David sought refuge from the pursuit of Saul. He made good his escape to the cave
          of Adullam, a place that, with a small force, could be held against a large army. “And when his brethren and
          all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.” ...</p>
      <p>In the cave of Adullam the family were united in sympathy and affection. The son of Jesse could make melody
          with voice and harp as he sang, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
          unity!” (Psalm 133:1). He had tasted the bitterness of distrust on the part of his own brothers; and the
          harmony that had taken the place of discord brought joy to the exile’s heart. It was here that David composed
          the <nobr>ﬁfty-seventh</nobr> psalm.</p>
