    <h1>What Fruit?</h1>

      <p><strong>They that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. Job 4:8.</strong></p>
      <p>As an educator no part of the Bible is of greater value than are its biographies. These biographies differ from
          all others in that they are absolutely true to life. It is impossible for any ﬁnite mind to interpret rightly,
          in all things, the workings of another. None but He who reads the heart, who discerns the secret springs of
          motive and action, can with absolute truth delineate character, or give a faithful picture of a human life. In
          God’s word alone is found such delineation.</p>
      <p>No truth does the Bible more clearly teach than that what we do is the result of what we are. To a great degree
          the experiences of life are the fruition of our own thoughts and deeds.</p>
      <p>“The curse causeless shall not come” (Proverbs 26:2). “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with
          him.... Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill</p>
      <p>with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him” (Isaiah 3:10, 11). “Hear,</p>
      <p>O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts” (Jeremiah 6:19).
          Terrible is this truth, and deeply should it be impressed. Every deed reacts upon the doer. Never a human
          being but may recognize, in the evils that curse his life, fruitage of his own sowing. Yet even thus we are
          not without hope....</p>
      <p>Jacob resorted to fraud, and he reaped the harvest in his brother’s hatred. Through twenty years of exile he
          was himself wronged and defrauded.... But</p>
      <p>God says: “... I have seen his ways, and will heal him....” (Isaiah 57:18). Jacob in</p>
      <p>his distress was not overwhelmed. He had repented, he had endeavored to atone for the wrong to his brother. And
          when threatened with death through the wrath of Esau, he sought help from God.... “He wept, and made
          supplication” (Hosea</p>
      <p>12:4). “And he blessed him there” (Genesis 32:29).... The power of evil in his</p>
      <p>own nature was broken; his character was transformed....</p>
      <p>God does not annul His laws. He does not work contrary to them. The work of sin He does not undo. But He
          transforms. Through His grace the curse works out blessing.</p>
