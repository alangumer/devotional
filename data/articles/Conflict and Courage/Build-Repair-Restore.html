    <h1>Build—Repair—Restore</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of
          many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
          Isaiah 58:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In the work of reform to be carried forward today, there is need of men who, like Ezra and Nehemiah, will not
          palliate or excuse sin, nor shrink from vindicating the honor of God. Those upon whom rests the burden of this
          work will not hold their peace when wrong is done, neither will they cover evil with a cloak of false charity.
          They will remember that God is no respecter of persons, and that severity to a few may prove mercy to many.
          They will remember also that in the one who rebukes evil the spirit of Christ should ever be revealed.</p>
      <p>In their work, Ezra and Nehemiah humbled themselves before God, confessing their sins and the sins of their
          people, and entreating pardon as if they themselves were the offenders.... Nehemiah was not a priest; he was
          not</p>
      <p>a prophet; he made no pretension to high title. He was a reformer raised up for an important time. It was his
          aim to set his people right with God. Inspired with a great purpose, he bent every energy of his being to its
          accomplishment.... As he</p>
      <p>came into contact with evil and opposition to right he took so determined a stand that the people were roused
          to labor with fresh zeal and courage....</p>
      <p>The work of restoration and reform carried on by the returned exiles, under the leadership of Zerubbabel, Ezra,
          and Nehemiah, presents a picture of a work of spiritual restoration that is to be wrought in the closing days
          of this earth’s history.... God’s remnant people, standing before the world as reformers, are</p>
      <p>to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring reform and that the Sabbath of the fourth
          commandment is to stand as a memorial of creation, a constant reminder of the power of God. In clear, distinct
          lines they are to present the necessity of obedience to all the precepts of the Decalogue. Constrained by the
          love of Christ, they are to <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with Him in building up the waste places. They are to be
          repairers of the breach, restorers of paths to dwell in.</p>
