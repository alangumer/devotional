    <h1>The Living Coal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Isaiah <nobr>6:1-10</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then ﬂew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from
          off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is
          taken away, and thy sin purged. Isaiah 6:6, 7.</p>
      <p>Isaiah had denounced the sin of others; but now he sees himself exposed to the same condemnation he had
          pronounced upon them. He had been satisﬁed with a cold, lifeless ceremony in his worship of God. He had not
          known this until the vision was given him of the Lord. How little now appeared his wisdom and talents as he
          looked upon the sacredness and majesty of the sanctuary. How unworthy he was! how unﬁtted for sacred service!
          ...</p>
      <p>The vision given to Isaiah represents the condition of God’s people in the last days. They are privileged to
          see by faith the work that is going forward in the heavenly sanctuary. “And the temple of God was opened in
          heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament.” As they look by faith into the holy of
          holies, and see the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, they perceive that they are a people of unclean
          <nobr>lips,—a</nobr> people whose lips have often spoken vanity, and whose talents have not been sanctiﬁed and
          employed to the glory of God. Well may they despair as they contrast their own weakness and unworthiness with
          the purity and loveliness of the glorious character of Christ. But if they, like Isaiah, will receive the
          impression the Lord designs shall be made upon the heart, if they will humble their souls before God, there is
          hope for them. The bow of promise is above the throne, and the work done for Isaiah will be performed in them.
          God will respond to the petitions coming from the contrite heart.</p>
      <p>We want the living coal from off the altar placed upon our lips. We want to hear the word spoken, “Thine
          iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.”</p>
      <p>The live coal is symbolical of puriﬁcation. If it touches the lips, no impure word will fall from them.</p>
