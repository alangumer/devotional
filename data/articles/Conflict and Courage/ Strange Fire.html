    <h1>Strange Fire</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Leviticus <nobr>10:1-11</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put ﬁre therein, and put incense
          thereon, and offered strange ﬁre before the Lord, which he commanded them not. Leviticus 10:1.</p>
      <p>Next to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu had stood highest in Israel. They had been especially honored by the
          Lord, having been permitted with the seventy elders to behold His glory in the mount. But their transgression
          was not therefore to be excused or lightly regarded. All this rendered their sin more grievous. Because men
          have received great light, because they have, like the princes of Israel, ascended to the mount, and been
          privileged to have communion with God, and to dwell in the light of His glory, let them not ﬂatter themselves
          that they can afterward sin with impunity, that because they have been thus honored, God will not be strict to
          punish their iniquity. This is a fatal deception. The great light and privileges bestowed require returns of
          virtue and holiness corresponding to the light given. Anything short of this, God cannot accept. Great
          blessings or privileges should never lull to security or carelessness. They should never give license to sin
          or cause the recipients to feel that God will not be exact with them....</p>
      <p>Nadab and Abihu had not in their youth been trained to habits of <nobr>self-control....</nobr></p>
      <p>Habits of <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> long cherished, obtained a hold upon them which even the responsibility
          of the most sacred ofﬁce had not power to break. They had not been taught to respect the authority of their
          father, and they did not realize the necessity of exact obedience to the requirements of God. Aaron’s mistaken
          indulgence of his sons prepared them to become the subjects of the divine judgments.</p>
      <p>God designed to teach the people that they must approach Him with reverence and awe, and in His own appointed
          manner. He cannot accept partial obedience. It was not enough that in this solemn season of worship nearly
          everything was done as He had directed.... Let no one deceive himself with the belief that a part</p>
      <p>of God’s commandments are nonessential, or that He will accept a substitute for that which He has
          required.</p>
