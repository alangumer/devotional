    <h1>Enslaved by Money</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>26:14-16;</nobr> Matthew <nobr>26:47-49;</nobr> Matthew <nobr>27:3-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, and said unto them, What will ye
          give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. Matthew
          26:14, 15.</p>
      <p>Judas had naturally a strong love for money; but he had not always been corrupt enough to do such a deed as
          this. He had fostered the evil spirit of avarice until it had become the ruling motive of his life. The love
          of mammon overbalanced his love for Christ. Through becoming the slave of one vice he gave himself to
          Satan....</p>
      <p>Judas was highly regarded by the disciples, and had great inﬂuence over them. He himself had a high opinion of
          his own qualiﬁcations, and looked upon his brethren as greatly inferior to him in judgment and ability. They
          did not see their opportunities, he thought, and take advantage of circumstances. The church would never
          prosper with such shortsighted men as leaders. Peter was impetuous; he would move without consideration. John,
          who was treasuring up the truths that fell from Christ’s lips, was looked upon by Judas as a poor ﬁnancier.
          Matthew, whose training had taught him accuracy in all things, was very particular in regard to honesty, and
          he was ever contemplating the words of Christ, and became so absorbed in them that, as Judas thought, he could
          not be trusted to do sharp, farseeing business. Thus Judas summed up all the disciples, and ﬂattered himself
          that the church would often be brought into perplexity and embarrassment if it were not for his ability as a
          manager.</p>
      <p>The history of Judas presents the sad ending of a life that might have been honored of God. Had Judas died
          before his last journey to Jerusalem he would have been regarded as a man worthy of a place among the twelve,
          and one who would be greatly missed. The abhorrence which has followed him through the centuries would not
          have existed but for the attributes revealed at the close of his history. But it was for a purpose that his
          character was laid open to the world. It was to be a warning to all who, like him, should betray sacred
          trusts.... For thirty</p>
      <p>pieces of <nobr>silver—the</nobr> price of a <nobr>slave—he</nobr> sold the Lord of glory to ignominy and
          death.</p>
