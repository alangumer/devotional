    <h1>Prophecy for Pay</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers 22</strong></p>
      <p>They have abandoned the right road and wandered off to follow the old trail of Balaam, son of Beor, the man who
          had no objection to wickedness as long as he was paid for it. 2 Peter 2:15, Phillips.</p>
      <p>Balaam was once a good man and a prophet of God; but he had apostatized, and had given himself up to
          covetousness; yet he still professed to be a servant of the Most High. He was not ignorant of God’s work in
          behalf of Israel; and when the messengers announced their errand, he well knew that it was his duty to refuse
          the rewards of Balak and to dismiss the ambassadors. But he ventured to dally with temptation, and urged the
          messengers to tarry with him that night, declaring that he could give no decided answer till he had asked
          counsel of the Lord. Balaam knew that his curse could not harm Israel. God was on their side, and so long as
          they were true to Him no adverse power of earth or hell could prevail against them. But his pride was ﬂattered
          by the words of the ambassadors, “He whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.” The
          bribe of costly gifts and prospective exaltation excited his covetousness. He greedily accepted the offered
          treasures, and then, while professing strict obedience to the will of God, he tried to comply with the desires
          of Balak....</p>
      <p>The sin of covetousness, which God declares to be idolatry, had made him a timeserver, and through this one
          fault Satan gained entire control of him. It was this that caused his ruin. The tempter is ever presenting
          worldly gain and honor to entice men from the service of God. He tells them it is their overconscientiousness
          that keeps them from prosperity. Thus many are induced to venture out of the path of strict integrity. One
          wrong step makes the next easier, and they become more and more presumptuous. They will do and dare most
          terrible things when once they have given themselves to the control of avarice and a desire of power. Many
          ﬂatter themselves that they can depart from strict integrity for a time, ... and that having gained their
          object, they can change their course when they please. Such are entangling themselves in the snare of Satan,
          and it is seldom that they escape.</p>
