      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>14:22-33</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. Matthew 14:27.</p>
      <p>They [the disciples] “entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.” They had left Jesus with
          dissatisﬁed hearts.... They murmured</p>
      <p>because they had not been permitted to proclaim Him king. They blamed themselves for yielding so readily to His
          command....</p>
      <p>Unbelief was taking possession of their minds and hearts. Love of honor had blinded them.... Would Christ never
          assert His authority as king? Why did not He</p>
      <p>who possessed such power reveal Himself in His true character, and make their way less painful? Why had He not
          saved John the Baptist from a violent death? Thus the disciples reasoned until they brought upon themselves
          great spiritual darkness. They questioned, Could Jesus be an impostor, as the Pharisees asserted?</p>
      <p>The disciples had that day witnessed the wonderful works of Christ. It had seemed that heaven had come down to
          the earth. The memory of that precious, glorious day should have ﬁlled them with faith and hope. Had they, out
          of the abundance of their hearts, been conversing together in regard to these things, they would not have
          entered into temptation.... Their thoughts were stormy and</p>
      <p>unreasonable, and the Lord gave them something else to afﬂict their souls and occupy their minds. God often
          does this when men create burdens and troubles for themselves....</p>
      <p>A violent tempest had been stealing upon them, and they were unprepared for it.... They forgot their
          disaffection, their unbelief, their impatience. Everyone</p>
      <p>worked to keep the boat from sinking.... Until the fourth watch of the night they</p>
      <p>toiled at the oars. Then the weary men gave themselves up for lost. In storm and darkness the sea had taught
          them their own helplessness, and they longed for the presence of their Master.</p>
      <p>Jesus had not forgotten them.... At the moment when they believe themselves</p>
      <p>lost, a gleam of light reveals a mysterious ﬁgure approaching them upon the waters.... Their beloved Master
          turns, His voice silences their fear, “Be of good</p>
      <p>cheer; it is I; be not afraid.”</p>
