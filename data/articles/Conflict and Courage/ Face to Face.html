    <h1>Face to Face</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>33:1-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. Exodus 33:11.</p>
      <p>After the transgression of Israel in making the golden calf, Moses again goes to plead with God in behalf of
          his people.... He has learned from experience that</p>
      <p>in order to have an inﬂuence with the people he must ﬁrst have power with God. The Lord reads the sincerity and
          unselﬁsh purpose of the heart of His servant and condescends to commune with this feeble mortal, face to face,
          as a man speaks with a friend. Moses casts himself and all his burdens fully upon God and freely pours out his
          soul before Him. The Lord does not reprove His servant, but stoops to listen to his supplications....</p>
      <p>The answer comes: “My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.” But Moses does not feel that he
          can stop here. He has gained much, but he longs to come still nearer to God, to obtain a stronger assurance of
          His abiding presence. He has carried the burden of Israel; he has borne an overwhelming weight of
          responsibility; when the people sinned, he suffered keen remorse, as though he himself were guilty; and now
          there presses upon his soul a sense of the terrible results should God leave Israel to hardness and
          impenitence of heart.... Moses</p>
      <p>presses his petition with such earnestness and fervency that the answer comes: I</p>
      <p>will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by
          name.”</p>
      <p>Now, indeed, we would expect the prophet to cease pleading; but no, emboldened by his success, he ventures to
          come still nearer to God, with a holy familiarity which is almost beyond our comprehension. He now makes a
          request which no human being ever made before: “I beseech thee, show me thy glory.” What a petition to come
          from ﬁnite, mortal man! But is he repulsed? Does God reprove him for presumption? No; we hear the gracious
          words: “I will make all my goodness pass before thee.”...</p>
      <p>In the history of Moses we may see what intimate communion with God it is man’s privilege to enjoy.</p>
