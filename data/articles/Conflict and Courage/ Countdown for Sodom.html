    <h1>Countdown for Sodom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>18:16-33</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? ... That be far from
          thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: ... Shall not the Judge of all the earth
          do right? Genesis 18:23, 25.</p>
      <p>Abraham had honored God, and the Lord honored him, taking him into His counsels, and revealing to him His
          purposes. “Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?” said the Lord....</p>
      <p>And the man of faith pleaded for the inhabitants of Sodom. Once he had saved them by his sword, now he
          endeavored to save them by prayer.... With deep</p>
      <p>reverence and humility he urged his plea.... Himself a sinner, he pleaded in the</p>
      <p>sinner’s behalf. Such a spirit all who approach God should possess. Yet Abraham manifested the conﬁdence of a
          child pleading with a loved father. He came close to the heavenly Messenger, and fervently urged his
          petition.</p>
      <p>Though Lot had become a dweller in Sodom, he did not partake in the iniquity of its inhabitants. Abraham
          thought that in that populous city there must be other worshipers of the true God.... Abraham asked not once
          merely, but many times.</p>
      <p>Waxing bolder as his requests were granted, he continued until he gained the assurance that if even ten
          righteous persons could be found in it, the city would be spared.</p>
      <p>Love for perishing souls inspired Abraham’s prayer. While he loathed the sins of that corrupt city, he desired
          that the sinners might be saved. His deep interest for Sodom shows the anxiety that we should feel for the
          impenitent. We should cherish hatred of sin, but pity and love for the sinner.</p>
      <p>All around us are souls going down to ruin as hopeless, as terrible, as that which befell Sodom. Every day the
          probation of some is closing. Every hour some are passing beyond the reach of mercy. And where are the voices
          of warning and entreaty to bid the sinner ﬂee from this fearful doom? Where are the hands stretched out to
          draw him back from death? Where are those who with humility and persevering faith are pleading with God for
          him?</p>
