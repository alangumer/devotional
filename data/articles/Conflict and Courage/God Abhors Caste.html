    <h1>God Abhors Caste</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>15:21-28</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call
          upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:12, 13.</p>
      <p>“Behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son
          of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil” (Matthew 15:22, R. V.). The people of this district
          were of the old Canaanite race. They were idolaters, and were despised and hated by the Jews. To this class
          belonged the woman who now came to Jesus. She was a heathen....</p>
      <p>Christ did not immediately reply to the woman’s request. He received this representative of a despised race as
          the Jews would have done.... The woman</p>
      <p>urged her case with increased earnestness, bowing at Christ’s feet, and crying, “Lord, help me.” ...</p>
      <p>She yields at once to the divine inﬂuence of Christ, and has implicit faith in His ability to grant the favor
          she asks. She begs for the crumbs that fall from the Master’s table. If she may have the privilege of a dog,
          she is willing to be regarded as a dog. She has no national or religious prejudice or pride to inﬂuence her
          course, and she immediately acknowledges Jesus as the Redeemer, and as being able to do all that she asks of
          Him.</p>
      <p>The Saviour is satisﬁed. He has tested her faith in Him.... Turning to her with</p>
      <p>a look of pity and love, He says, “O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” From that
          hour her daughter became whole. The demon troubled her no more....</p>
      <p>In faith the woman of Phoenicia ﬂung herself against the barriers that had been piled up between Jew and
          Gentile. Against discouragement, regardless of appearances that might have led her to doubt, she trusted the
          Saviour’s love. It is thus that Christ desires us to trust in Him. The blessings of salvation are for every
          soul. Nothing but his own choice can prevent any man from becoming a partaker of the promise in Christ by the
          gospel.</p>
      <p>Caste is hateful to God. He ignores everything of this character. In His sight the souls of all men are of
          equal value.</p>
