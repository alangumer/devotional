      <p><strong>Ezra ... was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given. Ezra
          7:6.</strong></p>
      <p>More than two thousand years have passed since Ezra “prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do
          it,” yet the lapse of time has not lessened the inﬂuence of his pious example. Through the centuries the
          record of his life of consecration has inspired many with the determination “to seek the law of the Lord, and
          to do it.”</p>
      <p>Ezra’s motives were high and holy; in all that he did he was actuated by a deep love for souls. The compassion
          and tenderness that he revealed toward those who had sinned, either willfully or through ignorance, should be
          an object lesson to all who seek to bring about reforms....</p>
      <p>There is no such thing as weakening or strengthening the law of Jehovah. As it has been, so it is. It always
          has been, and always will be, holy, just, and good, complete in itself. It cannot be repealed or changed. To
          “honor” or “dishonor” it is but the speech of men....</p>
      <p>Christians should be preparing for what is soon to break upon the world as an overwhelming surprise, and this
          preparation they should make by diligently studying the word of God and striving to conform their lives to its
          precepts. The tremendous issues of eternity demand of us something besides an imaginary religion, a religion
          of words and forms, where truth is kept in the outer court....</p>
      <p>If the saints of the Old Testament bore so bright a testimony of loyalty, should not those upon whom is shining
          the accumulated light of centuries, bear a still more signal witness to the power of truth?</p>
      <p>Shall we let the example of Ezra teach us the use we should make of our knowledge of the Scriptures? The life
          of this servant of God should be an inspiration to us to serve the Lord with heart and mind and strength. We
          each have an appointed work to do, and this can be accomplished only by consecrated effort. We need ﬁrst to
          set ourselves to know the requirements of God, and then to practice them. Then we can sow seeds of truth that
          will bear fruit unto eternal life.</p>
