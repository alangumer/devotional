      <p><strong>The lips of the righteous feed many. Proverbs 10:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the prevailing iniquity, there was a line of holy men who, elevated and ennobled by communion
          with God, lived as in the companionship of heaven. They were men of massive intellect, of wonderful
          attainments. They had a great and holy <nobr>mission—to</nobr> develop a character of righteousness, to teach
          a lesson of godliness, not only to the men of their time, but for future generations. Only a few of the most
          prominent are mentioned in the Scriptures; but all through the ages God had faithful witnesses, truehearted
          worshipers.</p>
      <p>How often those who trusted the word of God, though in themselves utterly helpless, have withstood the power of
          the whole <nobr>world—Enoch,</nobr> pure in heart, holy in life, holding fast his faith in the triumph of
          righteousness against a corrupt and scofﬁng generation; Noah and his household against the men of his time,
          men of the greatest physical and mental strength and the most debased in morals; the children of Israel at the
          Red Sea, a helpless, terriﬁed multitude of slaves, against the mightiest army of the mightiest nation on the
          globe; David, a shepherd lad, having God’s promise of the throne, against Saul, the established monarch, bent
          on holding fast his power; Shadrach and his companions in the ﬁre, and Nebuchadnezzar on the throne; Daniel
          among the lions, his enemies in the high places of the kingdom; Jesus on the cross, and the Jewish priests and
          rulers forcing even the Roman governor to work their will; Paul in chains led to a criminal’s death, Nero the
          despot of a world empire.</p>
      <p>Such examples are not found in the Bible only. They abound in every record of human progress. The Vaudois and
          the Huguenots, Wycliffe and Huss, Jerome and Luther, Tyndale and Knox, Zinzendorf and Wesley, with multitudes
          of others have witnessed to the power of God’s word against human power and policy in support of evil. These
          are the world’s true nobility. This is its royal line. In this line the youth of today are called to take
          their places.</p>
