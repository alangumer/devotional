    <h1>What Made Him Great?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>11:7-15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
          notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. Matthew 11:11.</p>
      <p>What was it that made John the Baptist great? He closed his mind to the mass of tradition presented by the
          teachers of the Jewish nation, and opened it to the wisdom which comes from above.</p>
      <p>John the Baptist was not ﬁtted for his high calling as the forerunner of Christ by association with the great
          men of the nation in the schools of Jerusalem. He went out into the wilderness, where the customs and
          doctrines of men could not mold his mind, and where he could hold unobstructed communion with God.</p>
      <p>John the Baptist was a man ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost from his birth, and if there was anyone who could remain
          unaffected by the corrupting inﬂuences of the age in which he lived, it was surely he. Yet he did not venture
          to trust his strength; he separated himself from his friends and relatives, that his natural affections might
          not prove a snare to him. He would not place himself unnecessarily in the way of temptation nor where the
          luxuries or even the conveniences of life would lead him to indulge in ease or to gratify his appetite, and
          thus lessen his physical and mental strength....</p>
      <p>He subjected himself to privation and solitude in the wilderness, where he could preserve the sacred sense of
          the majesty of God by studying His great book of nature.... It was an atmosphere calculated to perfect moral
          culture and to</p>
      <p>keep the fear of the Lord continually before him. John, the forerunner of Christ, did not expose himself to
          evil conversation and the corrupting inﬂuences of the world. He feared the effect upon his conscience, that
          sin might not appear to him so exceedingly sinful. He chose rather to have his home in the wilderness, where
          his senses would not be perverted by his surroundings. Should we not learn something from this example of one
          whom Christ honored and of whom He said: “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater
          than John the Baptist”?</p>
