    <h1>“Come and See”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>1:29-51</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Philip ﬁndeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did
          write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. John 1:45.</p>
      <p>Philip called Nathanael.... If Nathanael had trusted to the rabbis for guidance,</p>
      <p>he would never have found Jesus. It was by seeing and judging for himself that he became a disciple. So in the
          case of many today whom prejudice withholds from good. How different would be the result if they would “come
          and see”! ...</p>
      <p>Like Nathanael, we need to study God’s word for ourselves, and pray for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.
          He who saw Nathanael under the ﬁg tree will see us in the secret place of prayer. Angels from the world of
          light are near to those who in humility seek for divine guidance.</p>
      <p>With the calling of John and Andrew and Simon, of Philip and Nathanael, began the foundation of the Christian
          church. John directed two of his disciples to Christ. Then one of these, Andrew, found his brother, and called
          him to the Saviour. Philip was then called, and he went in search of Nathanael. These examples should teach us
          the importance of personal effort, of making direct appeals to our kindred, friends, and neighbors....</p>
      <p>There are many who need the ministration of loving Christian hearts. Many have gone down to ruin who might have
          been saved if their neighbors, common men and women, had put forth personal effort for them. Many are waiting
          to be personally addressed. In the very family, the neighborhood, the town, where we live, there is work for
          us to do as missionaries for Christ. If we are Christians, this work will be our delight. No sooner is one
          converted than there is born within him a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found
          in Jesus. The saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart....</p>
      <p>Now that Jesus has ascended to heaven, His disciples are His representatives among men, and one of the most
          effective ways of winning souls to Him is in exemplifying His character in our daily life.... A consistent
          life, characterized by</p>
      <p>the meekness of Christ, is a power in the world.</p>
