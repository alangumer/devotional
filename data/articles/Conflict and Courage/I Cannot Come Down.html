    <h1>“I Cannot Come Down”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Nehemiah 6</strong></p>
      <p>I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come
          down to you? Nehemiah 6:3.</p>
      <p>Nehemiah was chosen by God because he was willing to cooperate with the Lord as a restorer.... When he saw
          wrong principles being acted upon, he did</p>
      <p>not stand by as an onlooker, and by his silence give consent. He did not leave the people to conclude that he
          was standing on the wrong side. He took a ﬁrm, unyielding stand for the right.</p>
      <p>Every device that the prince of darkness can suggest will be employed to induce God’s servants to form a
          confederacy with the agents of Satan.... Like</p>
      <p>Nehemiah, they should steadfastly reply, “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.” God’s workers
          may safely keep on with their work, letting their efforts refute the falsehoods that malice may coin for their
          injury. Like the builders on the walls of Jerusalem they must refuse to be diverted from their work by threats
          or mockery....</p>
      <p>As the time of the end draws near, Satan’s temptations will be brought to bear with greater power upon God’s
          workers. He will employ human agents to mock and revile those who “build the wall.” But should the builders
          come down to meet the attacks of their foes, this would but retard the work. They should endeavor to defeat
          the purposes of their adversaries, but they should not allow anything to call them from their work. Truth is
          stronger than error, and right will prevail over wrong.... In Nehemiah’s ﬁrm devotion to the work of God, and
          his equally ﬁrm</p>
      <p>reliance on God, lay the reason of the failure of his enemies to draw him into their power. The soul that is
          indolent falls an easy prey to temptation; but in the life that has a noble aim, an absorbing purpose, evil
          ﬁnds little foothold....</p>
      <p>God has provided divine assistance for all the emergencies to which our human resources are unequal. He gives
          the Holy Spirit to help in every strait, to strengthen our hope and assurance, to illuminate our minds and
          purify our hearts. He provides opportunities and opens channels of working. If His people are watching the
          indications of His providence, and are ready to <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with Him, they will see mighty
          results.</p>
