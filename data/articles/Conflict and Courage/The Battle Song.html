    <h1>The Battle Song</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Chronicles <nobr>20:22-30</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the
          beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for
          ever. 2 Chronicles 20:21.</p>
      <p>It was a singular way of going to battle against the enemy’s <nobr>army—praising</nobr> the Lord with singing,
          and exalting the God of Israel. This was their battle song. They possessed the beauty of holiness. If more
          praising of God were engaged in now, hope and courage and faith would steadily increase. And would not this
          strengthen the hands of the valiant soldiers who today are standing in defense of truth?</p>
      <p>They praised God for the victory, and four days thereafter the army returned to Jerusalem, laden with the
          spoils of their enemies, singing praise for the victory won.</p>
      <p>When we have a deeper appreciation of the mercy and loving- kindness of God, we shall praise Him, instead of
          complaining. We shall talk of the loving watchcare of the Lord, of the tender compassion of the Good Shepherd.
          The language of the heart will not be selﬁsh murmuring and repining. Praise, like a clear, ﬂowing stream, will
          come from God’s truly believing ones....</p>
      <p>Why not awake the voice of spiritual song in the days of our pilgrimage? ...</p>
      <p>We need to study God’s Word, to meditate and pray. Then we shall have spiritual eyesight to discern the inner
          courts of the celestial temple. We shall catch the notes of thanksgiving sung by the heavenly choir around the
          throne. When Zion shall arise and shine, her light will be most penetrating, and songs of praise and
          thanksgiving will be heard in the assembly of the saints. Little disappointments and difﬁculties will be lost
          sight of.</p>
      <p>The Lord is our helper.... No one ever trusted God in vain. He never</p>
      <p>disappoints those who put their dependence on Him. If we would only do the work that the Lord would have us do,
          walking in the footsteps of Jesus, our hearts would become sacred harps, every chord of which would send forth
          praise and thanksgiving to the One sent by God to take away the sin of the world.</p>
