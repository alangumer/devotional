    <h1>The Last of the Twelve</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against
          you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so
          persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Matthew 5:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>John lived to be very old. He witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the ruin of the stately temple. The
          last survivor of the disciples who had been intimately connected with the Saviour, his message had great
          inﬂuence in setting forth the fact that Jesus was the Messiah, the Redeemer of the world....</p>
      <p>The rulers of the Jews were ﬁlled with bitter hatred against John for his unwavering ﬁdelity to the cause of
          Christ. They declared that their efforts against the Christians would avail nothing so long as John’s
          testimony kept ringing in the ears of the people. In order that the miracles and teachings of Jesus might be
          forgotten, the voice of the bold witness must be silenced.</p>
      <p>John was accordingly summoned to Rome to be tried for his faith. Here before the authorities the apostle’s
          doctrines were misstated. False witnesses accused him of teaching seditious heresies.... John answered for
          himself in a clear and</p>
      <p>convincing manner.... But the more convincing his testimony, the deeper was the</p>
      <p>hatred of his opposers. The emperor Domitian was ﬁlled with rage. He could neither dispute the reasoning of
          Christ’s faithful advocate, nor match the power that attended his utterance of truth; yet he determined that
          he would silence his voice.</p>
      <p>John was cast into a caldron of boiling oil; but the Lord preserved the life of His faithful servant, even as
          He preserved the three Hebrews in the ﬁery furnace. As the words were spoken, Thus perish all who believe in
          that deceiver, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, John declared, My Master patiently submitted to all that Satan and
          his angels could devise to humiliate and torture Him. He gave His life to save the world. I am honored in
          being permitted to suffer for His sake. I am a weak, sinful man. Christ was holy, harmless, undeﬁled. He did
          no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. These words had their inﬂuence, and John was removed from the
          caldron by the very men who had cast him in.</p>
