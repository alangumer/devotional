    <h1>Wisdom for the Asking</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>3:6-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it
          shall be given him. James 1:5.</p>
      <p>The God whom we serve is no respecter of persons. He who gave to Solomon the spirit of wise discernment is
          willing to impart the same blessing to His children today.... When a burden bearer desires wisdom more than he
          desires wealth,</p>
      <p>power, or fame, he will not be disappointed. Such a one will learn from the Great Teacher not only what to do,
          but how to do it in a way that will meet with the divine approval.</p>
      <p>So long as he remains consecrated, the man whom God has endowed with discernment and ability will not manifest
          an eagerness for high position, neither will he seek to rule or control. Of necessity men must bear
          responsibilities; but instead of striving for the supremacy, he who is a true leader will pray for an
          understanding heart, to discern between good and evil.</p>
      <p>The path of men who are placed as leaders is not an easy one. But they are to see in every difﬁculty a call to
          prayer. Never are they to fail of consulting the great Source of all wisdom. Strengthened and enlightened by
          the Master Worker, they will be enabled to stand ﬁrm against unholy inﬂuences and to discern right from wrong,
          good from evil. They will approve that which God approves, and will strive earnestly against the introduction
          of wrong principles into His cause. The wisdom that Solomon desired above riches, honor, or long life, God
          gave him. His petition for a quick mind, a large heart, and a tender spirit was granted.</p>
      <p>It would be well for us carefully to study Solomon’s prayer, and to consider every point on which depended his
          receiving the rich blessings that the Lord was ready to give him.</p>
      <p>God commended Solomon’s prayer. And He will today hear and commend the prayers of those who in faith and
          humility cry to Him for aid. He will certainly answer the fervent prayer for a preparation for service. In
          answer He will say, Here I am. What wilt thou that I shall do for thee? ... He who led Solomon’s mind as he
          made this prayer will today teach His servants how to pray for what they need.</p>
