      <p><strong>1 Samuel 15</strong></p>
      <p>Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king. 1 Samuel
          15:23.</p>
      <p>Terriﬁed by the denunciation of the prophet, Saul acknowledged his guilt, which he had before stubbornly
          denied; but he still persisted in casting blame upon the people, declaring that he had sinned through fear of
          them.</p>
      <p>It was not sorrow for sin, but fear of its penalty, that actuated the king of Israel.... It was his chief
          anxiety to maintain his authority and retain the allegiance</p>
      <p>of the people.... As Samuel turned to depart, the king, in an agony of fear, laid</p>
      <p>hold of his mantle to hold him back, but it rent in his hands. Upon this, the prophet declared, “The Lord hath
          rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than
          thou.” ...</p>
      <p>Saul presumed upon his exaltation, and dishonored God by unbelief and disobedience. Though when ﬁrst called to
          the throne he was humble and <nobr>self-distrustful,</nobr> success made him <nobr>self-conﬁdent....</nobr>
          The sacriﬁcial offerings were</p>
      <p>in themselves of no value in the sight of God. They were designed to express on the part of the offerer
          penitence for sin and faith in Christ and to pledge future obedience to the law of God. But without penitence,
          faith, and an obedient heart, the offerings were worthless. When, in direct violation of God’s command, Saul
          proposed to present a sacriﬁce of that which God had devoted to destruction, open contempt was shown for the
          divine authority. The service would have been an insult to Heaven.</p>
      <p>Yet with the sin of Saul and its result before us, how many are pursuing a similar course. While they refuse to
          believe and obey some requirement of the Lord, they persevere in offering up to God their formal services of
          religion. There is no response of the Spirit of God to such service. No matter how zealous men may be in their
          observance of religious ceremonies, the Lord cannot accept them if they persist in willful violation of one of
          His commands.</p>
