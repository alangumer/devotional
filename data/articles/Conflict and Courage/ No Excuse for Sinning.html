    <h1>No Excuse for Sinning</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers <nobr>20:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account; for they made his
          spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash. Psalm 106:32, 33, R.S.V.</p>
      <p>Had Moses and Aaron been cherishing <nobr>self-esteem</nobr> or indulging a passionate spirit in the face of
          divine warning and reproof, their guilt would have been far greater. But they were not chargeable with willful
          or deliberate sin; they had been overcome by a sudden temptation, and their contrition was immediate and
          heartfelt. The Lord accepted their repentance, though because of the harm their sin might do among the people,
          He could not remit its punishment....</p>
      <p>God had forgiven the people greater transgressions, but He could not deal with sin in the leaders as in those
          who were led. He had honored Moses above every other man upon the earth.... The fact that Moses had enjoyed so
          great light and</p>
      <p>knowledge made his sin more grievous. Past faithfulness will not atone for one wrong act. The greater the light
          and privileges granted to man, the greater is his responsibility, the more aggravated his failure, and the
          heavier his punishment.</p>
      <p>Moses was not guilty of a great crime, as men would view the matter.... But</p>
      <p>if God dealt so severely with this sin in His most faithful and honored servant, He will not excuse it in
          others.... All who profess godliness are under the most</p>
      <p>sacred obligation to guard the spirit, and to exercise <nobr>self-control</nobr> under the greatest
          provocation. The burdens placed upon Moses were very great; few men will ever be so severely tried as he was;
          yet this was not allowed to excuse his sin. God has made ample provision for His people; and if they rely upon
          His strength, they will never become the sport of circumstances. The strongest temptation cannot excuse sin.
          However great the pressure brought to bear upon the soul, transgression is our own act. It is not in the power
          of earth or hell to compel anyone to do evil. Satan attacks us at our weak points, but we need not be
          overcome. However severe or unexpected the assault, God has provided help for us, and in His strength we may
          conquer.</p>
