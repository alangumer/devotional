      <p><strong>And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. Genesis
          5:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Adam’s life was one of sorrow, humility, and continual repentance. As he taught his children and grandchildren
          the fear of the Lord, he was often bitterly reproached for the sin which had resulted in so much misery to his
          posterity. When he left beautiful Eden, the thought that he must die thrilled him with horror. He looked upon
          death as a dreadful calamity.... Most bitterly did he reproach</p>
      <p>himself for his ﬁrst great transgression. He entreated pardon from God through the promised Sacriﬁce. Deeply
          had he felt the wrath of God for his crime committed in Paradise. He witnessed the general corruption which
          ﬁnally provoked God to destroy the inhabitants of the earth by a ﬂood. Though the sentence of death pronounced
          upon him by his Maker at ﬁrst appeared so terrible to him, yet after he had lived some hundreds of years, it
          looked just and merciful in God, thus to bring to an end a miserable life.</p>
      <p>As Adam witnessed the ﬁrst signs of decay in the falling leaf and in the drooping ﬂowers, he mourned more
          deeply than men now mourn over their dead. The dying ﬂowers were not so great a cause of grief, because they
          were more tender and delicate; but when the tall stately trees cast off their leaves to decay, it presented
          before him the general dissolution of beautiful nature, which God had created for the especial beneﬁt of
          man.</p>
      <p>To his children, and to their children, to the ninth generation, Adam delineated the perfections of his Eden
          home; and also his fall and its dreadful results.... He</p>
      <p>declared to them that sin would be punished, in whatever form it existed; and he entreated them to obey God,
          who would deal mercifully with them if they should love and fear Him.</p>
      <p>Adam was commanded to teach his descendants the fear of the Lord, and, by his example of humble obedience, lead
          them to highly regard the offerings which typiﬁed a Saviour to come. Adam carefully treasured what God had
          revealed to him, and handed it down by word of mouth to his children and children’s children. By this means
          the knowledge of God was preserved.</p>
