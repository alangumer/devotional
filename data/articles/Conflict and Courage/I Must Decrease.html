    <h1>“I Must Decrease”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>3:23-36</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>That is why my happiness is now complete. He must grow greater and greater and I less and less. John 3:29, 30,
          Phillips.</p>
      <p>In every stage of this earth’s history God has had His agencies to carry forward His work.... John the Baptist
          had a special work, for which he was born and to</p>
      <p>which he was <nobr>appointed—the</nobr> work of preparing the way of the Lord.</p>
      <p>When, after Christ’s ministry began, the disciples of John came to him with the complaint that all men were
          following the new Teacher, John showed how clearly he understood his relation to the Messiah, and how gladly
          he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared the way.</p>
      <p>John had been called to lead out as a reformer. Because of this, his disciples were in danger of ﬁxing their
          attention upon him ... and losing sight of the fact that he was only an instrument through which God had
          wrought. But the work of John was not sufﬁcient to lay the foundation of the Christian church. When he had
          fulﬁlled his mission, another work was to be done, which his testimony could not accomplish. His disciples did
          not understand this. When they saw Christ coming in to take the work, they were jealous and dissatisﬁed.</p>
      <p>The same dangers still exist. God calls a man to do a certain work; and when he has carried it as far as he is
          qualiﬁed to take it, the Lord brings in others, to carry it still farther. But, like John’s disciples, many
          feel that the success of the work depends on the ﬁrst laborer. Attention is ﬁxed upon the human instead of the
          divine, jealousy comes in, and the work of God is marred. The one thus unduly honored is tempted to cherish
          <nobr>self-conﬁdence.</nobr> He does not realize his dependence on God. The people are taught to rely on man
          for guidance, ... and are led away from God.</p>
      <p>The work of God is not to bear the image and superscription of man. From time to time the Lord will bring in
          different agencies, through whom His purpose can best be accomplished. Happy are they who are willing for self
          to be humbled, saying with John the Baptist, “He must increase, but I must decrease.”</p>
