    <h1>Sharing Her Morsel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>17:8-16</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake ﬁrst, and
          bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel
          of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon
          the earth. 1 Kings 17:13, 14.</p>
      <p>This woman was not an Israelite. She had never had the privileges and blessings that the chosen people of God
          had enjoyed; but she was a believer in the true God and had walked in all the light that was shining on her
          pathway. And now, when there was no safety for Elijah in the land of Israel, God sent him to this woman to ﬁnd
          an asylum in her home....</p>
      <p>In this <nobr>poverty-stricken</nobr> home the famine pressed sore, and the pitifully meager fare seemed about
          to fail. The coming of Elijah on the very day when the widow feared that she must give up the struggle to
          sustain life tested to the utmost her faith in the power of the living God to provide for her necessities. But
          even in her dire extremity she bore witness to her faith by a compliance with the request of the stranger who
          was asking her to share her last morsel with him....</p>
      <p>No greater test of faith than this could have been required. The widow had hitherto treated all strangers with
          kindness and liberality. Now, regardless of the suffering that might result to herself and child, and trusting
          in the God of Israel to supply her every need, she met this supreme test of hospitality....</p>
      <p>The widow of Zarephath shared her morsel with Elijah, and in return her life and that of her son were
          preserved. And to all who, in time of trial and want, give sympathy and assistance to others more needy, God
          has promised great blessing.</p>
      <p>That God who cared for Elijah in the time of famine, will not pass by one of His <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr>
          children. He who has numbered the hairs of their head, will care for them, and in the days of famine they will
          be satisﬁed. While the wicked are perishing all around them for want of bread, their bread and water will be
          sure.</p>
