    <h1>Still Too Many</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Judges <nobr>7:4-23</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them
          for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with
          thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. Judges 7:4.</p>
      <p>The people were led down to the waterside, expecting to make an immediate advance upon the enemy. A few hastily
          took a little water in the hand and sucked it up as they went on; but nearly all bowed upon their knees, and
          leisurely drank from the surface of the stream. Those who took of the water in their hands were but three
          hundred out of ten thousand; yet these were selected; all the rest were permitted to return to their
          homes.</p>
      <p>By the simplest means character is often tested. Those who in time of peril were intent upon supplying their
          own wants were not the men to be trusted in an emergency. The Lord has no place in His work for the indolent
          and <nobr>self-indulgent.</nobr> The men of His choice were the few who would not permit their own wants to
          delay them in the discharge of duty. The three hundred chosen men not only possessed courage and
          <nobr>self-control,</nobr> but they were men of faith. They had not deﬁled themselves with idolatry. God could
          direct them, and through them He could work deliverance for Israel. Success does not depend upon numbers. God
          can deliver by few as well as by many. He is honored not so much by the great numbers as by the character of
          those who serve Him.</p>
      <p>All who would be soldiers of the cross of Christ, must gird on the armor and prepare for conﬂict. They should
          not be intimidated by threats, or terriﬁed by dangers. They must be cautious in peril, yet ﬁrm and brave in
          facing the foe and doing battle for God. The consecration of Christ’s follower must be complete. Father,
          mother, wife, children, houses, lands, everything, must be held secondary to the work and cause of God. He
          must be willing to bear patiently, cheerfully, joyfully, whatever in God’s providence he may be called to
          suffer. His ﬁnal reward will be to share with Christ the throne of immortal glory.</p>
