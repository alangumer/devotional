    <h1>Wisest Among Men</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>4:29-34</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the
          wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of ﬁshes. 1 Kings 4:33.</p>
      <p>As the years went by and Solomon’s fame increased, he sought to honor God by adding to his mental and spiritual
          strength, and by continuing to impart to others the blessings he received. None understood better than he that
          it was through the favor of Jehovah that he had come into possession of power and wisdom and understanding,
          and that these gifts were bestowed that he might give to the world a knowledge of the King of kings.</p>
      <p>Solomon took an especial interest in natural history, but his researches were not conﬁned to any one branch of
          learning. Through a diligent study of all created things, both animate and inanimate, he gained a clear
          conception of the Creator. In the forces of nature, in the mineral and the animal world, and in every tree and
          shrub and ﬂower, he saw a revelation of God’s wisdom; and as he sought to learn more and more, his knowledge
          of God and his love for Him constantly increased.</p>
      <p>Solomon’s divinely inspired wisdom found expression in songs of praise and in many proverbs.... In the proverbs
          of Solomon are outlined principles</p>
      <p>of holy living and high endeavor, principles that are <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> and that lead to godliness,
          principles that should govern every act of life. It was the wide dissemination of these principles, and the
          recognition of God as the One to whom all praise and honor belong, that made Solomon’s early reign a time of
          moral uplift as well as of material prosperity....</p>
      <p>O that in later years Solomon had heeded these wonderful words of wisdom! O that he who had declared, “The lips
          of the wise disperse knowledge” (Proverbs 15:7), and who had himself taught the kings of the earth to render
          to the King of kings the praise they desired to give to an earthly ruler, had never with a “froward mouth,” in
          “pride and arrogancy,” taken to himself the glory due to God alone!</p>
