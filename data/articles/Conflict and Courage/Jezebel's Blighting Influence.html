    <h1>Jezebel’s Blighting Inﬂuence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings 21</strong></p>
      <p>But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom
          Jezebel his wife stirred up. 1 Kings 21:25.</p>
      <p>Ahab was weak in moral power. His union by marriage with an idolatrous woman of decided character and positive
          temperament resulted disastrously both to himself and to the nation. Unprincipled, and with no high standard
          of rightdoing, his character was easily molded by the determined spirit of Jezebel....</p>
      <p>Under the blighting inﬂuence of Ahab’s rule, Israel wandered far from the living God and corrupted their ways
          before Him.... The dark shadow of apostasy</p>
      <p>covered the whole land. Images of Baalim and Ashtoreth were everywhere to be seen. Idolatrous temples and
          consecrated groves, wherein were worshiped the works of men’s hands, were multiplied. The air was polluted
          with the smoke of the sacriﬁces offered to false gods. Hill and vale resounded with the drunken cries of a
          heathen priesthood who sacriﬁced to the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
      <p>Through the inﬂuence of Jezebel and her impious priests, the people were taught that the idol gods that had
          been set up were deities, ruling by their mystic power the elements of earth, ﬁre, and water. All the bounties
          of <nobr>heaven—the</nobr> running brooks, the streams of living water, the gentle dew, the showers of rain
          which refreshed the earth and caused the ﬁelds to bring forth <nobr>abundantly—were</nobr> ascribed to the
          favor of Baal and Ashtoreth, instead of to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. The people forgot that
          the hills and valleys, the streams and fountains, were in the hand of the living God, that He controlled the
          sun, the clouds of heaven, and all the powers of nature....</p>
      <p>In their blind folly they chose to reject God and His worship.</p>
      <p>How few realize the power of an unconsecrated woman.... God would have</p>
      <p>been with Ahab if he had walked in the counsel of heaven. But Ahab did not do this. He married a woman given to
          idolatry. Jezebel had more power over the king than God had. She led him into idolatry, and with him the
          people.</p>
