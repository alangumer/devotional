    <h1>Too Drunk to Think</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Esther <nobr>1:1-12</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>When the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded ... to bring Vashti the queen before the king with
          the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. Esther 1:10,
          11.</p>
      <p>When this command came from the king, Vashti did not carry out his orders, because she knew that wine had been
          freely used, and that Ahasuerus was under the inﬂuence of the intoxicating liquor. For her husband’s sake as
          well as her own, she decided not to leave her position at the head of the women of the court.</p>
      <p>It was when the king was not himself, when his reason was dethroned by <nobr>wine-drinking</nobr> that he sent
          for the queen, that those present at his feast, men besotted by wine, might gaze on her beauty. She acted in
          harmony with a pure conscience.</p>
      <p>Vashti refused to obey the king’s command, thinking that when he came to himself, he would commend her course
          of action. But the king had unwise advisers. They argued it would be a power given to woman that would be to
          her injury.</p>
      <p>However high their ofﬁce, men are amenable to God. The great power exercised by kings, often leads to extremes
          in exaltation of self. And the worthless vows made to enact laws which disregard the higher laws of God, lead
          to great injustice.</p>
      <p>Occasions of indulgence such as are pictured in the ﬁrst chapter of Esther, do not glorify God. But the Lord
          accomplishes His will through men who are nevertheless misleading others. If God did not stretch forth His
          restraining hand, strange presentations would be seen. But God impresses human minds to accomplish His
          purpose, even though the one used continues to follow wrong practices. And the Lord works out His plans
          through men who do not acknowledge His lessons of wisdom. In His hand is the heart of every earthly ruler, to
          turn whithersoever He will, as He turneth the waters of the river.</p>
