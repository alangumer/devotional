    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the
          faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 1 Timothy 6:10.</strong></p>
      <p>How tenderly the Saviour dealt with him who was to be His betrayer! In His teaching, Jesus dwelt upon
          principles of benevolence that struck at the very root of covetousness. He presented before Judas the heinous
          character of greed, and many a time the disciple realized that his character had been portrayed, and his sin
          pointed out; but he would not confess and forsake his unrighteousness. He was <nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr> and
          instead of resisting temptation, he continued to follow his fraudulent practices.... Jesus dealt him no sharp
          rebuke for his covetousness, but</p>
      <p>with divine patience bore with this erring man, even while giving him evidence that He read his heart as an
          open book. He presented before him the highest incentives for right doing; and in rejecting the light of
          Heaven, Judas would be without excuse.</p>
      <p>Satan is playing the game of life for every soul. He knows that practical sympathy is a test of the purity and
          unselﬁshness of the heart, and he will make every possible effort to close our hearts to the needs of
          others.... He will bring</p>
      <p>in many things to prevent the expression of love and sympathy. It is thus that he ruined Judas. Judas was
          constantly planning to beneﬁt self. In this he represents a large class of professed Christians of today.
          Therefore we need to study his case. We are as near to Christ as he was. Yet if, as with Judas, association
          with Christ does not make us one with Him, if it does not cultivate within our hearts a sincere sympathy for
          those for whom Christ gave His life, we are in the same danger as was Judas....</p>
      <p>We need to guard against the ﬁrst deviation from righteousness; for one transgression, one neglect to manifest
          the spirit of Christ, opens the way for another and still another, until the mind is overmastered by the
          principles of the enemy. If cultivated, the spirit of selﬁshness becomes a devouring passion which nothing but
          the power of Christ can subdue.</p>
