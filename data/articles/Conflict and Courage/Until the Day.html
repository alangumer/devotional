    <h1>Until the Day ...</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>6:11-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the
          ﬂood upon the world of the ungodly. 2 Peter 2:5.</p>
      <p>God warned the inhabitants of the old world of what He purposed to do in cleansing the earth of its impurity.
          But they laughed to scorn what they regarded as a superstitious prediction.</p>
      <p>Many at ﬁrst appeared to receive the warning; yet they did not turn to God with true repentance. They were
          unwilling to renounce their sins. During the time that elapsed before the coming of the Flood, their faith was
          tested, and they failed to endure the trial. Overcome by the prevailing unbelief, they ﬁnally joined their
          former associates in rejecting the solemn message. Some were deeply convicted, and would have heeded the words
          of warning; but there were so many to jest and ridicule, that they partook of the same spirit, ... and were
          soon among the boldest and most deﬁant scoffers; for none are so reckless and go to such lengths in sin as do
          those who have once had light but have resisted the convicting Spirit of God.</p>
      <p>They continued their festivities and their gluttonous feasts; they ate and drank, planted and builded, laying
          their plans in reference to advantages they hoped to gain in the future; and they went to greater lengths in
          wickedness, and in deﬁant disregard of God’s requirements, to testify that they had no fear of the Inﬁnite
          One....</p>
      <p>Had the antediluvians believed the warning, and repented of their evil deeds, the Lord would have turned aside
          His wrath, as He afterward did from Nineveh. But by their obstinate resistance to the reproofs of conscience
          and the warnings of God’s prophet, that generation ﬁlled up the measure of their iniquity, and became ripe for
          destruction.</p>
      <p>The Lord has sent us, by His ambassadors, messages of warning, declaring that the end of all things is at hand.
          Some will listen to these warnings, but by the vast majority they will be disregarded.</p>
      <p>Thus will it be when Christ comes. Farmers, merchants, lawyers, tradesmen, will be wholly engrossed in
          business, and upon them the day of the Lord will come as a snare.</p>
