      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>25:29-34</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Thus Esau despised his birthright. Genesis 25:34.</p>
      <p>Esau had no love for devotion, no inclination to a religious life. The requirements that accompanied the
          spiritual birthright were an unwelcome and even hateful restraint to him. The law of God, which was the
          condition of the divine covenant with Abraham, was regarded by Esau as a yoke of bondage. Bent on
          <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> he desired nothing so much as liberty to do as he pleased. To him power and
          riches, feasting and reveling, were happiness. He gloried in the unrestrained freedom of his wild, roving
          life.</p>
      <p>There are very many who are like Esau. He represents a class who have a special, valuable blessing within their
          <nobr>reach,—the</nobr> immortal inheritance, life that is as enduring as the life of God, the Creator of the
          universe, happiness immeasurable, and an eternal weight of <nobr>glory,—but</nobr> who have so long indulged
          their appetites, passions, and inclinations, that their power to discern and appreciate the value of eternal
          things is weakened.</p>
      <p>Esau had a special, strong desire for a particular article of food, and he had so long gratiﬁed self that he
          did not feel the necessity of turning from the tempting, coveted dish. He thought upon it, making no special
          effort to restrain his appetite, until the power of appetite ... controlled him, and he imagined that he would
          suffer great inconvenience, and even death, if he could not have that particular dish. The more he thought
          upon it, the more his desire strengthened, until his birthright, which was sacred, lost its value and its
          sacredness.</p>
      <p>Esau passed the crisis of his life without knowing it. What he regarded as a matter worthy of scarcely a
          thought was the act which revealed the prevailing traits of his character. It showed his choice, showed his
          true estimate of that which was sacred and which should have been sacredly cherished. He sold his birthright
          for a small indulgence to meet his present wants, and this determined the after course of his life.</p>
      <p>Esau represents those who have not tasted of the privileges which are theirs, purchased for them at inﬁnite
          cost, but have sold their birthright for some gratiﬁcation of appetite, or for the love of gain.</p>
