    <h1>God’s Plan for Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who
          shall turn it back? Isaiah 14:27.</strong></p>
      <p>Each actor in history stands in his lot and place; for God’s great work after His own plan will be carried out
          by men who have prepared themselves to ﬁll positions for good or evil. In opposition to righteousness, men
          become instruments of unrighteousness. But they are not forced to take this course of action. They need not
          become instruments of unrighteousness, any more than Cain needed to....</p>
      <p>Men of all characters, righteous and unrighteous, will stand in their several positions in God’s plan. With the
          characters they have formed, they will act their part in the fulﬁllment of history. In a crisis, just at the
          right moment, they will stand in the places they have prepared themselves to ﬁll. Believers and unbelievers
          will fall into line as witnesses to conﬁrm truth that they themselves do not comprehend. All will cooperate in
          accomplishing the purposes of God, just as did Annas, Caiaphas, Pilate, and Herod. In putting Christ to death,
          the priests thought they were carrying out their own purposes, but unconsciously and unintentionally they were
          fulﬁlling the purpose of God.</p>
      <p>God looks into the tiny seed that He Himself has formed, and sees wrapped within it the beautiful ﬂower, the
          shrub, or the lofty, <nobr>wide-spreading</nobr> tree. So does He see the possibilities in every human being.
          We are here for a purpose. God has given us His plan for our life, and He desires us to reach the highest
          standard of development....</p>
      <p>He desires the youth to cultivate every power of their being, and to bring every faculty into active
          exercise.... Let them look to Christ as the pattern after which</p>
      <p>they are to be fashioned. The holy ambition that He revealed in His life they are to <nobr>cherish—an</nobr>
          ambition to make the world better for their having lived in it. This is the work to which they are
          called.</p>
      <p>You want now to ... so relate yourself to society and to life that you may answer the purpose of God in your
          creation.</p>
