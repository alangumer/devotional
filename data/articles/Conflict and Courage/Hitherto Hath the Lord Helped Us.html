    <h1>“Hitherto Hath the Lord Helped Us”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him,
          sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. Psalm 105:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The dealings of God with His people should be often repeated. How frequently were the waymarks set up by the
          Lord in His dealings with ancient Israel! Lest they should forget the history of the past, He commanded Moses
          to frame these events into song, that parents might teach them to their children. They were to gather up
          memorials and to lay them up in sight. Special pains were taken to preserve them, that when the children
          should inquire concerning these things, the whole story might be repeated. Thus the providential dealings and
          the marked goodness and mercy of God in His care and deliverance of His people were kept in mind. We are
          exhorted to “call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great ﬁght
          of afﬂictions” (Hebrews 10:32). For His people in this generation the Lord has wrought as a
          <nobr>wonder-working</nobr> God....</p>
      <p>We need often to recount God’s goodness and to praise Him for His wonderful works.</p>
      <p>Let us not cast away our conﬁdence, but have ﬁrm assurance, ﬁrmer than ever before. “Hitherto hath the Lord
          helped us,” and He will help us to the end (1 Samuel 7:12). Let us look to the monumental pillars, reminders
          of what the Lord has done to comfort us and to save us from the hand of the destroyer. Let us keep fresh in
          our memory all the tender mercies that God has shown <nobr>us—the</nobr> tears He has wiped away, the pains He
          has soothed, the anxieties removed, the fears dispelled, the wants supplied, the blessings
          <nobr>bestowed—thus</nobr> strengthening ourselves for all that is before us through the remainder of our
          pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>We cannot but look forward to new perplexities in the coming conﬂict, but we may look on what is past as well
          as on what is to come, and say, “Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.” “As thy days, so shall thy strength be”
          (Deuteronomy 33:25). The trial will not exceed the strength that shall be given us to bear it. Then let us
          take up our work just where we ﬁnd it, believing that whatever may come, strength proportionate to the trial
          will be given.</p>
