    <h1>The Highest Honor</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>14:3-12</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to
          destroy both soul and body in hell. Matthew 10:28.</p>
      <p>To many minds a deep mystery surrounds the fate of John the Baptist. They question why he should have been left
          to languish and die in prison. The mystery of this dark providence our human vision cannot penetrate; but it
          can never shake our conﬁdence in God when we remember that John was but a sharer in the sufferings of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>Jesus did not interpose to deliver His servant. He knew that John would bear the test. Gladly would the Saviour
          have come to John, to brighten the dungeon gloom with His own presence. But He was not to place Himself in the
          hands of enemies and imperil His own mission. Gladly would He have delivered His faithful servant. But for the
          sake of thousands who in after years must pass from prison to death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom.
          As the followers of Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or perish by the sword, the rack, or the fagot, ...
          what a stay to their hearts would be the thought that John the Baptist, to whose faithfulness Christ Himself
          had borne witness, had passed through a similar experience!</p>
      <p>Satan was permitted to cut short the earthly life of God’s messenger; but that life which “is hid with Christ
          in God,” the destroyer could not reach. Colossians 3:3. He exulted that he had brought sorrow upon Christ, but
          he had failed of conquering John. Death itself only placed him forever beyond the power of temptation....</p>
      <p>God never leads His children otherwise than they would choose to be led, if they could see the end from the
          beginning, and discern the glory of the purpose which they are fulﬁlling as coworkers with Him. Not Enoch, who
          was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who ascended in a chariot of ﬁre, was greater or more honored than John
          the Baptist, who perished alone in the dungeon. “Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
          believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake” (Philippians 1:29). And of all the gifts that Heaven can
          bestow upon men, fellowship with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty trust and the highest
          honor.</p>
