    <h1>Shut Away with God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into
          prison, that ye may be tried; ... be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
          Revelation 2:10.</strong></p>
      <p>By the emperor’s decree John was banished to the Isle of Patmos, condemned “for the word of God, and for the
          testimony of Jesus Christ” (Revelation 1:9). Here, his enemies thought, his inﬂuence would no longer be felt,
          and he must ﬁnally die of hardship and distress.</p>
      <p>Patmos, a barren, rocky island in the Aegean Sea, had been chosen by the Roman government as a place of
          banishment for criminals; but to the servant of God this gloomy abode became the gate of heaven. Here, shut
          away from the busy scenes of life, and from the active labors of former years, he had the companionship of God
          and Christ and the heavenly angels, and from them he received instruction for the church for all future
          time.... Among the cliffs and</p>
      <p>rocks of Patmos, John held communion with his Maker. He reviewed his past life, and at thought of the blessings
          he had received, peace ﬁlled his heart....</p>
      <p>In his isolated home John was able to study more closely than ever before the manifestations of divine power as
          recorded in the book of nature and in the pages of inspiration.... In former years his eyes had been greeted
          by the sight of</p>
      <p><nobr>forest-covered</nobr> hills, green valleys, and fruitful plains; and in the beauties of nature it had
          ever been his delight to trace the wisdom and skill of the Creator. He was now surrounded by scenes that to
          many would appear gloomy and uninteresting; but to John it was otherwise. While his surroundings might be
          desolate and barren, the blue heavens that bent above him were as bright and beautiful as the skies above his
          loved Jerusalem. In the wild, rugged rocks, in the mysteries of the deep, in the glories of the ﬁrmament, he
          read important lessons. All bore the message of God’s power and glory....</p>
      <p>By the rocks he was reminded of Christ, the Rock of his strength, in whose shelter he could hide without fear.
          From the exiled apostle on rocky Patmos there went up the most ardent longing of soul after God, the most
          fervent prayers.</p>
