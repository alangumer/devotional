      <p><strong>John <nobr>21:15-19</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? John 21:17.</p>
      <p>This <nobr>heart-searching</nobr> question was necessary in the case of Peter, and it is necessary in our case.
          The work of restoration can never be thorough unless the roots of evil are reached. Again and again the shoots
          have been clipped, while the root of bitterness has been left to spring up and deﬁle many; but the very depth
          of the hidden evil must be reached....</p>
      <p>When, the third time, Christ said to Peter, “Lovest thou me?” the probe reached the soul center.
          <nobr>Self-judged,</nobr> Peter fell upon the Rock, saying, “Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that
          I love thee.”</p>
      <p>This is the work before every soul who has dishonored God, and grieved the heart of Christ, by a denial of
          truth and righteousness. If the tempted soul endures the trying process, and self does not awake to life to
          feel hurt and abused under the test, that probing knife reveals that the soul is indeed dead to self, but
          alive unto God.</p>
      <p>Some assert that if a soul stumbles and falls, he can never regain his position; but the case before us
          contradicts this.... In committing to his stewardship the</p>
      <p>souls for whom He had given His life, Christ gave to Peter the strongest evidence of His conﬁdence in his
          restoration. And he was commissioned to feed not only the sheep, but the <nobr>lambs—a</nobr> broader and more
          delicate work than had hitherto been appointed him.</p>
      <p>Peter was now humble enough to understand the words of Christ, and without further questioning, the once
          restless, boastful, <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr> disciple became subdued and contrite. He followed his Lord
          <nobr>indeed—the</nobr> Lord he had denied. The thought that Christ had not denied and rejected him was to
          Peter a light and comfort and blessing. He felt that he could be cruciﬁed from choice, but it must be with his
          head downward. And he who was so close a partaker of Christ’s sufferings will also be a partaker of His glory
          when He shall “sit upon the throne of his glory.”</p>
