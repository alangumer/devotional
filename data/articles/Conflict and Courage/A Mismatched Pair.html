    <h1>A Mismatched Pair</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>25:2-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Proverbs
          31:30.</p>
      <p>In the character of Abigail, the wife of Nabal, we have an illustration of womanhood after the order of Christ;
          while her husband illustrates what a man may become who yields himself to the control of Satan.</p>
      <p>When David was a fugitive from the face of Saul, he had camped near the possessions of Nabal, and had protected
          the ﬂocks and the shepherds of this man.... In a time of need, David sent messengers to Nabal with a
          courteous</p>
      <p>message, asking for food for himself and his men, and Nabal answered with insolence, returning evil for good,
          and refusing to share his abundance with his neighbors. No message could have been more respectful than that
          which David sent to this man, but Nabal accused David and his men falsely in order to justify himself in his
          selﬁshness, and represented David and his followers as runaway slaves. When the messenger returned with this
          insolent taunt, David’s indignation was aroused, and he determined to have speedy revenge. One of the young
          men in the employ of Nabal, fearing that evil results would follow Nabal’s insolence, came and stated the case
          to Nabal’s wife, knowing that she had a different spirit from her husband, and was a woman of great
          discretion....</p>
      <p>Abigail saw that something must be done to avert the result of Nabal’s fault, and that she must take the
          responsibility of acting immediately without the counsel of her husband. She knew that it would be useless to
          speak to him, for he would only receive her proposition with abuse and contempt. He would remind her that he
          was the lord of his household, that she was his wife, and therefore in subjection to him, and must do as he
          should dictate....</p>
      <p>Without his consent, she gathered together such stores as she thought best to conciliate the wrath of David;
          for she knew he was determined to avenge himself for the insult he had received .... Abigail’s course in this
          matter was one that God</p>
      <p>approved, and the circumstance revealed in her a noble spirit and character.</p>
