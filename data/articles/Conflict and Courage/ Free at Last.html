      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>12:29-42</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness. Psalm 105:43.</p>
      <p>With sandaled feet, and staff in hand, the people of Israel had stood, hushed, awed, yet expectant, awaiting
          the royal mandate that should bid them go forth. Before the morning broke, they were on their way.... That day
          completed the</p>
      <p>history revealed to Abraham in prophetic vision centuries before: “Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that
          is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afﬂict them four hundred years; and also that nation, whom
          they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance” (Genesis 15:13,
          14).</p>
      <p>In bringing forth Israel from Egypt, the Lord again manifested His power and His mercy. His wonderful works in
          their deliverance from bondage and His dealings with them in their travels through the wilderness were not for
          their beneﬁt alone. These were to be as an object lesson to the surrounding nations. The Lord revealed Himself
          as a God above all human authority and greatness. The signs and wonders He wrought in behalf of His people
          showed His power over nature and over the greatest of those who worshiped nature.</p>
      <p>God went through the proud land of Egypt as He will go through the earth in the last days. With ﬁre and
          tempest, earthquake and death, the great I AM redeemed His people. He took them out of the land of bondage. He
          led them through the “great and terrible wilderness, wherein were ﬁery serpents, and scorpions, and drought”
          (Deuteronomy 8:15). He brought them forth water out of “the rock of ﬂint,” and fed them with “the corn of
          heaven” (Psalm 78:24). “For,” said Moses, “the Lord’s portion is his people: Jacob is the lot of his
          inheritance. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he
          instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, ﬂuttereth over her
          young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and
          there was no strange God with him” (Deuteronomy <nobr>32:9-12).</nobr> Thus He brought them unto Himself, that
          they might dwell as under the shadow of the Most High.</p>
