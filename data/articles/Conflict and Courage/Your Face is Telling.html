    <h1>Your Face is Telling</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>4:3-7</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt
          thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. Genesis 4:6, 7.</p>
      <p>The Lord saw the wrath of Cain. He saw the falling of his countenance. Thus is revealed how closely the Lord
          marks every action, all the intents and purposes, yes, even the expression of the countenance. This, though
          man may say nothing, expresses his refusal to do the way and will of God.</p>
      <p>Mark the words of the Lord....This question may be addressed to every young</p>
      <p>man and young woman who, like Cain, reveal their passion ... when acting out the promptings of Satan, which are
          in direct opposition to the requirements of God.</p>
      <p>If you choose to throw off the sacred, restraining inﬂuence of the truth, Satan will lead you captive at his
          will. You will be in danger of giving scope to your appetites and passions, giving loose rein to lusts, to
          evil and abominable desires. Instead of bearing in your countenance a calm serenity under trial and afﬂiction,
          like faithful Enoch, having your face radiant with hope and that peace which passeth understanding, you will
          stamp your countenance with carnal thoughts, with lustful desires. You will bear the impress of the satanic
          instead of the divine.</p>
      <p>Many children and youth have their characters imprinted on their countenances. Their life’s history they carry
          in the features of the face.... If</p>
      <p>Christ is the abiding principle in the heart, you may read purity, reﬁnement, peace, and love in the features.
          In other countenances, an evil character hangs out the sign; selﬁshness, cunning, deceit, falsehood, enmity,
          and jealousy are expressed there. How difﬁcult it is for truth to impress the hearts and countenances of such
          characters! ...</p>
      <p>All spiritual culture Christ has provided for His children. If Jesus is abiding in the soul, the heart is ﬁlled
          with the holy graces of His Spirit, which makes itself manifest in the transforming of the features. If you
          would have beauty and loveliness of character, the divine law must be written upon the heart and carried out
          in the life.</p>
