    <h1>Sold Out</h1>

      <p><strong>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold
          to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Matthew 6:24.</strong></p>
      <p>So gradual was Solomon’s apostasy that before he was aware of it, he had wandered far from God. Almost
          imperceptibly he began to trust less and less in divine guidance and blessing, and to put conﬁdence in his own
          strength....</p>
      <p>Engrossed in an overmastering desire to surpass other nations in outward display, the king overlooked the need
          of acquiring beauty and perfection of character. In seeking to glorify himself before the world, he sold his
          honor and integrity....</p>
      <p>The conscientious, considerate spirit that had marked his dealings with the people during the early part of his
          reign, was now changed. From the wisest and most merciful of rulers, he degenerated into a tyrant. Once the
          compassionate, <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> guardian of the people, he became oppressive and despotic.</p>
      <p>Men who have the use of money are to learn a lesson from the history of Solomon. Those who have a competence
          are in continual danger of thinking that money and position will ensure them respect, and they need not be so
          particular. But <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> is but a bubble. By misusing the talents given him, Solomon
          apostatized from God. When God gives men prosperity, they are to beware of following the imaginations of their
          own hearts, lest they endanger the simplicity of their faith and deteriorate in religious experience.</p>
      <p>The lesson for us to learn from the history of this perverted life is the necessity of continual dependence
          upon the counsels of God; to carefully watch the tendency of our course, and to reform every habit calculated
          to draw us from God. It teaches us that great caution, watchfulness, and prayer are needed to keep undeﬁled
          the simplicity and purity of our faith. If we would rise to the highest moral excellence, and attain to the
          perfection of religious character, what discrimination should be used in the formation of friendships, and the
          choice of a companion for life!</p>
