    <h1>Always the Same</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>41:1-43</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
          Proverbs 22:29.</p>
      <p>From the dungeon Joseph was exalted to be ruler over all the land of Egypt. It was a position of high honor,
          yet it was beset with difﬁculty and peril. One cannot stand upon a lofty height without danger. As the tempest
          leaves unharmed the lowly ﬂower of the valley, while it uproots the stately tree upon the mountaintop, so
          those who have maintained their integrity in humble life may be dragged down to the pit by the temptations
          that assail worldly success and honor. But Joseph’s character bore the test alike of adversity and prosperity.
          The same ﬁdelity to God was manifest when he stood in the palace of the Pharaohs as when in a prisoner’s cell.
          He was still a stranger in a heathen land, separated from his kindred, the worshipers of God; but he fully
          believed that the divine hand had directed his steps, and in constant reliance upon God he faithfully
          discharged the duties of his position. Through Joseph the attention of the king and great men of Egypt was
          directed to the true God; and though they adhered to their idolatry, they learned to respect the principles
          revealed in the life and character of the worshiper of Jehovah.</p>
      <p>How was Joseph enabled to make such a record of ﬁrmness of character, uprightness, and <nobr>wisdom?—In</nobr>
          his early years he had consulted duty rather than inclination; and the integrity, the simple trust, the noble
          nature, of the youth bore fruit in the deeds of the man. A pure and simple life had favored the vigorous
          development of both physical and intellectual powers. Communion with God through His works and the
          contemplation of the grand truths entrusted to the inheritors of faith had elevated and ennobled his spiritual
          nature, broadening and strengthening the mind as no other study could do. Faithful attention to duty in every
          station, from the lowliest to the most exalted, had been training every power for its highest service. He who
          lives in accordance with the Creator’s will is securing to himself the truest and noblest development of
          character.</p>
