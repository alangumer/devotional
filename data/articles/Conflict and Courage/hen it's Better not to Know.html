    <h1>When it’s Better not to Know</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>3:6-24</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. Ecclesiastes 1:17.</p>
      <p>Adam and Eve both ate of the fruit, and obtained a knowledge which, had they obeyed God, they would never have
          <nobr>had,—an</nobr> experience in disobedience and disloyalty to <nobr>God,—the</nobr> knowledge that they
          were naked. The garment of innocence, a covering from God, which surrounded them, departed; and they supplied
          the place of this heavenly garment by sewing together <nobr>ﬁg-leaves</nobr> for aprons.</p>
      <p>This is the covering that the transgressors of the law of God have used since the days of Adam and Eve’s
          disobedience.... The <nobr>ﬁg-leaves</nobr> represent the arguments</p>
      <p>used to cover disobedience....</p>
      <p>But the nakedness of the sinner is not covered....</p>
      <p>Had Adam and Eve never disobeyed their Creator, had they remained in the path of perfect rectitude, they could
          have known and understood God. But when they listened to the voice of the tempter, and sinned against God, the
          light of the garments of heavenly innocence departed from them; and in parting with the garments of innocence,
          they drew about them the dark robes of ignorance of God. The clear and perfect light that had hitherto
          surrounded them had lightened everything they approached; but deprived of that heavenly light, the posterity
          of Adam could no longer trace the character of God in His created works.</p>
      <p>If Adam and Eve had never touched the forbidden tree, the Lord would have imparted to them
          <nobr>knowledge,—knowledge</nobr> upon which rested no curse of sin, knowledge that would have brought them
          everlasting joy....</p>
      <p>Age after age, the curiosity of men has led them to seek for the tree of knowledge; and often they think they
          are plucking fruit most essential, when, like Solomon’s research, they ﬁnd it altogether vanity and
          nothingness in comparison with that science of true holiness which will open to them the gates of the city of
          God. The human ambition has been seeking for that kind of knowledge that will bring to them glory and
          <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> and supremacy. Thus Adam and Eve were worked upon by Satan.</p>
