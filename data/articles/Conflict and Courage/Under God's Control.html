      <p><strong>Dnaiel 2</strong></p>
      <p>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: and he
          changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise,
          and knowledge to them that know understanding. Daniel 2:20, 21.</p>
      <p>Behold the Jewish captive, calm and <nobr>self-possessed,</nobr> in the presence of the monarch of the world’s
          most powerful empire. In his ﬁrst words he disclaimed honor for himself and exalted God as the source of all
          wisdom. To the anxious inquiry of the king, “Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen,
          and the interpretation thereof?” he replied: “The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
          astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king; but there is a God in heaven that revealeth
          secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.” ...</p>
      <p>In the annals of human history, the growth of nations, the rise and fall of empires, appear as if dependent on
          the will and prowess of man; the shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined by his power,
          ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the curtain is drawn aside, and we behold, above, behind, and
          through all the play and counterplay of human interest and power and passions, the agencies of the
          <nobr>All-merciful</nobr> One, silently, patiently working out the counsels of His own will....</p>
      <p>In the history of nations the student of God’s word may behold the literal fulﬁllment of divine prophecy.
          Babylon, shattered and broken at last, passed away because in prosperity its rulers had regarded themselves as
          independent of God, and had ascribed the glory of their kingdom to human achievement.... The</p>
      <p>kingdoms that followed were even more base and corrupt; and these sank lower and still lower in the scale of
          moral worth.</p>
      <p>The power exercised by every ruler on the earth is <nobr>Heaven-imparted;</nobr> and upon his use of the power
          thus bestowed, his success depends.... To recognize the</p>
      <p>outworking of these principles in the manifestation of His power who “removeth kings, and setteth up
          <nobr>kings”—this</nobr> is to understand the philosophy of history.</p>
