    <h1>Why Elisha?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>19:19-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than
          me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me is not worthy of me. Matthew
          10:37, 38.</p>
      <p>As Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a successor, passed the ﬁeld in which Elisha was plowing, he cast upon
          the young man’s shoulders the mantle of consecration.... To him it was the signal that God had called him to
          be the</p>
      <p>successor of Elijah.... Elisha must count the <nobr>cost—decide</nobr> for himself to accept or</p>
      <p>reject the call. If his desires clung to his home and its advantages, he was at liberty to remain there. But
          Elisha understood the meaning of the call.... Not for any</p>
      <p>worldly advantage would he forgo the opportunity of becoming God’s messenger, or sacriﬁce the privilege of
          association with His servant.... Without hesitation he</p>
      <p>left a home where he was beloved, to attend the prophet in his uncertain life. Because they are not connected
          with some directly religious work, many</p>
      <p>feel that their lives are useless, that they are doing nothing for the advancement of God’s kingdom.... Because
          they can serve only in little things, they think</p>
      <p>themselves justiﬁed in doing nothing. In this they err. A man may be in the active service of God while engaged
          in the ordinary, everyday <nobr>duties—while</nobr> felling trees, clearing the ground, or following the plow.
          The mother who trains her children for Christ is as truly working for God as is the minister in the
          pulpit.</p>
      <p>Many long for special talent with which to do a wonderful work, while the duties lying close at hand, the
          performance of which would make the life fragrant, are lost sight of.... Success depends not so much on talent
          as on energy</p>
      <p>and willingness. It is not the possession of splendid talents that enables us to render acceptable service, but
          the conscientious performance of daily duties, the contented spirit, the unaffected, sincere interest in the
          welfare of others. In the humblest lot true excellence may be found. The commonest tasks, wrought with loving
          faithfulness, are beautiful in God’s sight.</p>
