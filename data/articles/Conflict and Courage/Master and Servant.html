    <h1>Master and Servant</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Philemon</strong></p>
      <p>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee,
          both in the ﬂesh, and in the Lord? Philemon 16.</p>
      <p>Among those who gave their hearts to God through the labors of Paul in Rome was Onesimus, a pagan slave who had
          wronged his master, Philemon, a Christian believer in Colosse, and had escaped to Rome. In the kindness of his
          heart, Paul sought to relieve the poverty and distress of the wretched fugitive and then endeavored to shed
          the light of truth into his darkened mind. Onesimus listened to the words of life, confessed his sins, and was
          converted to the faith of Christ....</p>
      <p>Paul ... counseled him to return without delay to Philemon, beg his forgiveness, and plan for the future. The
          apostle promised to hold himself responsible for the sum of which Philemon had been robbed.... It was a severe
          test for this servant</p>
      <p>thus to deliver himself up to the master he had wronged; but he had been truly converted, and he did not turn
          aside from this duty....</p>
      <p>Paul’s letter to Philemon shows the inﬂuence of the gospel upon the relation between master and servant.
          Slaveholding was an established institution throughout the Roman Empire, and both masters and slaves were
          found in most of the churches for which Paul labored....</p>
      <p>It was not the apostle’s work to overturn arbitrarily or suddenly the established order of society. To attempt
          this would be to prevent the success of the gospel. But he taught principles which struck at the very
          foundation of slavery and which, if carried into effect, would surely undermine the whole system.... When
          converted,</p>
      <p>the slave became a member of the body of Christ, and as such was to be loved and treated as a brother, a fellow
          heir with his master to the blessings of God and the privileges of the gospel. On the other hand, servants
          were to perform their duties, “not with eyeservice, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the
          will of God from the heart” (Ephesians 6:6).</p>
      <p>Christianity makes a strong bond of union between master and slave, king and subject.... They have been washed
          in the same blood, quickened by the same</p>
      <p>Spirit; and they are made one in Christ Jesus.</p>
