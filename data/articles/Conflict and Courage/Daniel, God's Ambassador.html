      <p>Then the presidents and princes sought to ﬁnd occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could
          ﬁnd none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
          Daniel 6:4.</p>
      <p>Daniel, the prime minister of the greatest of earthly kingdoms, was at the same time a prophet of God,
          receiving the light of heavenly inspiration. A man of like passions as ourselves, the pen of inspiration
          describes him as without fault. His business transactions, when subjected to the closest scrutiny of his
          enemies, were found to be without one ﬂaw. He was an example of what every businessman may become when his
          heart is converted and consecrated, and when his motives are right in the sight of God....</p>
      <p>Unwavering in his allegiance to God, unyielding in his mastery of self, Daniel, by his noble dignity and
          unswerving integrity, while yet a young man, won the “favor and tender love” of the heathen ofﬁcer in whose
          charge he had been placed.... He rose speedily to the position of prime minister of the kingdom</p>
      <p>of Babylon. Through the reign of successive monarchs, the downfall of the nation, and the establishment of
          another world empire, such were his wisdom and statesmanship, so perfect his tact, his courtesy, his genuine
          goodness of heart, his ﬁdelity to principle, that even his enemies were forced to the confession that “they
          could ﬁnd none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful.”</p>
      <p>Honored by men with the responsibilities of state and with the secrets of kingdoms bearing universal sway,
          Daniel was honored by God as His ambassador, and was given many revelations of the mysteries of ages to come.
          His wonderful prophecies, as recorded by him in chapters 7 to 12 of the book bearing his name, were not fully
          understood even by the prophet himself; but before his life labors closed, he was given the blessed assurance
          that “at the end of the <nobr>days”—in</nobr> the closing period of this world’s <nobr>history—he</nobr> would
          again be permitted to stand in his lot and place....</p>
      <p>We may, like Daniel and his fellows, live for that which is true and noble and enduring. And learning in this
          life the principles of the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, ... we may be prepared at His coming to enter with
          Him into its possession.</p>
