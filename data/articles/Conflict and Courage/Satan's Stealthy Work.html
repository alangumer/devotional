    <h1>Satan’s Stealthy Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Samuel 11</strong></p>
      <p>For our ﬁght is not against any physical enemy: it is against organizations and powers that are spiritual. We
          are up against the unseen power that controls this dark world, and spiritual agents from the very headquarters
          of evil. Ephesians 6:12, Phillips.</p>
      <p>The Bible has little to say in praise of men. Little space is given to recounting the virtues of even the best
          men who have ever lived. This silence is not without purpose; it is not without a lesson. All the good
          qualities that men possess are the gift of God; their good deeds are performed by the grace of God through
          Christ. Since they owe all to God the glory of whatever they are or do belongs to Him alone; they are but
          instruments in His hands. More than <nobr>this—as</nobr> all the lessons of Bible history
          <nobr>teach—it</nobr> is a perilous thing to praise or exalt men; for if one comes to lose sight of his entire
          dependence on God, and to trust to his own strength, he is sure to fall....</p>
      <p>It is impossible for us in our own strength to maintain the conﬂict; and whatever diverts the mind from God,
          whatever leads to <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> or to <nobr>self-dependence,</nobr> is surely preparing the way
          for our overthrow. The tenor of the Bible is to inculcate distrust of human power and to encourage trust in
          divine power.</p>
      <p>It was the spirit of <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> and <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> that prepared the way for
          David’s fall. Flattery and the subtle allurements of power and luxury were not without effect upon him.
          Intercourse with surrounding nations also exerted an inﬂuence for evil. According to the customs prevailing
          among Eastern rulers, crimes not to be tolerated in subjects were uncondemned in the king; the monarch was not
          under obligation to exercise the same <nobr>self-restraint</nobr> as the subject. All this tended to lessen
          David’s sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. And instead of relying in humility upon the power of
          Jehovah, he began to trust to his own wisdom and might.</p>
      <p>As soon as Satan can separate the soul from God, the only Source of strength, he will seek to arouse the unholy
          desires of man’s carnal nature. The work of the enemy is not abrupt; it is not, at the outset, sudden and
          startling; it is a secret undermining of the strongholds of principle.</p>
