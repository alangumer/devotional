    <h1>Linked with Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. Psalm
          34:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The experience of Philip, directed by an angel from heaven to go to the place where he met one seeking for
          truth; of Cornelius, visited by an angel with a message from God; of Peter, in prison and condemned to death,
          led by an angel forth to <nobr>safety—all</nobr> show the closeness of the connection between heaven and
          earth.</p>
      <p>To the worker for God the record of these angel visits should bring strength and courage. Today, as verily as
          in the days of the apostles, heavenly messengers are passing through the length and breadth of the land,
          seeking to comfort the sorrowing, to protect the impenitent, to win the hearts of men to Christ. We cannot see
          them personally; nevertheless they are with us, guiding, directing, protecting.</p>
      <p>Heaven is brought near to earth by that mystic ladder, the base of which is ﬁrmly planted on the earth, while
          the topmost round reaches the throne of the Inﬁnite. Angels are constantly ascending and descending this
          ladder of shining brightness, bearing the prayers of the needy and distressed to the Father above, and
          bringing blessing and hope, courage and help, to the children of men. These angels of light create a heavenly
          atmosphere about the soul, lifting us toward the unseen and the eternal. We cannot behold their forms with our
          natural sight....</p>
      <p>The spiritual ear alone can hear the harmony of heavenly voices....</p>
      <p>God commissions His angels to save His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them from “the pestilence that
          walketh in darkness” and “the destruction that wasteth at noonday.”</p>
      <p>Again and again have angels talked with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places of
          security. Again and again have the encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits of the faithful
          and, carrying their minds above the things of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white robes, the
          crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers will receive when they surround the great white
          throne.</p>
