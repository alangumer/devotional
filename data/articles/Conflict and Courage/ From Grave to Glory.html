    <h1>From Grave to Glory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy <nobr>3:23-28;</nobr> Deuteronomy 34</strong></p>
      <p>I besought the Lord at that time, saying, ... I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond
          Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear
          me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it sufﬁce thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. Deuteronomy
          <nobr>3:23-26.</nobr></p>
      <p>Never, till exempliﬁed in the sacriﬁce of Christ, were the justice and the love of God more strikingly
          displayed than in His dealings with Moses. God shut Moses out of Canaan, to teach a lesson which should never
          be <nobr>forgotten—that</nobr> He requires exact obedience, and that men are to beware of taking to themselves
          the glory which is due to their Maker. He could not grant the prayer of Moses that he might share the
          inheritance of Israel, but He did not forget or forsake His servant. The God of heaven understood the
          suffering that Moses had endured; He had noted every act of faithful service through those long years of
          conﬂict and trial. On the top of Pisgah, God called Moses to an inheritance inﬁnitely more glorious than the
          earthly Canaan.</p>
      <p>Upon the mount of transﬁguration Moses was present with Elijah, who had been translated. They were sent as
          bearers of light and glory from the Father to His Son. And thus the prayer of Moses, uttered so many centuries
          before, was at last fulﬁlled. He stood upon the “goodly mountain,” within the heritage of his people....</p>
      <p>Moses was a type of Christ.... God saw ﬁt to discipline Moses in the school</p>
      <p>of afﬂiction and poverty before he could be prepared to lead the hosts of Israel to the earthly Canaan. The
          Israel of God, journeying to the heavenly Canaan, have a Captain who needed no human teaching to prepare Him
          for His mission as a divine leader; yet He was made perfect through sufferings; and “in that he himself hath
          suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted” (Hebrews 2:10, 18). Our Redeemer
          manifested no human weakness or imperfection; yet He died to obtain for us an entrance into the Promised
          Land.</p>
      <p>“And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, ... but Christ as a son over his own house; whose
          house we are, if we hold fast the conﬁdence and the rejoicing of the hope ﬁrm unto the end” (Hebrews 3:5,
          6).</p>
