    <h1>Rudeness Rebuked</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>2:23-25</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.
          Leviticus 19:32.</p>
      <p>Elisha was a man of mild and kindly spirit; but that he could also be stern is shown by his course when, on the
          way to Bethel, he was mocked by ungodly youth who had come out of the city. These youth had heard of Elijah’s
          ascension, and they made this solemn event the subject of their jeers, saying to Elisha, “Go up, thou bald
          head; go up, thou bald head.” At the sound of their mocking words the prophet turned back, and under the
          inspiration of the Almighty he pronounced a curse upon them. The awful judgment that followed was of God.
          “There came forth two <nobr>she-bears</nobr> out of the wood, and tare forty and two” of them (2 Kings 2:23,
          24).</p>
      <p>Had Elisha allowed the mockery to pass unnoticed, he would have continued to be ridiculed and reviled by the
          rabble, and his mission to instruct and save in a time of grave national peril might have been defeated. This
          one instance of terrible severity was sufﬁcient to command respect throughout his life. For ﬁfty years he went
          in and out of the gate of Bethel, and to and fro in the land, from city to city, passing through crowds of
          idle, rude, dissolute youth; but none mocked him or made light of his qualiﬁcations as the prophet of the Most
          High....</p>
      <p>Reverence, in which the youth who mocked Elisha were so lacking, is a grace that should be carefully cherished.
          Every child should be taught to show true reverence for God. Never should His name be spoken lightly or
          thoughtlessly. Angels, as they speak it, veil their faces. With what reverence should we, who are fallen and
          sinful, take it upon our lips!....</p>
      <p>Courtesy, also, is one of the graces of the Spirit and should be cultivated by all. It has power to soften
          natures which without it would grow hard and rough. Those who profess to be followers of Christ, and are at
          the same time rough, unkind, and uncourteous, have not learned of Jesus. Their sincerity may not be doubted,
          their uprightness may not be questioned; but sincerity and uprightness will not atone for a lack of kindness
          and courtesy.</p>
