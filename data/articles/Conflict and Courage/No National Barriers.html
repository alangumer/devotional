      <p><strong>Acts 10</strong></p>
      <p>Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one
          Simon, whose surname is Peter: he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall
          tell thee what thou oughtest to do. Acts <nobr>10:4-6.</nobr></p>
      <p>The explicitness of these directions, in which was named even the occupation of the man with whom Peter was
          staying, shows that Heaven is acquainted with the history and business of men in every station of life. God is
          familiar with the experience and work of the humble laborer, as well as with that of the king upon his
          throne.</p>
      <p>My heart is made very tender as I read of the interest manifested by the Lord in Cornelius. Cornelius was a man
          in high position, an ofﬁcer in the Roman army, but he was walking in strict accordance with all the light he
          had received. The Lord sent a special message from heaven to him, and by another message directed Peter to
          visit him and give him light.</p>
      <p>Cornelius was gladly obedient to the vision.</p>
      <p>Thus was the gospel brought to those who had been strangers and foreigners, making them fellow citizens with
          the saints, and members of the household of God. The conversion of Cornelius and his household was but the
          ﬁrst fruits of a harvest to be gathered in. From this household a <nobr>wide-spread</nobr> work of grace was
          carried on in that heathen city.</p>
      <p>Today God is seeking for souls among the high as well as the lowly. There are many like Cornelius, men whom the
          Lord desires to connect with His work in the world. Their sympathies are with the Lord’s people, but the ties
          that bind them to the world hold them ﬁrmly. It requires moral courage for them to take their position for
          Christ. Special efforts should be made for these souls, who are in so great danger, because of their
          responsibilities and associations.</p>
      <p>From the story of Cornelius we learn that God will lead every one who is willing to be led. He led Cornelius.
          He drew out His servant’s heart in prayer. He prepared him to receive the light of His truth, and he chose to
          enlighten the mind of Cornelius through the agency of one who had already received light from above.</p>
