    <h1>To Caesar</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts 25</strong></p>
      <p>I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged.... For if</p>
      <p>I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not do die: but if there be none of
          these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. Acts 25:10,
          11.</p>
      <p>Once more, because of hatred born of bigotry and <nobr>self-righteousness,</nobr> a servant of God was driven
          to turn for protection to the heathen. It was this same hatred that forced the prophet Elijah to ﬂee for
          succor to the widow of Sarepta; and that forced the heralds of the gospel to turn from the Jews to proclaim
          their message to the Gentiles. And this hatred the people of God living in this age have yet to meet. Among
          many of the professing followers of Christ there is the same pride, formalism, and selﬁshness, the same spirit
          of oppression, that held so large a place in the Jewish heart.... In the great crisis through which they are
          soon to pass, the</p>
      <p>faithful servants of God will encounter the same hardness of heart, the same cruel determination, the same
          unyielding hatred.</p>
      <p>All who in that evil day would fearlessly serve God according to the dictates of conscience, will need courage,
          ﬁrmness, and a knowledge of God and His word; for those who are true to God will be persecuted, their motives
          will be impugned, their best efforts misinterpreted, and their names cast out as evil. Satan will work with
          all his deceptive power to inﬂuence the heart and becloud the understanding, to make evil appear good, and
          good evil....</p>
      <p>God desires His people to prepare for the <nobr>soon-coming</nobr> crisis.... Those only</p>
      <p>who have brought their lives into conformity to the divine standard, will stand ﬁrm at that time of test and
          trial. When secular rulers unite with ministers of religion to dictate in matters of conscience, then it will
          be seen who really fear and serve God. When the darkness is deepest, the light of a godlike character will
          shine the brightest.... And while the enemies of truth are on every side, watching the Lord’s</p>
      <p>servants for evil, God will watch over them for good. He will be to them as the shadow of a great rock in a
          weary land.</p>
