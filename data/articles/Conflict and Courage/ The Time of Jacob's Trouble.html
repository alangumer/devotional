    <h1>The Time of Jacob’s Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>32:24-30</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be
          saved out of it. Jeremiah 30:7.</p>
      <p>When Christ shall cease His work as mediator in man’s behalf, then this time of trouble will begin. Then the
          case of every soul will have been decided, and there will be no atoning blood to cleanse from sin....</p>
      <p>Then the restraining Spirit of God is withdrawn from the earth. As Jacob was threatened with death by his angry
          brother, so the people of God will be in peril from the wicked who are seeking to destroy them. And as the
          patriarch wrestled all night for deliverance from the hand of Esau, so the righteous will cry to God day and
          night for deliverance from the enemies that surround them....</p>
      <p>When in his distress Jacob laid hold of the Angel, and made supplication with tears, the heavenly Messenger, in
          order to try his faith, also reminded him of his sin, and endeavored to escape from him. But Jacob would not
          be turned away. He had learned that God is merciful, and he cast himself upon His mercy. He pointed back to
          his repentance for his sin, and pleaded for deliverance. As he reviewed his life, he was driven almost to
          despair; but he held fast the Angel, and with earnest, agonizing cries urged his petition until he
          prevailed.</p>
      <p>Such will be the experience of God’s people in their ﬁnal struggle with the powers of evil. God will test their
          faith, their perseverance, their conﬁdence in His power to deliver them. Satan will endeavor to terrify them
          with the thought that their cases are hopeless; that their sins have been too great to receive pardon. They
          will have a deep sense of their shortcomings, and as they review their lives their hopes will sink. But
          remembering the greatness of God’s mercy, and their own sincere repentance, they will plead His promises made
          through Christ to helpless, repenting sinners. Their faith will not fail because their prayers are not
          immediately answered. They will lay hold of the strength of God, as Jacob laid hold of the Angel, and the
          language of their souls will be, “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.”</p>
