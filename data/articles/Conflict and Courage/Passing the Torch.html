      <p><strong>2 Timothy <nobr>4:1-5;</nobr> 2 Timothy <nobr>3:1-5</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his
          appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with
          all longsuffering and doctrine. 2 Timothy 4:1, 2.</p>
      <p>In this his last letter to Timothy, Paul held up before the younger worker a high ideal, pointing out the
          duties devolving on him as a minister of Christ.... Paul bids</p>
      <p>him preach the word, not the sayings and customs of men; to be ready to witness for God whenever opportunity
          should present <nobr>itself—before</nobr> large congregations and private circles, by the way and at the
          ﬁreside, to friends and to enemies, whether in safety or exposed to hardship and peril, reproach and
          loss.</p>
      <p>Fearing that Timothy’s mild, yielding disposition might lead him to shun an essential part of his work, Paul
          exhorted him to be faithful in reproving sin and even to rebuke with sharpness those who were guilty of gross
          evils. Yet he was to do this “with all <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> and doctrine.” He was to reveal the
          patience and love of Christ....</p>
      <p>To hate and reprove sin, and at the same time to show pity and tenderness for the sinner, is a difﬁcult
          attainment. The more earnest our own efforts to attain to holiness of heart and life, the more acute will be
          our perception of sin and the more decided our disapproval of any deviation from the right. We must guard
          against undue severity toward the wrongdoer, but we must also be careful not to lose sight of the exceeding
          sinfulness of sin. There is need of showing Christlike patience and love for the erring one, but there is also
          danger of showing so great toleration for his error that he will look upon himself as undeserving of
          reproof....</p>
      <p>With the growing contempt for God’s law there is an increasing distaste for religion, an increase of pride,
          love of pleasure, disobedience to parents, and <nobr>self-indulgence;</nobr> and thoughtful minds everywhere
          are anxiously inquiring. What can be done to correct these alarming evils? The answer is found in Paul’s
          exhortation to Timothy, “Preach the word.” In the Bible are found the only safe principles of action. It is a
          transcript of the will of God, an expression of divine wisdom.</p>
