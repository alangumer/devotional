    <h1>Abused Talents</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. And
          Zillah, she also bare <nobr>Tubal-cain,</nobr> an instructor of every artiﬁcer in brass and iron. Genesis
          4:21, 22.</strong></p>
      <p>There perished in the Flood greater inventions of art and human skill than the world knows of today. The arts
          destroyed were more than the boasted arts of today....</p>
      <p>Looking upon the world, God saw that the intellect He had given man was perverted, that the imagination of his
          heart was evil and that continually. God had given these men knowledge. He had given them valuable ideas, that
          they might carry out His plan. But the Lord saw that those whom He designed should possess wisdom, tact, and
          judgment, were using every quality of the mind to glorify self. By the waters of the Flood, He blotted this
          <nobr>long-lived</nobr> race from the earth, and with them perished the knowledge they had used only for evil.
          When the earth was repeopled, the Lord trusted His wisdom more sparingly to men, giving them only the ability
          they would need in carrying out His great plan.</p>
      <p>The world today takes much satisfaction in talking of the progress of the age. But in this God does not
          delight. It may be said of the men of this time, as of those before the ﬂood, They have sought out many
          inventions. In the antediluvian world there were many wonderful works of art and science. These descendants of
          Adam, fresh from the hand of God, possessed capabilities and powers that we never now look upon.</p>
      <p>Those who lived before the ﬂood were only a few steps from God, the Creator of the world and its inhabitants.
          The long life and large intellect given to these men might have been used in God’s service. But their
          intellectual strength, that mighty power, was perverted to dishonor God....</p>
      <p>When men separate from God, they place themselves under the control of Satan. Talents have been given to men
          that they may be used in God’s service....</p>
      <p>There is only one safe way for any man, and that is the way of obedience to a “Thus saith the Lord.”</p>
