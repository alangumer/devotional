    <h1>Simon’s Change of Heart</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>7:36-50</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou
          condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. Romans 2:1.</p>
      <p>Simon the host had been inﬂuenced by the criticism of Judas upon Mary’s gift, and he was surprised at the
          conduct of Jesus. His Pharisaic pride was offended. He knew that many of his guests were looking upon Christ
          with distrust and displeasure. Simon said in his heart, “This Man, if He were a prophet, would have known who
          and what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him: for she is a sinner.”</p>
      <p>By curing Simon of leprosy, Christ had saved him from a living death. But now Simon questioned whether the
          Saviour were a prophet.... Jesus knows</p>
      <p>nothing of this woman who is so free in her demonstrations, he thought, or He would not allow her to touch
          Him....</p>
      <p>As did Nathan with David, Christ concealed His home thrust under the veil of a parable. He threw upon His host
          the burden of pronouncing sentence upon himself. Simon had led into sin the woman he now despised. She had
          been deeply wronged by him.... But Simon felt himself more righteous than Mary, and Jesus</p>
      <p>desired him to see how great his guilt really was. He would show him that his sin was greater than hers, as
          much greater as a debt of ﬁve hundred pence exceeds a debt of ﬁfty pence....</p>
      <p>Simon’s coldness and neglect toward the Saviour showed how little he appreciated the mercy he had received. He
          had thought he honored Jesus by inviting Him to his house. But he now saw himself as he really was.... His
          religion</p>
      <p>had been a robe of Pharisaism.... While Mary was a sinner pardoned, he was a</p>
      <p>sinner unpardoned. The rigid rule of justice he had desired to enforce against her condemned him.</p>
      <p>Simon was touched by the kindness of Jesus is not openly rebuking him before the guests. He had not been
          treated as he desired Mary to be treated....</p>
      <p>Stern denunciation would have hardened Simon against repentance, but patient admonition convinced him of his
          error. He saw the magnitude of the debt which he owed his Lord. His pride was humbled, he repented, and the
          proud Pharisee became a lowly, <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> disciple.</p>
