    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the
          earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. Isaiah 26:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Our God is a God of mercy. With <nobr>long-sufferance</nobr> and tender compassion He deals with the
          transgressors of His law.... But there is a point beyond which</p>
      <p>divine patience is exhausted, and the judgments of God are sure to follow. The Lord bears long with men, and
          with cities, mercifully giving warnings to save them from divine wrath; but a time will come when pleadings
          for mercy will no longer be heard....</p>
      <p>The time is at hand when there will be sorrow in the world that no human balm can heal. The Spirit of God is
          being withdrawn. Disasters by sea and by land follow one another in quick succession. How frequently we hear
          of earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by ﬁre and ﬂood, with great loss of life and property! Apparently
          these calamities are capricious outbreaks of disorganized, unregulated forces of nature, wholly beyond the
          control of man; but in them all, God’s purpose may be read. They are among the agencies by which He seeks to
          arouse men and women to a sense of their danger.</p>
      <p>God’s messengers in the great cities are not to become discouraged over the wickedness, the injustice, the
          depravity, which they are called upon to face while endeavoring to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation....
          In every city, ﬁlled though</p>
      <p>it may be with violence and crime, there are many who with proper teaching may learn to become followers of
          Jesus.... God’s message for the inhabitants of earth</p>
      <p>today is, “Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh” (Matthew 24:44).... We
          are standing on the threshold of the crisis of the</p>
      <p>ages....</p>
      <p>The storm of God’s wrath is gathering; and those only will stand who respond to the invitations of mercy, as
          did the inhabitants of Nineveh under the preaching of Jonah, and become sanctiﬁed through obedience to the
          laws of the divine Ruler. The righteous alone shall be hid with Christ in God till the desolation be
          overpast.</p>
