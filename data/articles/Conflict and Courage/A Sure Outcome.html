    <h1>A Sure Outcome</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>17:38-58</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then said David to the Philistine, ... I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies
          of Israel, whom thou hast deﬁed. 1 Samuel 17:45.</p>
      <p>Goliath railed upon David and cursed him by his gods. He felt that it was an insult upon his dignity to have a
          mere stripling, without so much as an armor, come to meet him.... David did not become irritated because he
          was looked upon</p>
      <p>as so inferior, neither did he tremble at his terrible threats, but replied: “Thou</p>
      <p>comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of
          hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast deﬁed.”</p>
      <p>This speech, given in a clear, musical voice, rang out on the air, and was distinctly heard by the listening
          thousands marshaled for war. The anger of Goliath was roused to the very highest heat. In his rage he pushed
          up the helmet that protected his forehead and rushed forward to wreak vengeance upon his opponent. The son of
          Jesse was preparing for his foe. “And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to
          meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. And David put his hand in his
          bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in the forehead, that the stone sunk into
          his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.”</p>
      <p>Amazement spread along the lines of the two armies. They had been conﬁdent that David would be slain; but when
          the stone went whizzing through the air, straight to the mark, they saw the mighty warrior tremble, and reach
          forth his hands, as if he were struck with sudden blindness. The giant reeled, and staggered, and like a
          smitten oak, fell to the ground. David did not wait an instant. He sprang upon the prostrate form of the
          Philistine, and with both hands laid hold of Goliath’s heavy sword. A moment before, the giant had boasted
          that with it he would sever the youth’s head from his shoulders and give his body to the fowls of the air. Now
          it was lifted in the air, and then the head of the boaster rolled from his trunk, and a shout of exultation
          went up from the camp of Israel.</p>
