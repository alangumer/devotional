    <h1>True Riches</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. Proverbs
          10:22.</strong></p>
      <p>Many envied the popularity and abundant glory of Solomon, thinking that of all men he must be the most happy.
          But amid all that glory of artiﬁcial display the man envied is the one to be most pitied. His countenance is
          dark with despair. All the splendor about him is but to him mockery of the distress and anguish of his
          thoughts as he reviews his misspent life in seeking for happiness through indulgence and selﬁsh gratiﬁcation
          of every desire.</p>
      <p>In the midst of prosperity lurks danger. Throughout the ages, riches and honor have ever been attended with
          peril to humility and spirituality. It is not the empty cup that we have difﬁculty in carrying; it is the cup
          full to the brim that must be carefully balanced. Afﬂiction and adversity may cause sorrow, but it is
          prosperity that is most dangerous to spiritual life. Unless the human subject is in constant submission to the
          will of God, unless he is sanctiﬁed by the truth, prosperity will surely arouse the natural inclination to
          presumption.</p>
      <p>In the valley of humiliation, where men depend on God to teach them and to guide their every step, there is
          comparative safety. But the men who stand, as it were, on a lofty pinnacle, and who, because of their
          position, are supposed to possess great <nobr>wisdom—these</nobr> are in gravest peril. Unless such men make
          God their dependence, they will surely fall.</p>
      <p>Whenever pride and ambition are indulged, the life is marred, for pride, feeling no need, closes the heart
          against the inﬁnite blessings of Heaven. He who makes <nobr>self-gloriﬁcation</nobr> his aim will ﬁnd himself
          destitute of the grace of God, through whose efﬁciency the truest riches and the most satisfying joys are won.
          But he who gives all and does all for Christ will know the fulﬁllment of the promise, “The blessing of the
          Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it.”</p>
      <p>All the sins and excesses of Solomon can be traced to his great mistake in ceasing to rely upon God for wisdom,
          and to walk in humility before Him.</p>
