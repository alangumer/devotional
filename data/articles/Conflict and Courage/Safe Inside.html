      <p><strong>Genesis 7</strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me
          in this generation. Genesis 7:1.</p>
      <p>Noah had faithfully followed the instructions which he had received from God. The ark was ﬁnished in every part
          as the Lord had directed, and was stored with food for man and beast. And now the servant of God made his last
          solemn appeal to the people. With an agony of desire that words cannot express, he entreated them to seek a
          refuge while it might be found. Again they rejected his words, and raised their voices in jest and scofﬁng.
          Suddenly a silence fell upon the mocking throng. Beasts of every description, the ﬁercest as well as the most
          gentle, were seen coming from mountain and forest and quietly making their way toward the ark. A noise as of a
          rushing wind was heard, and lo, birds were ﬂocking from all directions, their numbers darkening the heavens,
          and in perfect order they passed to the ark. Animals obeyed the command of God, while men were
          disobedient.</p>
      <p>When they saw the beasts come from the forests to the door of the ark, and Noah take them in, they had so long
          resisted, so long denied the message that God had given them, that ... conscience had become
          unimpressible.</p>
      <p>Mercy had ceased its pleadings for the guilty race. The beasts of the ﬁeld and the birds of the air had entered
          the place of refuge. Noah and his household were within the ark, “and the Lord shut him in.” ... The massive
          door, which it was impossible for those within to close, was slowly swung to its place by unseen hands. Noah
          was shut in, and the rejecters of God’s mercy were shut out. The seal of Heaven was on that door; God had shut
          it, and God alone could open it. So when Christ shall cease His intercession for guilty men, before His coming
          in the clouds of heaven, the door of mercy will be shut. Then divine grace will no longer restrain the wicked,
          and Satan will have full control of those who have rejected mercy. They will endeavor to destroy God’s people;
          but as Noah was shut into the ark, so the righteous will be shielded by divine power.</p>
