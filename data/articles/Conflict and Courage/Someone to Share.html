      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>2:18-25</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. Genesis 2:18.</p>
      <p>After the creation of Adam every living creature was brought before him to receive its name; he saw that to
          each had been given a companion, but among them “there was not found an help meet for him.” Among all the
          creatures that God had made on the earth, there was not one equal to man. And God said, “It is not good that
          the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.” Man was not made to dwell in solitude; he was
          to be a social being. Without companionship the beautiful scenes and delightful employments of Eden would have
          failed to yield perfect happiness. Even communion with angels could not have satisﬁed his desire for sympathy
          and companionship. There was none of the same nature to love and to be loved.</p>
      <p>God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided “an help meet for <nobr>him”—a</nobr> helper corresponding to
          <nobr>him—one</nobr> who was ﬁtted to be his companion, and who could be one with him in love and sympathy.
          Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him as the
          head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and
          protected by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and ﬂesh of his ﬂesh, she was his second self; showing the
          close union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this relation. “For no man ever yet hated his
          own ﬂesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it” (Ephesians 5:29). “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
          mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one” (Genesis 2:24).</p>
      <p>God celebrated the ﬁrst marriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of the universe.
          “Marriage is honorable” (Hebrews 13:4); it was one of the ﬁrst gifts of God to man, and it is one of the two
          institutions that, after the Fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise. When the divine
          principles are recognized and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and
          happiness of the race, it provides for man’s social needs, it elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the
          moral nature.</p>
