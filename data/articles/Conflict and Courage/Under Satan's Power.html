    <h1>Under Satan’s Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>16:21-25</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest
          not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. Matthew 16:23.</p>
      <p>Satan is ever intruding himself between the soul of man and God.... This</p>
      <p>lesson in regard to Peter needs to be studied carefully.</p>
      <p>Peter did not desire to see the cross in the work of Christ. The impression which his words would make was
          directly opposed to that which Christ desired to make on the minds of His followers, and the Saviour was moved
          to utter one of the sternest rebukes that ever fell from His lips....</p>
      <p>Satan was trying to discourage Jesus, and turn Him from His mission; and Peter, in his blind love, was giving
          voice to the temptation. The prince of evil was the author of the thought. His instigation was behind that
          impulsive appeal.... He</p>
      <p>was seeking to ﬁx Peter’s gaze upon the earthly glory, that he might not behold the cross to which Jesus
          desired to turn his eyes. And through Peter, Satan was again pressing the temptation upon Jesus. But the
          Saviour heeded it not; His thought was for His disciple. Satan had interposed between Peter and his Master,
          that the heart of the disciple might not be touched at the vision of Christ’s humiliation for him. The words
          of Christ were spoken, not to Peter, but to the one who was trying to separate him from his Redeemer. “Get
          thee behind Me, Satan.” No longer interpose between Me and My erring servant. Let Me come face to face with
          Peter, that I may reveal to him the mystery of My love.</p>
      <p>It was to Peter a bitter lesson, and one which he learned but slowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay
          through agony and humiliation. The disciple shrank from fellowship with his Lord in suffering. But in the heat
          of the furnace ﬁre he was to learn its blessing. Long afterward, when his active form was bowed with the
          burden of years and labors, he wrote, “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the ﬁery trial which is to try
          you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s
          sufferings; that, when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy” (1 Peter 4:12,
          13).</p>
