    <h1>God’s Secrets</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>28:3-25</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. Acts 1:7.</p>
      <p>The witch of Endor had made agreement with Satan to follow his directions in all things; and he would perform
          wonders and miracles for her, and would reveal to her the most secret things, if she would yield herself
          unreservedly to be controlled by his Satanic majesty. This she had done.</p>
      <p>By the prediction of Saul’s doom, given through the woman of Endor, Satan planned to ensnare the people of
          Israel. He hoped that they would be inspired with conﬁdence in the sorceress, and would be led to consult her.
          Thus they would turn from God as their counselor and would place themselves under the guidance of Satan. The
          lure by which spiritualism attracts the multitudes is its pretended power to draw aside the veil from the
          future and reveal to men what God has hidden. God has in His word opened before us the great events of the
          <nobr>future—all</nobr> that it is essential for us to <nobr>know—and</nobr> He has given us a safe guide for
          our feet amid all its perils; but it is Satan’s purpose to destroy men’s conﬁdence in God, to make them
          dissatisﬁed with their condition in life, and to lead them to seek a knowledge of what God has wisely veiled
          from them, and to despise what He has revealed in His Holy Word.</p>
      <p>There are many who become restless when they cannot know the deﬁnite outcome of affairs. They cannot endure
          uncertainty, and in their impatience they refuse to wait to see the salvation of God. Apprehended evils drive
          them nearly distracted. They give way to their rebellious feelings, and run hither and thither in passionate
          grief, seeking intelligence concerning that which has not been revealed. If they would but trust in God, and
          watch unto prayer, they would ﬁnd divine consolation. Their spirit would be calmed by communion with God. The
          weary and the <nobr>heavy-laden</nobr> would ﬁnd rest unto their souls if they would only go to Jesus; but
          when they neglect the means that God has ordained for their comfort, and resort to other sources, hoping to
          learn what God has withheld, they commit the error of Saul, and thereby gain only a knowledge of evil.</p>
