    <h1>Nothing Too Costly</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>7:36-50</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For the love of Christ constraineth us. 2 Corinthians 5:14.</p>
      <p>Christ delighted in the earnest desire of Mary to do the will of her Lord. He accepted the wealth of pure
          affection which His disciples did not, would not, understand. The desire that Mary had to do this service for
          her Lord was of more value to Christ than all the precious ointment in the world, because it expressed her
          appreciation of the world’s Redeemer. It was the love of Christ that constrained her. The matchless excellence
          of the character of Christ ﬁlled her soul. That ointment was a symbol of the heart of the giver. It was the
          outward demonstration of a love fed by heavenly streams until it overﬂowed.</p>
      <p>The work of Mary was just the lesson the disciples needed to show them that the expression of their love for
          Him would be pleasing to Christ. He had been everything to them, and they did not realize that soon they would
          be deprived of His presence, that soon they could offer Him no token of their gratitude for His great love.
          The loneliness of Christ, separated from the heavenly courts, living the life of humanity, was never
          understood or appreciated by the disciples as it should have been....</p>
      <p>Their afterknowledge gave them a true sense of the many things they might have done for Jesus expressive of the
          love and gratitude of their hearts.... When</p>
      <p>Jesus was no longer with them, ... they began to see how they might have shown Him attentions that would have
          brought gladness to His heart. They no longer cast blame upon Mary, but upon themselves. Oh, if they could
          have taken back their censuring, their presenting the poor as more worthy of the gift than was Christ! They
          felt the reproof keenly as they took from the cross the bruised body of their Lord.</p>
      <p>The same want is evident in our world today. But few appreciate all that Christ is to them. If they did, the
          great love of Mary would be expressed, the anointing would be freely bestowed. The expensive ointment would
          not be called a waste. Nothing would be thought too costly to give for Christ, no <nobr>self-denial</nobr> or
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> too great to be endured for His sake.</p>
