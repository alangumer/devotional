    <h1>Duty or Desire</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers 22</strong></p>
      <p>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. Proverbs 1:25.</p>
      <p>In the night season the angel of God came to Balaam with the message, “Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
          not curse the people: for they are blessed.” ...</p>
      <p>A second time Balaam was tested. In response to the solicitations of the ambassadors he professed great
          conscientiousness and integrity, assuring them that no amount of gold and silver could induce him to go
          contrary to the will of God. But he longed to comply with the king’s request; and although the will of God had
          already been deﬁnitely made known to him, he urged the messengers to tarry, that he might further inquire of
          God; as though the Inﬁnite One were a man, to be persuaded.</p>
      <p>In the night season the Lord appeared to Balaam and said, “If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with
          them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.” Thus far the Lord would permit Balaam
          to follow his own will, because he was determined upon it. He did not seek to do the will of God, but chose
          his own course, and then endeavored to secure the sanction of the Lord.</p>
      <p>There are thousands at the present day who are pursuing a similar course. They would have no difﬁculty in
          understanding their duty if it were in harmony with their inclinations. It is plainly set before them in the
          Bible or is clearly indicated by circumstances and reason. But because these evidences are contrary to their
          desires and inclinations they frequently set them aside and presume to go to God to learn their duty. With
          great apparent conscientiousness they pray long and earnestly for light. But God will not be triﬂed with. He
          often permits such persons to follow their own desires and to suffer the result.... When one clearly</p>
      <p>sees a duty, let him not presume to go to God with the prayer that he may be excused from performing it. He
          should rather, with a humble, submissive spirit, ask for divine strength and wisdom to meet its claims.</p>
