      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>9:1-2</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>There was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he. 1 Samuel 9:2.</p>
      <p>The personal qualities of the future monarch were such as to gratify that pride of heart which prompted the
          desire for a king.... Of noble and digniﬁed bearing,</p>
      <p>in the prime of life, comely and tall, he appeared like one born to command. Yet with these external
          attractions, Saul was destitute of those higher qualities that constitute true wisdom. He had not in youth
          learned to control his rash, impetuous passions; he had never felt the renewing power of divine grace.</p>
      <p>The Lord would not leave Saul to be placed in a position of trust without divine enlightenment. He was to have
          a new calling, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him. The effect was that he was changed into a new man.
          The Lord gave Saul a new spirit, other thoughts, other aims and desires than he had previously had. This
          enlightenment, with the spiritual knowledge of God, placing him on vantage ground, was to bind his will to the
          will of Jehovah....</p>
      <p>Saul had a mind and inﬂuence capable of governing a kingdom, if his powers had been submitted to the control of
          God, but the very endowments that qualiﬁed him for doing good could be used by Satan, when surrendered to his
          power, and would enable him to exert widespread inﬂuence for evil. He could be more sternly vindictive, more
          injurious and determined in prosecuting his unholy designs, than could others, because of the superior powers
          of mind and heart that had been given him of God.</p>
      <p>Should he trust to his own strength and judgment, Saul would move impulsively, and would commit grave errors.
          But if he would remain humble, seeking constantly to be guided by divine wisdom, and advancing as the
          providence of God opened the way, he would be enabled to discharge the duties of his high position with
          success and honor. Under the inﬂuence of divine grace, every good quality would be gaining strength, while
          evil traits would as steadily lose their power. This is the work which the Lord proposes to do for all who
          consecrate themselves to Him.</p>
