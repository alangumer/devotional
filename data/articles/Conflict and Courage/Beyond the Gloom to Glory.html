      <p><strong>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 2 Timothy
          3:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In the experience of the apostle John under persecution, there is a lesson of wonderful strength and comfort
          for the Christian. God does not prevent the plottings of wicked men, but He causes their devices to work for
          good to those who in trial and conﬂict maintain their faith and loyalty....</p>
      <p>It is the work of faith to rest in God in the darkest hour, to feel, however sorely tried and
          <nobr>tempest-tossed,</nobr> that our Father is at the helm. The eye of faith alone can look beyond the things
          of time to estimate aright the worth of the eternal riches.</p>
      <p>Jesus does not present to His followers the hope of attaining earthly glory and riches, of living a life free
          from trial. Instead He calls upon them to follow Him in the path of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and reproach. He
          who came to redeem the world was opposed by the united forces of evil.... So it will be with all who will live
          godly in</p>
      <p>Christ Jesus. Persecution and reproach await all who are imbued with the Spirit of Christ....</p>
      <p>In all ages Satan has persecuted the people of God. He has tortured them and put them to death, but in dying
          they became conquerors. They bore witness to the power of One mightier than Satan. Wicked men may torture and
          kill the body, but they cannot touch the life that is hid with Christ in God. They can incarcerate men and
          women in prison walls, but they cannot bind the spirit.</p>
      <p>Through trial and persecution the <nobr>glory—the</nobr><nobr>character—of</nobr> God is revealed in His chosen
          ones.... They follow Christ through sore conﬂicts; they endure</p>
      <p><nobr>self-denial</nobr> and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of sin,
          and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ’s sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom
          to the glory, saying, “I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
          the glory which shall be revealed in us” (Romans 8:18).</p>
