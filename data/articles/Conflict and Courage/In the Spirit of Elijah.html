    <h1>In the Spirit of Elijah</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>1:5-23</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He will go out before God in the spirit and power of <nobr>Elijah—to</nobr> reconcile fathers and children, and
          bring back the disobedient to the wisdom of good <nobr>men—and</nobr> he will make a people fully ready for
          their Lord. Luke 1:17, Phillips.</p>
      <p>God had called the son of Zacharias to a great work, the greatest ever committed to men.... John was to go
          forth as Jehovah’s messenger, to bring</p>
      <p>to men the light of God. He must give a new direction to their thoughts. He must impress them with the holiness
          of God’s requirements, and their need of His perfect righteousness. Such a messenger must be holy. He must be
          a temple for the indwelling Spirit of God. In order to fulﬁll his mission, he must have a sound physical
          constitution, and mental and spiritual strength. Therefore it would be necessary for him to control the
          appetites and passions. He must be able so to control all his powers that he could stand among men as unmoved
          by surrounding circumstances as the rocks and mountains of the wilderness.</p>
      <p>In the time of John the Baptist, greed for riches, and the love of luxury and display had become widespread.
          Sensuous pleasures, feasting and drinking, were causing physical disease and degeneracy, benumbing the
          spiritual perceptions, and lessening the sensibility to sin. John was to stand as a reformer. By his
          abstemious life and plain dress he was to rebuke the excesses of his time. Hence the directions given to the
          parents of <nobr>John,—a</nobr> lesson of temperance by an angel from the throne of heaven....</p>
      <p>In preparing the way for Christ’s ﬁrst advent, he was a representative of those who are to prepare a people for
          our Lord’s second coming. The world is given to <nobr>self-indulgence.</nobr> Errors and fables abound.
          Satan’s snares for destroying are multiplied. All who would perfect holiness in the fear of God must learn the
          lessons of temperance and <nobr>self-control.</nobr> The appetites and passions must be held in subjection to
          the higher powers of the mind. This <nobr>self-discipline</nobr> is essential to that mental strength and
          spiritual insight which will enable us to understand and to practice the sacred truths of God’s word. For this
          reason temperance ﬁnds its place in the work of preparation for Christ’s second coming.</p>
