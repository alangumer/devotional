      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>4:1-5</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacriﬁce than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was
          righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. Hebrews 11:4.</p>
      <p>Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam, differed widely in character. Abel had a spirit of loyalty to God; he saw
          justice and mercy in the Creator’s dealings with the fallen race, and gratefully accepted the hope of
          redemption. But Cain cherished feelings of rebellion, and murmured against God because of the curse pronounced
          upon the earth and upon the human race for Adam’s sin. He permitted his mind to run in the same channel that
          led to Satan’s <nobr>fall—indulging</nobr> the desire for <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> and questioning the
          divine justice and authority....</p>
      <p>These two brothers erected their altars alike, and each brought an offering. Abel presented a sacriﬁce from the
          ﬂock, in accordance with the Lord’s directions. “And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering.” Fire
          ﬂashed from heaven and consumed the sacriﬁce. But Cain, disregarding the Lord’s direct and explicit command,
          presented only an offering of fruit. There was no token from heaven to show that it was accepted....</p>
      <p>Abel grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw himself a sinner, and he saw sin and its penalty,
          death, standing between his soul and communion with God. He brought the slain victim, the sacriﬁced life, thus
          acknowledging the claims of the law that had been transgressed. Through the shed blood he looked to the future
          sacriﬁce, Christ dying on the cross of Calvary; and trusting in the atonement that was there to be made, he
          had the witness that he was righteous, and his offering accepted.</p>
      <p>Cain had the same opportunity of learning and accepting these truths as had Abel. He was not the victim of an
          arbitrary purpose. One brother was not elected to be accepted of God, and the other to be rejected. Abel chose
          faith and obedience; Cain, unbelief and rebellion. Here the whole matter rested.</p>
