    <h1>Just for One Man</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>8:26-40</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth
          down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went. Acts 8:26, 27.</p>
      <p>Notice how much effort was put forth for just one man, an Ethiopian.</p>
      <p>This Ethiopian was a man of good standing and of wide inﬂuence. God saw that when converted he would give
          others the light he had received and would exert a strong inﬂuence in favor of the gospel. Angels of God were
          attending this seeker for light, and he was being drawn to the Saviour. By the ministration of the Holy Spirit
          the Lord brought him into touch with one who could lead him to the light.</p>
      <p>Philip was directed to go to the Ethiopian and explain to him the prophecy that he was reading. “Go near,” the
          Spirit said, “and join thyself to this chariot.”</p>
      <p>... The man’s heart thrilled with interest as the Scriptures were explained to him; and when the disciple had
          ﬁnished, he was ready to accept the light given. He did not make his high worldly position an excuse for
          refusing the gospel....</p>
      <p>This Ethiopian represented a large class who need to be taught by such missionaries as <nobr>Philip—men</nobr>
          who will hear the voice of God and go where He sends them. There are many who are reading the Scriptures who
          cannot understand their true import. All over the world men and women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers
          and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the Holy Spirit. Many are on the
          verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be gathered in.</p>
      <p>An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light and who was ready to receive the gospel, and today
          angels will guide the footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and
          reﬁne and ennoble their hearts.</p>
      <p>He who sent Philip to the Ethiopian councilor, Peter to the Roman centurion, and the little Israelitish maiden
          to the help of Naaman, the Syrian captain, sends men and women and youth today as His representatives to those
          in need of divine help and guidance.</p>
