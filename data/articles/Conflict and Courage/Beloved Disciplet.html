    <h1>Beloved Disciple</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We love him, because he ﬁrst loved us. 1 John 4:19.</strong></p>
      <p>John is distinguished above the other apostles as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (John 21:20).... He received
          many tokens of the Saviour’s conﬁdence and</p>
      <p>love. He was one of the three permitted to witness Christ’s glory upon the mount of transﬁguration and His
          agony in Gethsemane, and it was to his care that our Lord conﬁded His mother in those last hours of anguish
          upon the cross.</p>
      <p>John’s was a nature that longed for love, for sympathy and companionship. He pressed close to Jesus, sat by His
          side, leaned upon His breast. As a ﬂower the sun and dew, so did he drink in the divine light and life.</p>
      <p>The depth and fervor of John’s affection for his Master was not the cause of Christ’s love for him, but the
          effect of that love. John desired to become like Jesus, and under the transforming inﬂuence of the love of
          Christ he did become meek and lowly. Self was hid in Jesus. Above all his companions, John yielded himself to
          the power of that wondrous life.... John knew the Saviour by an experimental</p>
      <p>knowledge. His Master’s lessons were graven on his soul. When he testiﬁed of the Saviour’s grace, his simple
          language was eloquent with the love that pervaded his whole being.</p>
      <p>It was John’s deep love for Christ which led him always to desire to be close by His side. The Saviour loved
          all the Twelve, but John’s was the most receptive spirit. He was younger than the others, and with more of the
          child’s conﬁding trust he opened his heart to Jesus. Thus he came more into sympathy with Christ, and through
          him the Saviour’s deepest spiritual teaching was communicated to the people....</p>
      <p>John could talk of the Father’s love as no other of the disciples could. He revealed to his fellow men that
          which he felt in his own soul, representing in his character the attributes of God.... The beauty of holiness
          which had transformed</p>
      <p>him shone with a Christlike radiance from his countenance. In adoration and love he beheld the Saviour until
          likeness to Christ and fellowship with Him became his one desire, and in his character was reﬂected the
          character of his Master.</p>
