    <h1>Sower of Strife</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let
          him be your servant. Matthew 20:26, 27.</strong></p>
      <p>With Judas an element of antagonism was introduced among the disciples....</p>
      <p>That which ruled him was the hope of selﬁsh beneﬁt in the worldly kingdom which he expected Christ to
          establish. Though recognizing the divine power of the love of Christ, Judas did not yield to its supremacy. He
          continued to cherish his own judgment and opinions, his disposition to criticize and condemn. Christ’s motives
          and movements, often so far above his comprehension, excited doubt and disapproval, and his own questionings
          and ambitions were insinuated to the disciples. Many of their contentions for supremacy, much of their
          dissatisfaction with Christ’s methods, originated with Judas.</p>
      <p>He introduced controversies and misleading sentiments, repeating the arguments urged by the scribes and
          Pharisees against the claims of Christ....</p>
      <p>He would introduce texts of Scripture that had no connection with the truths Christ was presenting. These
          texts, separated from their connection, perplexed the disciples.... Yet all this was done by Judas in such a
          way as to make it</p>
      <p>appear that he was conscientious. And while the disciples were searching for evidence to conﬁrm the words of
          the Great Teacher, Judas would lead them almost imperceptibly on another track.... In all that Christ said to
          His disciples, there was</p>
      <p>something with which, in heart, Judas disagreed....</p>
      <p>Yet Judas made no open opposition, nor seemed to question the Saviour’s lessons. He made no outward murmur
          until the time of the feast in Simon’s house. When Mary anointed the Saviour’s feet, Judas manifested his
          covetous disposition. At the reproof from Jesus his very spirit seemed turned to gall. Wounded pride and
          desire for revenge broke down the barriers, and the greed so long indulged held him in control. This will be
          the experience of everyone who persists in tampering with sin. The elements of depravity that are not resisted
          and overcome respond to Satan’s temptation, and the soul is led captive at his will.</p>
