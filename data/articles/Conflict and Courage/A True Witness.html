    <h1>A True Witness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. And many believed on him
          there. John 10:41, 42.</strong></p>
      <p>In the announcement to Zacharias before the birth of John, the angel had declared, “He shall be great in the
          sight of the Lord” (Luke 1:15). In the estimation of Heaven, what is it that constitutes greatness? Not that
          which the world accounts greatness; not wealth, or rank, or noble descent, or intellectual gifts, in
          themselves considered.... It is moral worth that God values. Love and</p>
      <p>purity are the attributes He prizes most. John was great in the sight of the Lord, when, before the messengers
          from the Sanhedrin, before the people, and before his own disciples, he refrained from seeking honor for
          himself, but pointed all to Jesus as the Promised One. His unselﬁsh joy in the ministry of Christ presents the
          highest type of nobility ever revealed in man....</p>
      <p>Aside from the joy that John found in his mission, his life had been one of sorrow. His voice had been seldom
          heard except in the wilderness. His was a lonely lot. And he was not permitted to see the result of his own
          labors. It was not his privilege to be with Christ and witness the manifestation of divine power attending the
          greater light. It was not for him to see the blind restored to sight, the sick healed, and the dead raised to
          life. He did not behold the light that shone through every word of Christ, shedding glory upon the promises of
          prophecy. The least disciple who saw Christ’s mighty works and heard His words was in this sense more highly
          privileged than John the Baptist, and therefore is said to have been greater than he.</p>
      <p>It was not given to John to call down ﬁre from heaven, or to raise the dead, as Elijah did, nor to wield Moses’
          rod of power in the name of God. He was sent to herald the Saviour’s advent, and to call upon the people to
          prepare for His coming. So faithfully did he fulﬁll his mission that as the people recalled what he had taught
          them of Jesus, they could say, “All things that John spake of this Man were true.” Such witness to Christ
          every disciple of the Master is called upon to bear.</p>
