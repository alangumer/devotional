      <p><strong>Nehemiah <nobr>2:9-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me ... and they said, Let us rise up and build. So
          they strengthened their hands for this good work. Nehemiah 2:18.</p>
      <p>With <nobr>sorrow-stricken</nobr> heart, the visitor from afar gazed upon the ruined defenses of his loved
          Jerusalem. And is it not thus that angels of heaven survey the condition of the church of Christ? Like the
          dwellers at Jerusalem, we become accustomed to existing evils, and often are content while making no effort to
          remedy them. But how are these evils regarded by beings divinely illuminated? Do not they, like Nehemiah, look
          with <nobr>sorrow-burdened</nobr> heart upon ruined walls, and gates burned with ﬁre?</p>
      <p>Nehemiah bore a royal commission requiring the inhabitants to cooperate with him in rebuilding the walls of the
          city, but he did not depend upon the exercise of authority. He sought rather to gain the conﬁdence and
          sympathy of the people, knowing that a union of hearts as well as of hands was essential in the great work
          before him.</p>
      <p>There is need of Nehemiahs in the church <nobr>today,—not</nobr> men who can pray and preach only, but men
          whose prayers and sermons are braced with ﬁrm and eager purpose.... The success attending Nehemiah’s efforts
          shows what prayer, faith,</p>
      <p>and wise, energetic action will accomplish.... The spirit manifested by the leader</p>
      <p>will be, to a great extent, reﬂected by the people. If the leaders professing to believe the solemn, important
          truths that are to test the world at this time, manifest no ardent zeal to prepare a people to stand in the
          day of God, we must expect the church to be careless, indolent, and <nobr>pleasure-loving.</nobr></p>
      <p>Nehemiah was a reformer, a great man raised up for an important time. As he came in contact with evil and every
          kind of opposition, fresh courage and zeal were aroused. His energy and determination inspired the people of
          Jerusalem; and strength and courage took the place of feebleness and discouragement. His holy purpose, his
          high hope, his cheerful consecration to the work, were contagious. The people caught the enthusiasm of their
          leader, and in his sphere each man became a Nehemiah, and helped to make stronger the hand and heart of his
          neighbor.</p>
