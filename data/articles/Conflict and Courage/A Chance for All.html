    <h1>A Chance for All</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
          the will of my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 7:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Not all who profess to be workers for Christ are true disciples. Among those who bear His name, and who are
          even numbered with His workers, are some who do not represent Him in character.... Till the end of time there
          will be tares among</p>
      <p>the wheat....</p>
      <p>In His mercy and <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> God bears patiently with the perverse and even the falsehearted.
          Among Christ’s chosen apostles was Judas the traitor. Should it then be a cause of surprise or discouragement
          that there are falsehearted ones among His workers today? If He who reads the heart could bear with him who He
          knew was to be His betrayer, with what patience should we bear with those at fault.</p>
      <p>And not all, even of those who appear most faulty, are like Judas. Peter, impetuous, hasty, and
          <nobr>self-conﬁdent,</nobr> often appeared to far greater disadvantage than Judas did. He was oftener reproved
          by the Saviour. But what a life of service and sacriﬁce was his! What a testimony does it bear to the power of
          God’s grace!</p>
      <p>Christ connected Judas and impulsive Peter with Himself, not because Judas was covetous and Peter passionate,
          but that they might learn of Him, their great Teacher, and become, like Him, unselﬁsh, meek, and lowly of
          heart. He saw good material in both these men. Judas possessed ﬁnancial ability and would have been of value
          to the church had he taken home to his heart the lessons which Christ was giving by rebuking all selﬁshness,
          fraud, and avarice, even in the little matters of life.</p>
      <p>The world has no right to doubt the truth of Christianity because there are unworthy members in the church, nor
          should Christians become disheartened because of these false brethren. How was it with the early church?
          Ananias and Sapphira joined themselves to the disciples. Simon Magus was baptized....</p>
      <p>Judas Iscariot was numbered with the apostles. The Redeemer does not want to lose one soul; His experience with
          Judas is recorded to show His long patience with perverse human nature; and He bids us bear with it as He has
          borne.</p>
