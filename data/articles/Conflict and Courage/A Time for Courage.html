    <h1>A Time for Courage</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>14:1-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these
          uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many
          or by few. 1 Samuel 14:6.</p>
      <p>Because of Saul’s sin in his presumptuous offering, the Lord would not give him the honor of vanquishing the
          Philistines. Jonathan, the king’s son, a man who feared the Lord, was chosen as the instrument to deliver
          Israel. Moved by a divine impulse, he proposed to his <nobr>armor-bearer</nobr> that they should make a secret
          attack upon the enemy’s camp....</p>
      <p>Together they withdrew from the camp, secretly, lest their purpose should be opposed. With earnest prayer to
          the Guide of their fathers, they agreed upon a sign by which they might determine how to proceed....
          Approaching the Philistine</p>
      <p>fortress, they were revealed to the view of their enemies, who said, tauntingly, “Behold, the Hebrews come
          forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves,” then challenged them, “Come up to us, and we will show
          you a thing,” meaning that they would punish the two Israelites for their daring. This challenge was the token
          that Jonathan and his companion had agreed to accept as evidence that the Lord would prosper their
          undertaking. Passing now from the sight of the Philistines, and choosing a secret and difﬁcult path, the
          warriors made their way to the summit of a cliff that had been deemed inaccessible, and was not very strongly
          guarded. Thus they penetrated the enemy’s camp and slew the sentinels, who, overcome with surprise and fear,
          offered no resistance.</p>
      <p>Angels of heaven shielded Jonathan and his attendant, angels fought by their side, and the Philistines fell
          before them.</p>
      <p>These two men gave evidence that they were moving under the inﬂuence and command of a more than human general.
          To outward appearance, their venture was rash, and contrary to all military rules. But the action of Jonathan
          was not done in human rashness. He depended not on what he and his <nobr>armor-bearer</nobr> themselves could
          do; he was the instrument that God used in behalf of His people Israel.</p>
