      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>19:1-10</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without
          committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. Ezekiel 33:15.</p>
      <p>No sooner did Zacchaeus yield to the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit than he cast aside every practice contrary to
          integrity. No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation. The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak
          to cover unconfessed and unforsaken sin....</p>
      <p>Every converted soul will, like Zacchaeus, signalize the entrance of Christ into his heart by an abandonment of
          the unrighteous practices that have marked his life. Like the chief publican, he will give proof of his
          sincerity by making restitution....</p>
      <p>If we have injured others through any unjust business transaction, ... we should confess our wrong, and make
          restitution as far as lies in our power. It is right for us to restore not only that which we have taken, but
          all that it would have accumulated if put to a right and wise use during the time it has been in our
          possession.</p>
      <p>To Zacchaeus the Saviour said, “This day is salvation come to this house.” Not only was Zacchaeus himself
          blessed, but all his household with him.... They had</p>
      <p>been shut out from the synagogues by the contempt of rabbis and worshipers; but now, the most favored household
          in all Jericho, they gathered in their own home about the divine Teacher, and heard for themselves the words
          of life.</p>
      <p>It is when Christ is received as a personal Saviour that salvation comes to the soul. Zacchaeus had received
          Jesus, not merely as a passing guest in his home, but as One to abide in the soul temple.</p>
      <p>When the rich young ruler had turned away from Jesus, the disciples had marveled at their Master’s saying, “How
          hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!” They had exclaimed one to another,
          “Who then can be saved?” Now they had a demonstration of the truth of Christ’s words, “The things which are
          impossible with men are possible with God.” They saw how, through the grace of God, a rich man could enter
          into the kingdom.</p>
