    <h1>Peter Looked Back</h1>

      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>14:23-33</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? Matthew 14:31. Looking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely;
          but as in <nobr>self-satisfaction</nobr> he glances</p>
      <p>back toward his companions in the boat, his eyes are turned from the Saviour. The wind is boisterous. The waves
          roll high.... For a moment Christ is hidden from</p>
      <p>his view, and his faith gives way. He begins to sink. But while the billows talk with death, Peter lifts his
          eyes from the angry waters, and ﬁxing them upon Jesus, cries, “Lord, save me.” Immediately Jesus grasps the
          outstretched hand, saying, “O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?”</p>
      <p>Walking side by side, Peter’s hand in that of his Master, they stepped into the boat together. But Peter was
          now subdued and silent. He had no reason to boast over his fellows, for through unbelief and
          <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> he had very nearly lost, his life. When he turned his eyes from Jesus, his
          footing was lost and he sank amid the waves.</p>
      <p>When trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter! We look upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes
          ﬁxed upon the Saviour. Our footsteps slide, and the proud waters go over our souls. Jesus did not bid Peter
          come to Him that he should perish; He does not call us to follow Him, and then forsake us....</p>
      <p>In this incident on the sea He desired to reveal to Peter his own <nobr>weakness,—to</nobr> show that his
          safety was in constant dependence upon divine power. Amid the storms of temptation he could walk safely only
          as in utter <nobr>self-distrust</nobr> he should rely upon the Saviour. It was on the point where he thought
          himself strong that Peter was weak; and not until he discerned his weakness could he realize his need of
          dependence upon Christ. Had he learned the lesson that Jesus sought to teach him in that experience on the
          sea, he would not have failed when the great test came upon him.</p>
      <p>Day by day God instructs His children. By the circumstances of the daily life He is preparing them to act their
          part upon that wider stage to which His providence has appointed them. It is the issue of the daily test that
          determines their victory or defeat in life’s great crisis.</p>
