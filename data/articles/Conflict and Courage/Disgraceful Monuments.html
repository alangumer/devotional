      <p><strong>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: folly is
          set in great dignity. Ecclesiastes 10:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>In the days of King Josiah a strange appearance could be seen opposite the temple of God. Crowning the eminence
          of the Mount of Olives, peering above the groves of myrtle and olive trees, were unseemly, gigantic idols.
          Josiah gave commandment that these idols should be destroyed. This was done, and the broken fragments rolled
          down the channel of the Kidron. The shrines were left a mass of ruins.</p>
      <p>But the question was asked by many a devout worshiper, How came that architecture on the opposite side of the
          Jehoshaphat ravine, thus impiously confronting the temple of God? The truthful answer must be made: The
          builder was Solomon, the greatest king that ever wielded a sceptre. These idols bore testimony that he who had
          been honored and applauded as the wisest among kings, became a humiliating wreck....</p>
      <p>His once noble character, bold and true for God and righteousness, became deteriorated. His proﬂigate
          expenditure for selﬁsh indulgence made him the instrument of Satan’s devices. His conscience became hardened.
          His conduct as a judge changed from equity and righteousness to tyranny and oppression....</p>
      <p>Solomon tried to incorporate light with darkness, Christ with Belial, purity with impurity. But in the place of
          converting the heathen to the truth, pagan sentiments incorporated themselves with his religion. He became an
          apostate.</p>
      <p>The marks of Solomon’s apostasy lived ages after him. In the days of Christ, the worshipers in the temple could
          look, just opposite them, upon the Mount of Offense, and be reminded that the builder of their rich and
          glorious temple, the most renowned of all kings, had separated himself from God, and reared altars to heathen
          idols; that the mightiest ruler on earth had failed in ruling his own spirit. Solomon went down to death a
          repentant man; but his repentance and tears could not efface from the Mount of Offense the signs of his
          miserable departure from God. Ruined walls and broken pillars bore silent witness for a thousand years to the
          apostasy of the greatest king that ever sat upon an earthly throne.</p>
