    <h1>Sins That Scar</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers 25; Numbers 31:16</strong></p>
      <p>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: to keep
          thee from the evil woman, from the ﬂattery of the tongue of a strange woman. Proverbs 6:23, 24.</p>
      <p>The crime that brought the judgments of God upon Israel was that of licentiousness. The forwardness of women to
          entrap souls did not end at <nobr>Baal-peor.</nobr> Notwithstanding the punishment that followed the sinners
          in Israel, the same crime was repeated many times. Satan was most active in seeking to make Israel’s overthrow
          complete. Balak by the advice of Balaam laid the snare. Israel would have bravely met their enemies in battle,
          and resisted them, and come off conquerors; but when women invited their attention and sought their company
          and beguiled them by their charms, they did not resist temptations. They were invited to idolatrous feasts,
          and their indulgence in wine further beclouded their dazed minds. The power of <nobr>self-control,</nobr>
          their allegiance to God’s law, was not preserved. Their senses were so beclouded with wine, and their unholy
          passions had such full sway, overpowering every barrier, that they invited temptation even to the attending of
          these idolatrous feasts. Those who had never ﬂinched in battle, who were brave men, did not barricade their
          souls to resist temptation to indulge their basest passions.... They ﬁrst deﬁled their conscience by lewdness,
          and then</p>
      <p>departed from God still farther by idolatry, thus showing contempt for the God of Israel.</p>
      <p>Near the close of this earth’s history Satan will work with all his powers in the same manner and with the same
          temptations wherewith he tempted ancient Israel just before their entering the land of promise. He will lay
          snares for those who claim to keep the commandments of God, and who are almost on the borders of the heavenly
          Canaan. He will use his powers to their utmost in order to entrap souls, and to take God’s professed people
          upon their weakest points....</p>
      <p>It is now the duty of God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people to watch and pray, to search the Scriptures
          diligently, to hide the word of God in the heart, lest they sin against Him in idolatrous thoughts and
          debasing practices, and thus the church of God become demoralized.</p>
