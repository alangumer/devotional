    <h1>Mishandling God’s Goods</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts 4:32; Acts 5:11</strong></p>
      <p>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will
          surely require it of thee. Deuteronomy 23:21.</p>
      <p>The brief but terrible history of Ananias and Sapphira is traced by the pen of inspiration for the beneﬁt of
          all who profess to be the followers of Christ. This important lesson has not rested with sufﬁcient weight upon
          the minds of our people.... This one marked evidence of God’s retributive justice is fearful,</p>
      <p>and should lead all to fear and tremble to repeat sins which brought such a punishment....</p>
      <p>Ananias and his wife Sapphira had the privilege of hearing the gospel preached by the apostles.... While under
          the direct inﬂuence of the Spirit of</p>
      <p>God, they made a pledge to give to the Lord certain lands; but when they were no longer under this heavenly
          inﬂuence, the impression was less forcible, and they began to question and draw back from fulﬁlling the pledge
          which they had made.... Covetousness was ﬁrst cherished; then, ashamed to have their brethren</p>
      <p>know that their selﬁsh souls grudged that which they had solemnly dedicated and pledged to God, deception was
          practiced.... When convicted of their falsehood,</p>
      <p>their punishment was instant death.</p>
      <p>Not to the early church only, but to all future generations, this example of God’s hatred of covetousness,
          fraud, and hypocrisy, was given as a <nobr>danger-signal....</nobr> When the heart is stirred by the inﬂuence
          of the Holy Spirit,</p>
      <p>and a vow is made to give a certain amount, the one who vows has no longer any right to the consecrated
          portion. Promises of this kind made to men would be looked upon as binding; are those not more binding that
          are made to God? ...</p>
      <p>Many spend money lavishly in <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation.</nobr> Men and women consult their pleasure and gratify
          their taste, while they bring to God, almost unwillingly, a stinted offering. They forget that God will one
          day demand a strict account of how His goods have been used, and that He will no more accept the pittance they
          hand into the treasury than He accepted the offering of Ananias and Sapphira.</p>
