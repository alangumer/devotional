    <h1>Obstacles a Test of Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ezra <nobr>4:6-24</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For who hath despised the day of small things? Zechariah 4:10.</p>
      <p>In rebuilding the house of the Lord, Zerubbabel had labored in the face of manifold difﬁculties. From the
          beginning, adversaries had “weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,” “and
          made them to cease by force and power.” But the Lord had interposed in behalf of the builders, and now He
          spoke through His prophet to Zerubbabel, saying, “Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
          become a plain.” ...</p>
      <p>Throughout the history of God’s people great mountains of difﬁculty, apparently insurmountable, have loomed up
          before those who were trying to carry out the purposes of Heaven. Such obstacles are permitted by the Lord as
          a test of faith. When we are hedged about on every side, this is the time above all others to trust in God and
          in the power of His Spirit. The exercise of a living faith means an increase of spiritual strength and the
          development of an unfaltering trust. It is thus that the soul becomes a conquering power. Before the demand of
          faith, the obstacles placed by Satan across the pathway of the Christian will disappear; for the powers of
          heaven will come to his aid. “Nothing shall be impossible unto you.”</p>
      <p>The way of the world is to begin with pomp and boasting. God’s way is to make the day of small things the
          beginning of the glorious triumph of truth and righteousness. Sometimes He trains His workers by bringing to
          them disappointment and apparent failure. It is His purpose that they shall learn to master difﬁculties.</p>
      <p>Often men are tempted to falter before the perplexities and obstacles that confront them. But if they will hold
          the beginning of their conﬁdence steadfast unto the end, God will make the way clear.... Before the intrepid
          spirit and</p>
      <p>unwavering faith of a Zerubbabel, great mountains of difﬁculty will become a plain; and he whose hands have
          laid the foundation, even “his hands shall also ﬁnish it.”</p>
