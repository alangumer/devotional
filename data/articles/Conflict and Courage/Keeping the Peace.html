    <h1>Keeping the Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>13:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
          brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou will take the
          left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
          Genesis 13:8, 9.</p>
      <p>Abraham returned to Canaan “very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold.” Lot was still with him and again they
          came to Bethel, and pitched their tents by the altar which they had before erected. They soon found that
          increased possessions brought increased trouble. In the midst of hardships and trials they had dwelt together
          in harmony, but in their prosperity there was danger of strife between them. The pasturage was not sufﬁcient
          for the ﬂocks and herds of both.... It</p>
      <p>was evident that they must separate. Abraham was Lot’s senior in years, and his superior in relation, in wealth
          and in position; yet he was the ﬁrst to propose plans for preserving peace. Although the whole land had been
          given him by God Himself, he courteously waived his right....</p>
      <p>Here the noble, unselﬁsh spirit of Abraham was displayed. How many under similar circumstances would, at all
          hazards, cling to their individual rights and preferences! How many households have thus been rent asunder!
          How many churches have been divided, making the cause of truth a byword and a reproach among the wicked! “Let
          there be no strife between me and thee,” said Abraham, “for we be brethren;” not only by natural relationship,
          but as worshipers of the true God. The children of God the world over are one family, and the same spirit of
          love and conciliation should govern them. “Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor
          preferring one another” (Romans 12:10), is the teaching of our Saviour. The cultivation of a uniform courtesy,
          a willingness to do to others as we would wish them to do to us, would annihilate half the ills of life. The
          spirit of <nobr>self-aggrandizement</nobr> is the spirit of Satan; but the heart in which the love of Christ
          is cherished, will possess that charity which seeketh not her own. Such will heed the divine injunction, “Look
          not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others” (Philippians 2:4).</p>
