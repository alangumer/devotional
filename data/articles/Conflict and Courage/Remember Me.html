    <h1>“Remember Me”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>23:13-44</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. Luke 23:42.</p>
      <p>To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of comfort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief....
          This man was not a hardened criminal; he had</p>
      <p>been led astray by evil associations.... He had seen and heard Jesus, and had been</p>
      <p>convicted by His teaching, but he had been turned away from Him by the priests and rulers. Seeking to stiﬂe
          conviction, he had plunged deeper and deeper into sin, until he was arrested, tried as a criminal, and
          condemned to die on the cross.</p>
      <p>In the judgment hall and on the way to Calvary he had been in company with Jesus. He had heard Pilate declare,
          “I ﬁnd no fault in Him” (John 19:4). He had marked His godlike bearing, and His pitying forgiveness of His
          tormentors.... The</p>
      <p>conviction comes back to him that this is the Christ. Turning to his fellow criminal he says, “Dost not thou
          fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?” The dying thieves have no longer anything to fear from
          man. But upon one of them presses the conviction that there is a God to fear, a future to cause him to
          tremble. And now, all <nobr>sin-polluted</nobr> as it is, his life history is about to close....</p>
      <p>When condemned for his crime, the thief had become hopeless and despairing; but strange, tender thoughts now
          spring up. He calls to mind all he has heard of Jesus.... The Holy Spirit illuminates his mind, and little by
          little the chain of</p>
      <p>evidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the cross, he sees the Lamb of God,
          that taketh away the sin of the world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless, dying soul
          casts himself upon a dying Saviour. “Lord, remember me,” he cries, “when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.”</p>
      <p>Quickly the answer came. Soft and melodious the tone, full of love, compassion, and power the words: Verily I
          say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in paradise.... To the penitent thief came the perfect peace of
          acceptance</p>
      <p>with God.</p>
