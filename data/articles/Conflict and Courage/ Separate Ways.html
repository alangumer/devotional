      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>35:27-29</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life. John
          3:36.</p>
      <p>Jacob and Esau met at the deathbed of their father. Once the elder brother had looked forward to this event as
          an opportunity for revenge, but his feelings had since greatly changed. And Jacob, well content with the
          spiritual blessings of the birthright, resigned to the elder brother the inheritance of their father’s
          <nobr>wealth—the</nobr> only inheritance that Esau sought or valued....</p>
      <p>Esau and Jacob had alike been instructed in the knowledge of God, and both were free to walk in His
          commandments and to receive His favor; but they had not both chosen to do this. The two brothers had walked in
          different ways, and their paths would continue to diverge more and more widely.</p>
      <p>There was no arbitrary choice on the part of God by which Esau was shut out from the blessings of salvation.
          The gifts of His grace through Christ are free to all. There is no election but one’s own by which any may
          perish.... Every soul is</p>
      <p>elected who will work out his own salvation with fear and trembling. He is elected who will put on the armor
          and ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. He is elected who will watch unto prayer, who will search the Scriptures, and
          ﬂee from temptation. He is elected who will have faith continually, and who will be obedient to every word
          that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The provisions of redemption are free to all; the results of
          redemption will be enjoyed by those who have complied with the conditions.</p>
      <p>Esau had despised the blessings of the covenant. He had valued temporal above the spiritual good, and he had
          received that which he desired. It was by his own deliberate choice that he was separated from the people of
          God. Jacob had chosen the inheritance of faith. He had endeavored to obtain it by craft, treachery, and
          falsehood; but God had permitted his sin to work out its correction.... The</p>
      <p>baser elements of character were consumed in the furnace ﬁre, the true gold was reﬁned, until the faith of
          Abraham and Isaac appeared undimmed in Jacob.</p>
