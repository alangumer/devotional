    <h1>His Last Mistake</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Samuel <nobr>6:1-11</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the
          Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error. 2 Samuel 6:6, 7.</p>
      <p>The fate of Uzzah was a divine judgment upon the violation of a most explicit command. Through Moses the Lord
          had given special instruction concerning the transportation of the ark. None but the priests, the descendants
          of Aaron, were to touch it, or even to look upon it uncovered....</p>
      <p>The priests were to cover the ark, and then the Kohathites must lift it by the staves, which were placed in
          rings upon each side of the ark and were never removed. To the Gershonites and Merarites, who had in charge
          the curtains and boards and pillars of the tabernacle, Moses gave carts and oxen for the transportation of
          that which was committed to them. “But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the
          sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders” (Numbers 7:9). Thus in the
          bringing of the ark from Kirjathjearim there had been a direct and inexcusable disregard of the Lord’s
          directions....</p>
      <p>The Philistines, who had not a knowledge of God’s law, had placed the ark upon a cart when they returned it to
          Israel, and the Lord accepted the effort which they made. But the Israelites had in their hands a plain
          statement of the will of God in all these matters, and their neglect of these instructions was dishonoring to
          God. Upon Uzzah rested the greater guilt of presumption. Transgression of God’s law had lessened his sense of
          its sacredness, and with unconfessed sins upon him he had, in face of the divine prohibition, presumed to
          touch the symbol of God’s presence. God can accept no partial obedience, no lax way of treating His
          commandments. By the judgment upon Uzzah He designed to impress upon all Israel the importance of giving
          strict heed to His requirements. Thus the death of that one man, by leading the people to repentance, might
          prevent the necessity of inﬂicting judgments upon thousands.</p>
