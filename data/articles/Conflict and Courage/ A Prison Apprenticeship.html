    <h1>A Prison Apprenticeship</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>39:13-23</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>His feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in chains of iron: until the time that his word came to pass; the
          word of the Lord tried him. Psalm 105:18, 19, R.V.</p>
      <p>Joseph’s faithful integrity led to the loss of his reputation and his liberty. This is the severest test that
          the virtuous and <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> are subjected to, that vice seems to prosper while virtue is
          trampled in the dust.... Joseph’s religion kept his</p>
      <p>temper sweet and his sympathy with humanity warm and strong, notwithstanding all his trials.... No sooner does
          he enter upon prison life, than he brings all the</p>
      <p>brightness of his Christian principles into active exercise; he begins to make himself useful to others.... He
          is cheerful, for he is a Christian gentleman. God</p>
      <p>was preparing him under this discipline for a situation of great responsibility, honor, and usefulness, and he
          was willing to learn; he took kindly to the lessons the Lord would teach him. He learned to bear the yoke in
          his youth. He learned to govern by ﬁrst learning obedience himself.</p>
      <p>Joseph’s real character shines out, even in the darkness of the dungeon. He held fast his faith and patience;
          his years of faithful service had been most cruelly repaid, yet this did not render him morose or distrustful.
          He had the peace that comes from conscious innocence, and he trusted his case with God.... He found a</p>
      <p>work to do, even in the prison. God was preparing him in the school of afﬂiction for greater usefulness, and he
          did not refuse the needful discipline. In the prison, witnessing the results of oppression and tyranny and the
          effects of crime, he learned lessons of justice, sympathy, and mercy, that prepared him to exercise power with
          wisdom and compassion.... It was the part he acted in the <nobr>prison—the</nobr></p>
      <p>integrity of his daily life and his sympathy for those who were in trouble and <nobr>distress—that</nobr>
          opened the way for his future prosperity and honor. Every ray of light that we shed upon others is reﬂected
          upon ourselves. Every kind and sympathizing word spoken to the sorrowful, every act to relieve the oppressed,
          and every gift to the needy, if prompted by a right motive, will result in blessings to the giver.</p>
