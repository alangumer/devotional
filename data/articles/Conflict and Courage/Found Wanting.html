    <h1>Found Wanting</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>13:1-16</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came;
          and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 1 Samuel 13:10.</p>
      <p>God had directed that only those consecrated to the ofﬁce should present sacriﬁces before Him. But Saul
          commanded, “Bring hither a burnt offering;” and, equipped as he was with armor and weapons of war, he
          approached the altar and offered sacriﬁce before God.... If Saul had fulﬁlled the conditions upon which</p>
      <p>divine help was promised, the Lord would have wrought a marvelous deliverance for Israel, with the few who were
          loyal to the king. But Saul was so well satisﬁed with himself and his work that he went out to meet the
          prophet as one who should be commended rather than disapproved.</p>
      <p>Saul endeavored to vindicate his own course, and blamed the prophet, instead of condemning himself. There are
          today many who pursue a similar course. Like Saul they are blinded to their errors. When the Lord seeks to
          correct them, they receive reproof as insult, and ﬁnd fault with the one who brings the divine message.</p>
      <p>Had Saul been willing to see and confess his error, this bitter experience would have proved a safeguard for
          the future. He would afterward have avoided the mistakes which called forth divine reproof. But feeling that
          he was unjustly condemned, he would, of course, be likely again to commit the same sin.</p>
      <p>The Lord would have His people, under all circumstances, manifest implicit trust in Him. Although we cannot
          always understand the workings of His providence, we should wait with patience and humility until He sees ﬁt
          to enlighten us.</p>
      <p>Saul’s transgression proved him unworthy to be intrusted with sacred responsibilities.... Had he patiently
          endured the divine test, the crown would have</p>
      <p>been conﬁrmed to him and to his house. In fact, Samuel had come to Gilgal for this very purpose. But Saul had
          been weighed in the balance, and found wanting. He must be removed to make way for one who would sacredly
          regard the divine honor and authority.</p>
