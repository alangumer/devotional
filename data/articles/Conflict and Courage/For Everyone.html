      <p><strong>Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. Psalm
          68:31.</strong></p>
      <p>Throughout his ministry Isaiah bore a plain testimony concerning God’s purpose for the heathen. Other prophets
          had made mention of the divine plan, but their language was not always understood. To Isaiah it was given to
          make very plain to Judah the truth that among the Israel of God were to be numbered many who were not
          descendants of Abraham after the ﬂesh. This teaching was not in harmony with the theology of his age, yet he
          fearlessly proclaimed the messages given him of God and brought hope to many a longing heart reaching out
          after the spiritual blessings promised to the seed of Abraham....</p>
      <p>Often the Israelites seemed unable or unwilling to understand God’s purpose for the heathen. Yet it was this
          very purpose that had made them a separate people and had established them as an independent nation among the
          nations of the earth. Abraham, their father, to whom the covenant promise was ﬁrst given, had been called to
          go forth from his kindred, to the regions beyond, that he might be a light bearer to the heathen. Although the
          promise to him included a posterity as numerous as the sand by the sea, yet it was for no selﬁsh purpose that
          he was to become the founder of a great nation.... “I will bless thee,” Jehovah declared, “and</p>
      <p>make thy name great; ... in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” ...</p>
      <p>No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is recognized by God.... Christ came to demolish
          every wall of partition, to throw open every</p>
      <p>compartment of the temple courts, that every soul may have free access to God. His love is so broad, so deep,
          so full, that it penetrates everywhere. It lifts out of Satan’s inﬂuence those who have been deluded by his
          deceptions, and places them within reach of the throne of God, the throne encircled by the rainbow of promise.
          In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free.</p>
