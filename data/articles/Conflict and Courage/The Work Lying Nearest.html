    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>19:19-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. Luke 16:10.</p>
      <p>God had bidden Elijah anoint another to be prophet in his stead. “Elisha the son of Shaphat ... shalt thou
          anoint to be prophet in thy room,” He had said; and in obedience to the command, Elijah went to ﬁnd
          Elisha....</p>
      <p>Elisha’s father was a wealthy farmer, a man whose household were among the number that in a time of almost
          universal apostasy had not bowed the knee to Baal. Theirs was a home where God was honored and where
          allegiance to the faith of ancient Israel was the rule of daily life. In such surroundings the early years of
          Elisha were passed. In the quietude of country life, under the teaching of God and nature and the discipline
          of useful work, he received the training in habits of simplicity and of obedience to his parents and to God
          that helped to ﬁt him for the high position he was afterward to occupy.</p>
      <p>The prophetic call came to Elisha while, with his father’s servants, he was plowing in the ﬁeld. He had taken
          up the work that lay nearest. He possessed both the capabilities of a leader among men and the meekness of one
          who is ready to serve. Of a quiet and gentle spirit, he was nevertheless energetic and steadfast. Integrity,
          ﬁdelity, and the love and fear of God were his, and in the humble round of daily toil he gained strength of
          purpose and nobleness of character, constantly increasing in grace and knowledge. While
          <nobr>co-operating</nobr> with his father in the <nobr>home-life</nobr> duties, he was learning to
          <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with God.</p>
      <p>By faithfulness in little things, Elisha was preparing for weightier trusts. Day by day, through practical
          experience, he gained a ﬁtness for a broader, higher work.... None can know what may be God’s purpose in His
          discipline; but all</p>
      <p>may be certain that faithfulness in little things is the evidence of ﬁtness for greater responsibilities. Every
          act of life is a revelation of character, and he only who in small duties proves himself “a workman that
          needeth not to be ashamed” can be honored by God with higher service.</p>
