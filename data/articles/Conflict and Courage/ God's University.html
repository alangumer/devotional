      <p><strong>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their
          own craftiness. 1 Corinthians 3:19.</strong></p>
      <p>In their efforts to qualify themselves to be colaborers with God, men frequently place themselves in such
          positions as will completely disqualify them for the molding and fashioning which the Lord desires to give
          them. Thus they are not found bearing, as did Moses, the divine similitude. By submitting to God’s discipline,
          Moses became a sanctiﬁed channel through which the Lord could work. He did not hesitate to change his way for
          the Lord’s way, even though it did lead in strange paths, in untried ways....</p>
      <p>It was not the teachings of the schools of Egypt that enabled Moses to triumph over all his enemies, but an
          <nobr>ever-abiding</nobr> faith, an unﬂinching faith, a faith that did not fail under the most trying
          circumstances.... Moses acted as seeing the</p>
      <p>Invisible.</p>
      <p>God is not seeking for men of perfect education.... The Lord wants men to</p>
      <p>appreciate the privilege of being laborers together with <nobr>God—men</nobr> who will honor Him by rendering
          implicit obedience to His requirements regardless of previously inculcated theories....</p>
      <p>Many who are seeking efﬁciency for the exalted work of God by perfecting their education in the schools of men,
          will ﬁnd that they have failed of learning the more important lessons which the Lord would teach them. By
          neglecting to submit themselves to the impressions of the Holy Spirit, by not living in obedience to all God’s
          requirements, their spiritual efﬁciency has become weakened.... By</p>
      <p>absenting themselves from the school of Christ, they have forgotten the sound of the voice of the Teacher, and
          He cannot direct their course. Men may acquire all the knowledge possible to be imparted by the human teacher;
          but there is still greater wisdom required of them by God. Like Moses, they must learn meekness, lowliness of
          heart, and distrust of self. Our Saviour Himself, bearing the test for humanity, acknowledged that of Himself
          He could do nothing. We must also learn that there is no strength in humanity alone. Man becomes efﬁcient only
          by becoming a partaker of the divine nature.</p>
