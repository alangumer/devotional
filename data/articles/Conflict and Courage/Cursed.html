    <h1>Cursed!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>3:14-19</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; ... and thy desire shall be to
          thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, ... cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
          sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Genesis 3:16, 17.</p>
      <p>Eve was told of the sorrow and pain that must henceforth be her portion.... In</p>
      <p>the creation God had made her the equal of Adam. Had they remained obedient to <nobr>God—in</nobr> harmony with
          His great law of <nobr>love—they</nobr> would ever have been in harmony with each other; but sin had brought
          discord, and now their union could be maintained and harmony preserved only by submission on the part of the
          one or the other. Eve had been the ﬁrst in transgression; and she had fallen into temptation by separating
          from her companion, contrary to the divine direction. It was by her solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was
          now placed in subjection to her husband....</p>
      <p>Eve had been perfectly happy by her husband’s side in her Eden home; but, like restless modern Eves, she was
          ﬂattered with the hope of entering a higher sphere than that which God had assigned her. In attempting to rise
          above her original position, she fell far below it. A similar result will be reached by all who are unwilling
          to take up cheerfully their life duties in accordance with God’s plan. In their efforts to reach positions for
          which He has not ﬁtted them, many are leaving vacant the place where they might be a blessing....</p>
      <p>When God made man, He made him ruler over the earth and all living creatures. So long as Adam remained loyal to
          Heaven, all nature was in subjection to him. But when he rebelled against the divine law, the inferior
          creatures were in rebellion against his rule. Thus the Lord, in His great mercy, would show men the sacredness
          of His law, and lead them, by their own experience, to see the danger of setting it aside, even in the
          slightest degree.</p>
      <p>And the life of toil and care which was henceforth to be man’s lot was appointed in love. It was a discipline
          rendered needful by his sin, to place a check upon the indulgence of appetite and passion, to develop habits
          of <nobr>self-control.</nobr> It was a part of God’s great plan for man’s recovery from the ruin and
          degradation of sin.</p>
