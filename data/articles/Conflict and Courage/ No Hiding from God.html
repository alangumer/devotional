    <h1>No Hiding from God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Joshua 7</strong></p>
      <p>Neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. Joshua 7:12.</p>
      <p>The sin of one man caused Israel to be beaten before the enemy. Something more than prayer was required. They
          were to get up and cleanse the camp of Israel.</p>
      <p>Have you considered why it was that all who were connected with Achan were also subjects of the punishment of
          God? It was because they had not been trained and educated according to the directions given them in the great
          standard of the law of God. Achan’s parents had educated their son in such a way that he felt free to disobey
          the Word of the Lord; the principles inculcated in his life led him to deal with his children in such a way
          that they also were corrupted.... The</p>
      <p>punishment ... reveals the fact that all were involved in the transgression.</p>
      <p>The history of Achan teaches the solemn lesson that for one man’s sin the displeasure of God will rest upon a
          people or a nation till the transgression is searched out and punished. Sin is corrupting in its nature. One
          man infected with its deadly leprosy may communicate the taint to thousands. Those who occupy responsible
          positions as guardians of the people are false to their trust if they do not faithfully search out and reprove
          sin....</p>
      <p>The love of God will never lead to the belittling of sin; it will never cover or excuse an unconfessed
          wrong.... It has to do with all our acts and thoughts</p>
      <p>and feelings. It follows us, and reaches every secret spring of action. By indulgence in sin, men are led to
          lightly regard the law of God. Many conceal their transgressions from their fellow men, and ﬂatter themselves
          that God will not be strict to mark iniquity. But His law is the great standard of right, and with it every
          act of life must be compared in that day when God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
          thing, whether it be good or evil. Purity of heart will lead to purity of life. All excuses for sin are vain.
          Who can plead for the sinner when God testiﬁes against him?</p>
