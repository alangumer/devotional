      <p><strong>1 Samuel 12</strong></p>
      <p>And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not
          found ought in my hand. 1 Samuel 12:5.</p>
      <p>The dissatisﬁed longing for worldly power and display, is as difﬁcult to cure now as in the days of Samuel.
          Christians seek to build as worldlings build, to dress as worldlings <nobr>dress—to</nobr> imitate the customs
          and practices of those who worship only the God of this world. The instructions of God’s Word, the counsels
          and reproofs of His servants, and even warnings sent directly from His throne, seem powerless to subdue this
          unworthy ambition. When the heart is estranged from God, almost any pretext is sufﬁcient to justify a
          disregard of His authority....</p>
      <p>The most useful men are seldom appreciated. Those who have labored most actively and unselﬁshly for their
          fellow man, and who have been instrumental in achieving the greatest results, are often repaid with
          ingratitude and neglect. When such men ﬁnd themselves set aside, their counsels slighted and despised, they
          may feel that they are suffering great injustice. But let them learn from the example of Samuel not to justify
          or vindicate themselves, unless the Spirit of God unmistakably prompts to such a course.</p>
      <p>The honor accorded him who is concluding his work is of far more worth than the applause and congratulations
          which those receive who are just entering upon their duties, and who have yet to be tested.</p>
      <p>How many retiring from a position of responsibility as a judge, can say in regard to their purity, Which of you
          convinceth me of sin? Who can prove that I have turned aside from my righteousness to accept bribes? I have
          never stained my record as a man who does judgment and justice. Who today can say what Samuel said when he was
          taking leave of the people of Israel, because they were determined to have a king? ... Brave, noble judge! But
          it is a sorrowful thing that a man of the strictest integrity should have to humble himself to make his own
          defence.</p>
