    <h1>God’s Choice, Not Man’s</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>16:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord said unto Samuel, ... ﬁll thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite:
          for I have provided me a king among his sons. 1 Samuel 16:1.</p>
      <p>When the sacriﬁce was ended, and before partaking of the offering feast, Samuel began his prophetic inspection
          of the <nobr>noble-appearing</nobr> sons of Jesse. Eliab was the eldest, and more nearly resembled Saul for
          stature and beauty than the others. His comely features and ﬁnely developed form attracted the attention of
          the prophet. As Samuel looked upon his princely bearing, he thought, “This is indeed the man whom God has
          chosen as successor to Saul.” ... But Jehovah did not look upon the outward appearance. Eliab did not fear the
          Lord. Had he been called to the throne, he would have been a proud, exacting ruler....</p>
      <p>No outward beauty can recommend the soul to God. The wisdom and excellence revealed in the character and
          deportment, express the true beauty of the man; and it is the inner worth, the excellency of the heart, that
          determines our acceptance with the Lord of hosts. How deeply should we feel this truth in the judgment of
          ourselves and others. We may learn from the mistake of Samuel how vain is the estimation that rests on beauty
          of face or nobility of stature.</p>
      <p>The elder brothers, from whom Samuel would have chosen, did not possess the qualiﬁcations that God saw to be
          essential in a ruler of His people. Proud, <nobr>self-centered,</nobr><nobr>self-conﬁdent,</nobr> they were
          set aside for the one whom they lightly regarded, one who had preserved the simplicity and sincerity of his
          youth, and who, while little in his own sight, could be trained by God for the responsibilities of the
          kingdom. So today, in many a child whom the parents would pass by, God sees capabilities far above those
          revealed by others who are thought to possess great promise. And as regards life’s possibilities, who is
          capable of deciding what is great and what is small? How many a worker in the lowly places of life, by setting
          on foot agencies for the blessing of the world, has achieved results that kings might envy!</p>
