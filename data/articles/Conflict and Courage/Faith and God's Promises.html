    <h1>Faith and God’s Promises</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Habakkuk</strong></p>
      <p>Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith. Habakkuk
          2:4.</p>
      <p>At the time Josiah began to rule, and for many years before, the truehearted in Judah were questioning whether
          God’s promises to ancient Israel could ever be fulﬁlled....</p>
      <p>These anxious questionings were voiced by the prophet Habakkuk. Viewing the situation of the faithful in his
          day, he expressed the burden of his heart in the inquiry: “O Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not
          hear!” ... And then, his faith reaching out beyond the forbidding prospect of the immediate future, and laying
          fast hold on the precious promises that reveal God’s love for His trusting children, the prophet added, “We
          shall not die.” With this declaration of faith he rested his case, and that of every believing Israelite, in
          the hands of a compassionate God....</p>
      <p>The faith that strengthened Habakkuk and all the holy and the just in those days of deep trial was the same
          faith that sustains God’s people today. In the darkest hours, under circumstances the most forbidding, the
          Christian believer may keep his soul stayed upon the source of all light and power. Day by day, through faith
          in God, his hope and courage may be renewed. “The just shall live by his faith.” ...</p>
      <p>We must cherish and cultivate the faith of which prophets and apostles have <nobr>testiﬁed—the</nobr> faith
          that lays hold on the promises of God and waits for deliverance in His appointed time and way. The sure word
          of prophecy will meet its ﬁnal fulﬁllment in the glorious advent of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as King
          of kings and Lord of lords.... With the prophet who endeavored to encourage</p>
      <p>Judah in a time of unparalleled apostasy, let us conﬁdently declare, “The Lord is in his holy temple: let all
          the earth keep silence before him.” Let us ever hold in remembrance the cheering message, “The vision is yet
          for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it
          will surely come.”</p>
