    <h1>God’s Ways</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>5:5-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are
          higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. Isaiah 55:8,
          9.</p>
      <p>Naaman the Syrian consulted the prophet of God as to how he could be cured of a loathsome disease, the leprosy.
          He was bidden to go and bathe in Jordan seven times. Why did he not immediately follow the directions of
          Elisha, the prophet of God? ... In his mortiﬁcation and disappointment he became passionate, and in a rage
          refused to follow the humble course marked out by the prophet of God. “I thought,” said he, “he will surely
          come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and
          recover the leper. Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I
          not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.” His servant said: “My father, if the
          prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith
          to thee, Wash [merely], and be clean?” Yes, this great man considered it beneath his dignity to go to the
          humble river Jordan, and wash. The rivers he mentioned and desired were beautiﬁed by surrounding trees and
          groves, and idols were placed in these groves. Many ﬂocked to these rivers to worship their idol gods;
          therefore it would have cost him no humility. But it was following the speciﬁed directions of the prophet
          which would humble his proud and lofty spirit. Willing obedience would bring the desired result. He washed,
          and was made whole.</p>
      <p>Our plans are not always God’s plans.... In His loving care and interest for</p>
      <p>us, often He who understands us better than we understand ourselves refuses to permit us selﬁshly to seek the
          gratiﬁcation of our own ambition.... Many things</p>
      <p>He ask us to yield to Him, but in doing this we are but giving up that which hinders us in the heavenward
          way....</p>
      <p>In the future life the mysteries that here have annoyed and disappointed us will be made plain. We shall see
          that our seemingly unanswered prayers and disappointed hopes have been among our greatest blessings.</p>
