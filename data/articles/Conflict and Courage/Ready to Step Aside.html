      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>3:1-12</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. John 1:29.</p>
      <p>For a time the Baptist’s inﬂuence over the nation had been greater than that of its rulers, priests, or
          princes. If he had announced himself as the Messiah, and raised a revolt against Rome, priests and people
          would have ﬂocked to his standard. Every consideration that appeals to the ambition of the world’s conquerors
          Satan had stood ready to urge upon John the Baptist. But with the evidence before him of his power, he had
          steadfastly refused the splendid bribe. The attention which was ﬁxed upon him he had directed to Another. Now
          he saw the tide of popularity turning away from himself to the Saviour. Day by day the crowds about him
          lessened....</p>
      <p>The disciples of John came to him ... saying, “Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bearest
          witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.” Through these words, Satan brought temptation
          upon John. Though John’s mission seemed about to close, it was still possible for him to hinder the work of
          Christ. If he had sympathized with himself, and expressed grief or disappointment at being superseded, he
          would have sown the seeds of dissension, would have encouraged envy and jealousy, and would seriously have
          impeded the progress of the gospel.</p>
      <p>John had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to humanity, but the touch of divine love had transformed
          him. He dwelt in an atmosphere uncontaminated with selﬁshness and ambition, and far above the miasma of
          jealousy.... It was his joy to witness the success of the Saviour’s work....</p>
      <p>Looking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height of <nobr>self-abnegation.</nobr> He sought not
          to attract men to himself, but to lift their thoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon the
          Lamb of God. He himself had been only a voice, a cry in the wilderness. Now with joy he accepted silence and
          obscurity that the eyes of all might be turned to the Light of life. Those who are true to their calling as
          messengers for God will not seek honor for themselves. Love for self will be swallowed up in love for
          Christ.</p>
