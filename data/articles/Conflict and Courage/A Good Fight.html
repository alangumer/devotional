    <h1>A Good Fight</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have fought a good ﬁght, I have ﬁnished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up
          for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me
          only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 2 Timothy 4:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>Through his long term of service, Paul had never faltered in his allegiance to his Saviour. Wherever he
          <nobr>was—whether</nobr> before scowling Pharisees, or Roman authorities; before the furious mob at Lystra, or
          the convicted sinners in the Macedonian dungeon; whether reasoning with the <nobr>panic-stricken</nobr>
          sailors on the shipwrecked vessel, or standing alone before Nero to plead for his <nobr>life—he</nobr> had
          never been ashamed of the cause he was advocating. The one great purpose of his Christian life had been to
          serve Him whose name had once ﬁlled him with contempt; and from this purpose no opposition or persecution had
          been able to turn him aside.</p>
      <p>Paul’s life was an exempliﬁcation of the truths he taught, and herein lay his power. His heart was ﬁlled with a
          deep, abiding sense of his responsibility, and he labored in close communion with Him who is the fountain of
          justice, mercy, and truth.... The love of the Saviour was the undying motive that upheld him in</p>
      <p>his conﬂicts with self and in his struggles against evil as in the service of Christ he pressed forward against
          the unfriendliness of the world and the opposition of his enemies.</p>
      <p>What the church needs in these days of peril is an army of workers who, like Paul, have educated themselves for
          usefulness, who have a deep experience in the things of God, and who are ﬁlled with earnestness and zeal.
          Sanctiﬁed, <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> men are needed; men who will not shun trial and responsibility; men
          who are brave and true; men in whose hearts Christ is formed “the hope of glory,” and who with lips touched
          with holy ﬁre will “preach the word.” ...</p>
      <p>Will our young men accept the holy trust at the hands of their fathers? Are they preparing to ﬁll the vacancies
          made by the death of the faithful? Will the apostle’s charge be heeded, the call to duty be heard, amidst the
          incitements to selﬁshness and ambition that allure the youth?</p>
