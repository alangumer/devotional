    <h1>Nebuchadnezzar Humiliated</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Daniel 4</strong></p>
      <p>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of
          heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
          Daniel 4:35.</p>
      <p>The last dream which God gave to Nebuchadnezzar, and the experience of the king in connection with it, contain
          lessons of vital importance to all those who are connected with the work of God. The king was troubled with
          his dream; for it was evidently a prediction of adversity, and none of his wise men would attempt to interpret
          it. The faithful Daniel stood before the king, not to ﬂatter, not to misinterpret in order to secure favor. A
          solemn duty rested upon him to tell the king of Babylon the truth....</p>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar did not heed the <nobr>heaven-sent</nobr> message. One year after he had been thus warned, as he
          walked in his palace, he said within himself, “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built ...?” The God of
          heaven read the heart of the king, and heard its whisperings of <nobr>self-congratulation....</nobr> “There
          fell a voice from</p>
      <p>heaven, saying, ... The kingdom is departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling
          shall be with the beasts of the ﬁeld: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass
          over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
          will. The same hour was the thing fulﬁlled upon Nebuchadnezzar.”</p>
      <p>For seven years Nebuchadnezzar was an astonishment to all his subjects; for seven years he was humbled before
          all the world. Then his reason was restored and, looking up in humility to the God of heaven, he recognized
          the divine hand in his chastisement. In a public proclamation he acknowledged his guilt and the great mercy of
          God in his restoration....</p>
      <p>God’s purpose that the greatest kingdom in the world should show forth His praise was now fulﬁlled. This public
          proclamation, in which Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged the mercy and goodness and authority of God, was the last
          act of his life recorded in sacred history.</p>
