    <h1>Learning and Unlearning</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>2:15-3:1</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. Proverbs 2:6.</p>
      <p>In the wilds of Midian, Moses spent forty years as a keeper of sheep. Apparently cut off forever from his
          life’s mission, he was receiving the discipline essential for its fulﬁllment.</p>
      <p>Moses had been learning much that he must unlearn. The inﬂuences that had surrounded him in
          <nobr>Egypt—the</nobr> love of his foster mother, his own high position as the king’s grandson, the
          dissipation on every hand, the reﬁnement, the subtlety, and the mysticism of a false religion, the splendor of
          idolatrous worship, the solemn grandeur of architecture and <nobr>sculpture—all</nobr> had left deep
          impressions upon his developing mind and had molded, to some extent, his habits and character. Time, change of
          surroundings, and communion with God could remove these impressions. It would require on the part of Moses
          himself a struggle as for life to renounce error and accept truth, but God would be his helper when the
          conﬂict should be too severe for human strength....</p>
      <p>In order to receive God’s help, man must realize his weakness and deﬁciency; he must apply his own mind to the
          great change to be wrought in himself.... Many</p>
      <p>never attain to the position that they might occupy, because they wait for God to do for them that which He has
          given them power to do for themselves....</p>
      <p>Shut in by the bulwarks of the mountains, Moses was alone with God. The magniﬁcent temples of Egypt no longer
          impressed his mind with their superstition and falsehood. In the solemn grandeur of the everlasting hills he
          beheld the majesty of the Most High, and in contrast realized how powerless and insigniﬁcant were the gods of
          Egypt. Everywhere the Creator’s name was written. Moses seemed to stand in His presence and to be overshadowed
          by His power. Here his pride and <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> were swept away. In the stern simplicity of his
          wilderness life, the results of the ease and luxury of Egypt disappeared. Moses became patient, reverent, and
          humble, “very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3), yet strong in
          faith in the mighty God of Jacob.</p>
