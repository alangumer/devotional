    <h1>Running Ahead of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>13:1-16</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal;
          and the people were scattered from him. 1 Samuel 13:8.</p>
      <p>It was not until the second year of Saul’s reign that an attempt was made to subdue the Philistines. The ﬁrst
          blow was struck by Jonathan, the king’s son, who attacked and overcame their garrison at Geba. The
          Philistines, exasperated by this defeat, made ready for a speedy attack upon Israel. Saul now caused war to be
          proclaimed....</p>
      <p>Before the time appointed by the prophet had fully expired, he became impatient at the delay and allowed
          himself to be discouraged by the trying circumstances that surrounded him....</p>
      <p>The time for the proving of Saul had come. He was now to show whether or not he would depend on God and
          patiently wait according to His command, thus revealing himself as one whom God could trust in trying places
          as the ruler of His people, or whether he would be vacillating and unworthy of the sacred responsibility that
          had devolved upon him.</p>
      <p>In detaining Samuel, it was the purpose of God that the heart of Saul should be revealed, that others might
          know what he would do in an emergency. It was a trying position in which to be placed, but Saul did not obey
          orders. He felt that it would make no difference who approached God, or in what way; and, full of energy and
          <nobr>self-complacency,</nobr> he put himself forward into the sacred ofﬁce.</p>
      <p>The Lord has His appointed agencies; and if these are not discerned and respected by those who are connected
          with His work, if men feel free to disregard God’s requirements, they must not be kept in positions of trust.
          They would not listen to counsel, nor to the commands of God through His appointed agencies. Like Saul, they
          would rush into a work that was never appointed them, and the mistakes they would make in following their
          human judgment would place the Israel of God where their Leader could not reveal Himself to them.</p>
