    <h1>A Suicide</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>31:1-6</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
          Proverbs 11:5.</p>
      <p>On the plain of Shunem and the slopes of Mount Gilboa the armies of Israel and the hosts of the Philistines
          closed in mortal combat. Though the fearful scene in the cave of Endor had driven all hope from his heart,
          Saul fought with desperate valor for his throne and his kingdom. But it was in vain. “The men of Israel ﬂed
          from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa.” Three brave sons of the king died at his
          side. The archers pressed upon Saul. He had seen his soldiers falling around him and his princely sons cut
          down by the sword. Himself wounded, he could neither ﬁght nor ﬂy. Escape was impossible, and determined not to
          be taken alive by the Philistines, he bade his <nobr>armor-bearer,</nobr> “Draw thy sword, and thrust me
          through therewith.” When the man refused to lift his hand against the Lord’s anointed, Saul took his own life
          by falling upon his sword. Thus the ﬁrst king of Israel perished, with the guilt of <nobr>self-murder</nobr>
          upon his soul.</p>
      <p>By following the dictates of Satan, Saul was himself hastening the very result which, with unsanctiﬁed ability,
          he was endeavoring to avert.</p>
      <p>The counsel of the Lord had been disregarded again and again by the rebellious king, and the Lord had given him
          up to the folly of his own wisdom. The inﬂuences of the Spirit of God would have restrained him from the
          course of evil which he had chosen, that eventually worked out his ruin. God hates all sin, and when man
          persistently refuses all the counsel of heaven, he is left to the deceptions of the enemy, to be drawn away of
          his own lusts, and enticed.</p>
      <p>The ﬁrst king of Israel proved a failure, because he set his will above the will of God. Through the prophet
          Samuel the Lord instructed Saul that as king of Israel his course of action must be one of strictest
          integrity. Then God would bless his government with prosperity. But Saul refused to make obedience to God his
          ﬁrst consideration, and the principles of heaven the government of his conduct. He died in dishonor and
          despair.</p>
