      <p><strong>The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
          Job 17:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Sacred history presents many illustrations of the results of true education. It presents many noble examples of
          men whose characters were formed under divine direction, men whose lives were a blessing to their fellow men
          and who stood in the world as representatives of God. Among these are Joseph and Daniel, Moses, Elisha, and
          <nobr>Paul—the</nobr> greatest statesmen, the wisest legislator, one of the most faithful of reformers, and
          except Him who spoke as never man spake, the most illustrious teacher that this world has known.</p>
      <p>In early life, just as they were passing from youth to manhood, Joseph and Daniel were separated from their
          homes and carried as captives to heathen lands. Especially was Joseph subject to the temptations that attend
          great changes of fortune. In his father’s home a tenderly cherished child; in the house of Potiphar a slave,
          then a conﬁdant and companion; a man of affairs, educated by study, observation, contact with men; in
          Pharaoh’s dungeon a prisoner of state, condemned unjustly, without hope of vindication or prospect of release;
          called at a great crisis to the leadership of the <nobr>nation—what</nobr> enabled him to preserve his
          integrity? ...</p>
      <p>Loyalty to God, faith in the Unseen, was Joseph’s anchor. In this lay the hiding of his power....</p>
      <p>By their wisdom and justice, by the purity and benevolence of their daily life, by their devotion to the
          interests of the <nobr>people—and</nobr> they <nobr>idolaters—Joseph</nobr> and Daniel proved themselves true
          to the principles of their early training, true to Him whose representative they were....</p>
      <p>What a lifework was that of these noble Hebrews!...</p>
      <p>The same mighty truths that were revealed through these men, God desires to reveal through the youth and the
          children of today. The history of Joseph and Daniel is an illustration of what He will do for those who yield
          themselves to Him and with the whole heart seek to accomplish His purpose.</p>
