      <p><strong>John <nobr>3:1-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing
          of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit. Titus 3:5, R.S.V.</p>
      <p>Nicodemus held a high position of trust in the Jewish nation. He was highly educated, and possessed talents of
          no ordinary character, and he was an honored member of the national council. With others, he had been stirred
          by the teaching of Jesus....</p>
      <p>He greatly desired an interview with Jesus, but shrank from seeking Him openly.... He waited until the city was
          hushed in slumber, and then sought Him....</p>
      <p>“Rabbi,” he said, “we know that thou art a teacher come from God.” ... His words were designed to express and
          to invite conﬁdence; but they really expressed unbelief. He did not acknowledge Jesus to be the Messiah, but
          only a teacher sent from God....</p>
      <p>Jesus bent His eyes upon the speaker, as if reading his very soul. In His inﬁnite wisdom He saw before Him a
          seeker after truth.... He came directly to the point,</p>
      <p>saying solemnly, yet kindly, “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born from above, he cannot see
          the kingdom of God” (John 3:3, margin)....</p>
      <p>Nicodemus had heard the preaching of John the Baptist concerning repentance and baptism.... Yet the
          <nobr>heart-searching</nobr> message of the Baptist had failed to work</p>
      <p>in him conviction of sin. He was a strict Pharisee, and prided himself on his good works. He was widely
          esteemed for his benevolence and his liberality in sustaining the temple service, and he felt secure of the
          favor of God. He was startled at the thought of a kingdom too pure for him to see in his present
          state....</p>
      <p>By virtue of his birth as an Israelite he regarded himself as sure of a place in the kingdom of God. He felt
          that he needed no change. Hence his surprise at the Saviour’s words. He was irritated by their close
          application to himself. The pride of the Pharisee was struggling against the honest desire of the seeker after
          truth.</p>
