    <h1>Four in the Furnace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Daniel 3</strong></p>
      <p>Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning ﬁery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
          hand, O king. Daniel 3:17.</p>
      <p>The Lord did not forget His own. As His witnesses were cast into the furnace, the Saviour revealed Himself to
          them in person, and together they walked in the midst of the ﬁre. In the presence of the Lord of heat and
          cold, the ﬂames lost their power to consume.</p>
      <p>From his royal seat the king looked on, expecting to see the men who had deﬁed him utterly destroyed. But his
          feelings of triumph suddenly changed. The nobles standing near saw his face grow pale as he started from the
          throne and looked intently into the glowing ﬂames. In alarm the king, turning to his lords, asked, “Did not we
          cast three men bound into the midst of the ﬁre? ... Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the ﬁre,
          and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.”</p>
      <p>How did that heathen king know what the Son of God was like? The Hebrew captives ﬁlling positions of trust in
          Babylon had in life and character represented before him the truth. When asked for a reason of their faith,
          they had given it without hesitation. Plainly and simply they had presented the principles of righteousness,
          thus teaching those around them of the God whom they worshiped. They had told of Christ, the Redeemer to come;
          and in the form of the fourth in the midst of the ﬁre the king recognized the Son of God....</p>
      <p>He who walked with the Hebrew worthies in the ﬁery furnace will be with His followers wherever they are. His
          abiding presence will comfort and sustain. In the midst of the time of <nobr>trouble—trouble</nobr> such as
          has not been since there was a <nobr>nation—His</nobr> chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with all the
          hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God’s saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and
          in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a “God of gods,” able to save to the uttermost those who have
          put their trust in Him.</p>
