    <h1>Witnessing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Daniel 1</strong></p>
      <p>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others,
          I myself should be a castaway. 1 Corinthians 9:27.</p>
      <p>As God called Daniel to witness for Him in Babylon, so He calls us to be His witnesses in the world today. In
          the smallest as well as the largest affairs of life, He desires us to reveal to men the principles of His
          kingdom. Many are waiting for some great work to be brought to them, while daily they lose opportunities for
          revealing faithfulness to God. Daily they fail of discharging with wholeheartedness the little duties of
          life....</p>
      <p>In the life of the true Christian there are no nonessentials; in the sight of Omnipotence every duty is
          important. The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for service. The unused capabilities are just as
          much brought into account as those that are used. We shall be judged by what we ought to have done, but did
          not accomplish because we did not use our powers to glorify God.</p>
      <p>A noble character is not the result of accident; it is not due to special favors or endowments of Providence.
          It is the result of <nobr>self-discipline,</nobr> of subjection of the lower to the higher nature, of the
          surrender of self to the service of God and man....</p>
      <p>The body is a most important medium through which the mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding of
          character. Hence it is that the adversary of souls directs his temptations to the enfeebling and degrading of
          the physical powers....</p>
      <p>The body is to be brought into subjection to the higher powers of the being. The passions are to be controlled
          by the will, which is itself to be under the control of God. The kingly power of reason, sanctiﬁed, by divine
          grace, is to bear sway in the life. Intellectual power, physical stamina, and the length of life depend upon
          immutable laws. Through obedience to these laws, man may stand conqueror of himself, conqueror of his own
          inclinations, conqueror of ... “the rulers of the darkness of this world,” and of “spiritual wickedness in
          high places.”</p>
