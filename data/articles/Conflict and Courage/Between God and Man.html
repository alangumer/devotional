    <h1>Between God and Man</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>3:22-24</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to
          make intercession for them. Hebrews 7:25.</p>
      <p>The Lord did not place in Adam fallen and disobedient, the conﬁdence He placed in Adam loyal and true.... The
          rewards of heaven are not granted to</p>
      <p>transgressors....</p>
      <p>The eyes of Adam and Eve were indeed opened, but to what? To see their own shame and ruin, to realize that the
          garments of heavenly light which had been their protection were no longer around them as their safeguard.
          Their eyes were opened to see that nakedness was the fruit of transgression. As they heard God in the garden,
          they hid themselves from Him; for they anticipated that which till their fall they had not
          <nobr>known,—the</nobr> condemnation of God....</p>
      <p>God has declared that man’s only means of safety is entire obedience to all His words. We are not to make the
          experiment of testing the evil course, with all its results. This will bring weakness through disobedience.
          God’s plan was to give man <nobr>clear-sightedness</nobr> in all his work....</p>
      <p>There was to be <nobr>co-operation</nobr> between man and God. But this plan was greatly interfered with by
          Adam’s transgression. Satan led him to sin, and the Lord would not communicate with him after he had sinned as
          he did when he was without sin.</p>
      <p>After the fall Christ became Adam’s instructor. He acted in God’s stead toward humanity, saving the race from
          immediate death. He took upon him the ofﬁce of mediator. Adam and Eve were given a probation in which to
          return to their allegiance, and in this plan all their posterity were embraced.</p>
      <p>Without the atonement of the Son of God there could have been no communication of blessing or salvation from
          God to man. God was jealous for the honor of His law. The transgression of that law had caused a fearful
          separation between God and man. To Adam in his innocence was granted communion, direct, free, and happy, with
          his Maker. After his transgression, God would communicate to man only through Christ and angels.</p>
