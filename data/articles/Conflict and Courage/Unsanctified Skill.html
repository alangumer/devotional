      <p><strong>And Huram ﬁnished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God. 2 Chronicles
          4:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Chosen men were specially endowed by God with skill and wisdom for the construction of the wilderness
          tabernacle (Exodus <nobr>35:30-35)....</nobr> The descendants</p>
      <p>of these men inherited to a large degree the skill conferred upon their forefathers....</p>
      <p>For a time these men remained humble and unselﬁsh; but gradually, almost imperceptibly, they lost their hold
          upon God and His truth. They began to ask for higher wages because of their superior skill. In some instances
          their request was granted, but more often those asking higher wages found employment in the surrounding
          nations.... It was to these apostates that Solomon looked for a master</p>
      <p>workman to superintend the construction of the temple on Mount Moriah....</p>
      <p>This master workman, Huram, was a descendant, on his mother’s side, of Aholiab, to whom, hundreds of years
          before, God had given special wisdom for the construction of the tabernacle. Thus at the head of Solomon’s
          company of workmen there was placed an unsanctiﬁed man, who demanded large wages because of his unusual
          skill.... The baleful inﬂuences set in operation by the</p>
      <p>employment of this man of a grasping spirit, permeated all branches of the Lord’s service, and extended
          throughout Solomon’s kingdom.... Extravagance</p>
      <p>and corruption were to be seen on every hand. The poor were oppressed by the rich; the spirit of
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> in God’s service was <nobr>well-nigh</nobr> lost.</p>
      <p>Herein lies a most important lesson for God’s people <nobr>today—a</nobr> lesson that many are slow to
          learn.... Those who claim to be followers of the Master Worker,</p>
      <p>and who engage in His service as colaborers with God, are to bring into their work the exactitude and skill,
          the tact and wisdom, that the God of perfection required in the building of the earthly tabernacle. And now,
          as in that time and as in the days of Christ’s earthly ministry, devotion to God and a spirit of sacriﬁce
          should be regarded as the ﬁrst requisites of acceptable service.</p>
