    <h1>In God’s Image</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>1:26-31</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
          Genesis 1:27.</p>
      <p>After the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable life had been called into existence, man, the crowning
          work of the Creator, and the one for whom the beautiful earth had been ﬁtted up, was brought upon the stage of
          action. To him was given dominion over all that his eye could behold....</p>
      <p>God created man in His own image. Here is no mystery. There is no ground for the supposition that man was
          evolved by slow degrees of development from the lower forms of animal or vegetable life. Such teaching lowers
          the great work of the Creator to the level of man’s narrow, earthly conceptions. Men are so intent upon
          excluding God from the sovereignty of the universe that they degrade man and defraud him of the dignity of his
          origin. He who set the starry worlds on high and tinted with delicate skill the ﬂowers of the ﬁeld, who ﬁlled
          the earth and the heavens with the wonders of His power, when He came to crown His glorious work, to place one
          in the midst to stand as ruler of the fair earth, did not fail to create a being worthy of the hand that gave
          him life. The genealogy of our race, as given by inspiration, traces back its origin, not to a line of
          developing germs, mollusks, and quadrupeds, but to the great Creator. Though formed from the dust, Adam was
          “the son of God.” ...</p>
      <p>His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His
          affections were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He was holy and happy in
          bearing the image of God and in perfect obedience to His will.</p>
      <p>He [Adam] was more than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth, and was well proportioned. His features
          were perfect and beautiful.... Eve was not</p>
      <p>quite as tall as Adam. Her head reached a little above his shoulders. She, too, was noble, perfect in symmetry,
          and very beautiful.</p>
      <p>This sinless pair wore no artiﬁcial garments. They were clothed with a covering of light and glory, such as the
          angels wear.</p>
