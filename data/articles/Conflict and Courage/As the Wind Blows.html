    <h1>As the Wind Blows</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>3:1-21</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
          enter into the kingdom of God. John 3:5.</p>
      <p>Nicodemus was astonished as well as indignant at these words. He regarded himself as not only an intellectual,
          but a pious and religious man.... He could not</p>
      <p>harmonize this doctrine of conversion with his understanding of what constituted religion. He could not explain
          to his own satisfaction the science of conversion; but Jesus showed him, by a ﬁgure, that it could not be
          explained by any of his precise methods. Jesus pointed out to him the fact that he could not see the wind, yet
          he could discern its action. He might never be able to explain the process of conversion, but he would be able
          to discern its effect. He heard the sound of the wind which bloweth where it listeth, and he could see the
          result of its action. The operating agency was not revealed to view.... No human reasoning of the most</p>
      <p>learned man can deﬁne the operations of the Holy Spirit upon human minds and characters; yet they can see the
          effects upon the life and actions....</p>
      <p>He was not willing to admit truth, because he could not understand all that was connected with the operation of
          the power of God; and yet he accepted the facts of nature, although he could not explain or even comprehend
          them. Like other men of all ages, he was looking to forms and precise ceremonies as more essential to religion
          than the deep movings of the Spirit of God.</p>
      <p>We may have ﬂattered ourselves, as did Nicodemus, that our life has been upright, that our moral character is
          correct, and think that we need not humble the heart before God, like the common sinner: but when the light
          from Christ shines into our souls, we shall see how impure we are; we shall discern the selﬁshness of motive,
          the enmity against God, that has deﬁled every act of life. Then we shall know that our own righteousness is
          indeed as ﬁlthy rags, and that the blood of Christ alone can cleanse us from the deﬁlement of sin, and renew
          our hearts in His own likeness.</p>
