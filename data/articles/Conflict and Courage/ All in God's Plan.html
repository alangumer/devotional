      <p><strong>The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. Job
          28:28.</strong></p>
      <p>Joseph’s checkered life was not an accident; it was ordered of Providence. But how was he enabled to make such
          a record of ﬁrmness of character, uprightness and wisdom? It was the result of careful training in his early
          years. He had consulted duty rather than inclination; and the purity and simple trust of the boy bore fruit in
          the deeds of the man. The most brilliant talents are of no value unless they are improved; industrious habits
          and force of character must be gained by cultivation. A high moral character and ﬁne mental qualities are not
          the result of accident. God gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of them. The openings of
          Providence must be quickly discerned and eagerly seized upon.</p>
      <p>Not to the people of Egypt alone, but to all the nations connected with that powerful kingdom, God manifested
          Himself through Joseph. He desired to make him a light bearer to all peoples, and He placed him next the
          throne of the world’s greatest empire, that the heavenly illumination might extend far and near.</p>
      <p>There are few who realize the inﬂuence of the little things of life upon the development of character. Nothing
          with which we have to do is really small. The varied circumstances that we meet day by day are designed to
          test our faithfulness and to qualify us for greater trusts. By adherence to principle in the transactions of
          ordinary life, the mind becomes accustomed to hold the claims of duty above those of pleasure and inclination.
          Minds thus disciplined are not wavering between right and wrong, like the reed trembling in the wind; they are
          loyal to duty because they have trained themselves to habits of ﬁdelity and truth. By faithfulness in that
          which is least they acquire strength to be faithful in greater matters. An upright character is of greater
          worth than the gold of Ophir. Without it none can rise to an honorable eminence. But character is not
          inherited. It cannot be bought. Moral excellence and ﬁne mental qualities are not the result of accident. The
          most precious gifts are of no value unless they are improved.</p>
