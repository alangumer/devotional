    <h1>Fretting and Fussing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>10:38-42</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord answered, “Martha, Martha, you are fretting and fussing about so many things; but one thing is
          necessary. The part that Mary has chosen is best; and it shall not be taken away from her.” Luke 10:41, 42,
          N.E.B.</p>
      <p>As Christ gave His wonderful lessons, Mary sat at His feet, a reverent and devoted listener. On one occasion,
          Martha, perplexed with the care of preparing the meal, went to Christ, saying, “Lord, dost Thou not care that
          my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.” This was the time of Christ’s ﬁrst
          visit to Bethany. The Saviour and His disciples had just made the toilsome journey on foot from Jericho.
          Martha was anxious to provide for their comfort, and in her anxiety she forgot the courtesy due to her
          Guest....</p>
      <p>The “one thing” that Martha needed was a calm, devotional spirit, a deeper anxiety for knowledge concerning the
          future, immortal life, and the graces necessary for spiritual advancement. She needed less anxiety for the
          things which pass away, and more for those things which endure forever. Jesus would teach His children to
          seize every opportunity of gaining that knowledge which will make them wise unto salvation. The cause of
          Christ needs careful, energetic workers. There is a wide ﬁeld for the Marthas, with their zeal in active
          religious work. But let them ﬁrst sit with Mary at the feet of Jesus. Let diligence, promptness, and energy be
          sanctiﬁed by the grace of Christ; then the life will be an unconquerable power for good.</p>
      <p>The reason why the youth, and even those of mature years, are so easily led into temptation and sin, is that
          they do not study the word of God and meditate upon it as they should. The lack of ﬁrm, decided will power,
          which is manifest in life and character, results from neglect of the sacred instruction of God’s word. They do
          not by earnest effort direct the mind to that which would inspire pure, holy thought and divert it from that
          which is impure and untrue. There are few who choose the better part, who sit at the feet of Jesus, as did
          Mary, to learn of the divine Teacher. Few treasure His words in the heart and practice them in the life.</p>
