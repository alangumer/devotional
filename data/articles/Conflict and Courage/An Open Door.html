    <h1>An Open Door</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had
          translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. Hebrews
          11:5.</strong></p>
      <p>When we learn to walk by faith and not by feeling, we shall have help from God just when we need it, and His
          peace will come into our hearts. It was this simple life of obedience and trust that Enoch lived. If we learn
          this lesson of simple trust, ours may be the testimony that he received, that he pleased God.</p>
      <p>In every phase of your character building you are to please God. This you may do; for Enoch pleased Him though
          living in a degenerate age. And there are Enochs in this our day.</p>
      <p>For three hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity of heart, that he might be in harmony with heaven. For
          three centuries he had walked with God. Day by day he had longed for a closer union; nearer and nearer had
          grown the communion, until God took him to Himself. He had stood at the threshold of the eternal world, only a
          step between him and the land of the blest; and now the portals opened, the walk with God, so long pursued on
          earth, continued, and he passed through the gates of the holy <nobr>city,—the</nobr> ﬁrst from among men to
          enter there.</p>
      <p>With the word of God in his hands, every human being, wherever his lot in life may be cast, may have such
          companionship as he shall choose. In its pages he may hold converse with the noblest and best of the human
          race, and may listen to the voice of the Eternal as He speaks with men.... He may dwell in this world</p>
      <p>in the atmosphere of heaven, imparting to earth’s sorrowing and tempted ones thoughts of hope and longings for
          holiness; ... like him of old who walked with God, drawing nearer and nearer the threshold of the eternal
          world, until the portals shall open, and he shall enter there. He will ﬁnd himself no stranger. The voices
          that will greet him are the voices of the holy ones, who, unseen, were on earth his
          <nobr>companions—voices</nobr> that here he learned to distinguish and to love. He who through the word of God
          has lived in fellowship with heaven, will ﬁnd himself at home in heaven’s companionship.</p>
