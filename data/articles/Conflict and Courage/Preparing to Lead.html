      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>17:1-37</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>When there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the ﬂock, I went out after him, and smote him, and
          delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and
          slew him. 1 Samuel 17:34, 35, R.V.</p>
      <p>David was growing in favor with God and man. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he now set his
          heart more fully to do the will of God than ever before. He had new themes for thought. He had been in the
          court of the king and had seen the responsibilities of royalty. He had discovered some of the temptations that
          beset the soul of Saul and had penetrated some of the mysteries in the character and dealings of Israel’s ﬁrst
          king. He had seen the glory of royalty shadowed with a dark cloud of sorrow, and he knew that the household of
          Saul, in their private life, were far from happy. All these things served to bring troubled thoughts to him
          who had been anointed to be king over Israel. But while he was absorbed in deep meditation, and harassed by
          thoughts of anxiety, he turned to his harp, and called forth strains that elevated his mind to the Author of
          every good, and the dark clouds that seemed to shadow the horizon of the future were dispelled.</p>
      <p>God was teaching David lessons of trust. As Moses was trained for his work, so the Lord was ﬁtting the son of
          Jesse to become the guide of His chosen people. In his watchcare for his ﬂocks, he was gaining an appreciation
          of the care that the Great Shepherd has for the sheep of His pasture.</p>
      <p>The lonely hills and the wild ravines where David wandered with his ﬂocks were the lurking place of beasts of
          prey. Not infrequently the lion from the thickets by the Jordan, or the bear from his lair among the hills,
          came, ﬁerce with hunger, to attack the ﬂocks. According to the custom of his time, David was armed only with
          his sling and shepherd’s staff; yet he early gave proof of his strength and courage in protecting his
          charge....</p>
      <p>His experience in these matters proved the heart of David and developed in him courage and fortitude and
          faith.</p>
