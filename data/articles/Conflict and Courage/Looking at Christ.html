    <h1>Looking at Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jude 14, 15</strong></p>
      <p>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
          glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18.</p>
      <p>In the midst of a life of active labor, Enoch steadfastly maintained his communion with God. The greater and
          more pressing his labors, the more constant and earnest were his prayers. He continued to exclude himself at
          certain periods from all society. After remaining for a time among the people, laboring to beneﬁt them by
          instruction and example, he would withdraw, to spend a season in solitude, hungering and thirsting for that
          divine knowledge which God alone can impart. Communing thus with God, Enoch came more and more to reﬂect the
          divine image. His face was radiant with a holy light, even the light that shineth in the face of Jesus. As he
          came forth from these divine communings, even the ungodly beheld with awe the impress of heaven upon his
          countenance.</p>
      <p>Enoch kept the Lord ever before him.... He made Christ his constant</p>
      <p>companion. He was in the world, and performed his duties to the world; but he was ever under the inﬂuence of
          Jesus. He reﬂected Christ’s character, exhibiting the same qualities of goodness, mercy, tender compassion,
          sympathy, forbearance, meekness, humility, and love. His association with Christ day by day transformed him
          into the image of Him with whom he was so intimately connected. Day by day he was growing away from his own
          way into Christ’s way, the heavenly, the divine, in his thoughts and feelings.</p>
      <p>If we keep the Lord ever before us, allowing our hearts to go out in thanksgiving and praise to Him, we shall
          have a continual freshness in our religious life. Our prayers will take the form of a conversation with God as
          we would talk with a friend. He will speak His mysteries to us personally. Often there will come to us a
          sweet, joyful sense of the presence of Jesus. Often our hearts will burn within us as He draws nigh to commune
          with us as He did with Enoch. When this is in truth the experience of the Christian, there is seen in his life
          a simplicity, a humility, meekness, and lowliness of heart, that show to all with whom he associates that he
          has been with Jesus and learned of Him.</p>
