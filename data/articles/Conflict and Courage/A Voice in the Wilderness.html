      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>17:1-7</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Elijah the Tishbite, ... said unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall
          not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. 1 Kings 17:1.</p>
      <p>Among the mountains of Gilead, east of the Jordan, there dwelt in the days of Ahab a man of faith and prayer
          whose fearless ministry was destined to check the rapid spread of apostasy in Israel. Far removed from any
          city of renown, and occupying no high station in life, Elijah the Tishbite nevertheless entered upon his
          mission conﬁdent in God’s purpose to prepare the way before him and to give him abundant success. The word of
          faith and power was upon his lips, and his whole life was devoted to the work of reform. His was the voice of
          one crying in the wilderness to rebuke sin and press back the tide of evil. And while he came to the people as
          a reprover of sin, his message offered the balm of Gilead to the <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> souls of all who
          desired to be healed....</p>
      <p>To Elijah was entrusted the mission of delivering to Ahab Heaven’s message of judgment. He did not seek to be
          the Lord’s messenger; the word of the Lord came to him. And jealous for the honor of God’s cause, he did not
          hesitate to obey the divine summons, though to obey seemed to invite swift destruction at the hand of the
          wicked king....</p>
      <p>It was only by the exercise of strong faith in the unfailing power of God’s word that Elijah delivered his
          message. Had he not possessed implicit conﬁdence in the One whom he served, he would never have appeared
          before Ahab. On his way to Samaria, Elijah had passed by <nobr>ever-ﬂowing</nobr> streams, hills covered with
          verdure, and stately forests that seemed beyond the reach of drought. Everything on which the eye rested was
          clothed with beauty. The prophet might have wondered how the streams that had never ceased their ﬂow could
          become dry, or how those hills and valleys could be burned with drought. But he gave no place to unbelief. He
          fully believed that God would humble apostate Israel, and that through judgments they would be brought to
          repentance. The ﬁat of Heaven had gone forth; God’s word could not fail; and at the peril of his life Elijah
          fearlessly fulﬁlled his commission.</p>
