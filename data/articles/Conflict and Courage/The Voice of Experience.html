      <p><strong>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in
          the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will
          bring thee into judgment. Ecclesiastes 11:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The lesson to be learned from the life of Solomon has a special moral bearing upon the life of the aged, of
          those who are no longer climbing the mountain but are descending and facing the western sun. We expect to see
          defects in the characters of youth who are not controlled by love and faith in Jesus Christ. We see youth
          wavering between right and wrong, vacillating between ﬁxed principle and the almost overpowering current of
          evil that is bearing them off their feet to ruin. But of those of mature age we expect better things. We look
          for the character to be established, for principles to be rooted, and for them to be beyond the danger of
          pollution. But the case of Solomon is before us as a beacon of warning. When thou, aged pilgrim who hast
          fought the battles of life, thinkest that thou standest take heed lest thou fall. How, in Solomon’s case, was
          weak, vacillating character, naturally bold, ﬁrm, and determined, shaken like a reed in the wind under the
          tempter’s power! How was an old gnarled cedar of Lebanon, a sturdy oak of Bashan, bent before the blast of
          temptation! What a lesson for all who desire to save their souls to watch unto prayer continually! What a
          warning to keep the grace of Christ ever in their heart, to battle with inward corruptions and outward
          temptations!</p>
      <p>Let none venture into sin as he did, in the hope that they too may recover themselves. Sin can be indulged only
          at the peril of inﬁnite loss. But none who have fallen need give themselves up to despair. Aged men, once
          honored of God, may have deﬁled their souls, sacriﬁcing virtue on the altar of lust; but there is still hope
          for them if they repent, forsake sin, and turn to God.</p>
      <p>The misapplication of noble talents in Solomon’s case should be a warning to all. Goodness alone is true
          greatness.</p>
