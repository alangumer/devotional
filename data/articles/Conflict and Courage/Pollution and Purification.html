    <h1>Pollution and Puriﬁcation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>2:19-22</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I
          have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. 2 Kings 2:21.</p>
      <p>In casting salt into the bitter spring, Elisha taught the same spiritual lesson imparted centuries later by the
          Saviour to His disciples when He declared, “Ye are the salt of the earth.” The salt mingling with the polluted
          spring puriﬁed its waters and brought life and blessing where before had been blighting and death. When God
          compares His children to salt, He would teach them that His purpose in making them the subjects of His grace
          is that they may become agents in saving others....</p>
      <p>Salt must be mingled with the substance to which it is added; it must penetrate, infuse it, that it may be
          preserved. So it is through personal contact and association that men are reached by the saving power of the
          gospel. They are not saved as masses, but as individuals. Personal inﬂuence is a power. It is to work with the
          inﬂuence of Christ, ... and to stay the progress of the world’s corruption.... It</p>
      <p>is to uplift, to sweeten the lives and characters of others by the power of a pure example united with earnest
          faith and love....</p>
      <p>The polluted stream represents the soul that is separate from God.... Through</p>
      <p>sin, the whole human organism is deranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination corrupted; the faculties of
          the soul are degraded. There is an absence of pure religion, of heart holiness. The converting power of God
          has not wrought in transforming the character....</p>
      <p>The heart that receives the word of God is not as a pool that evaporates.... It</p>
      <p>is like a river constantly ﬂowing and, as it advances, becoming deeper and wider, until its
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> waters are spread over all the earth.... So it is with the true child</p>
      <p>of God. The religion of Christ reveals itself as a vitalizing, pervading principle, a living, working,
          spiritual energy. When the heart is opened to the heavenly inﬂuence of truth and love, these principles will
          ﬂow forth again like streams in the desert, causing fruitfulness to appear where now are barrenness and
          dearth.</p>
