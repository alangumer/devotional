      <p><strong>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the
          way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. Genesis 18:19.</strong></p>
      <p>In God’s sight, a man is just what he is in his family. The life of Abraham, the friend of God, was signalized
          by a strict regard for the word of the Lord. He cultivated home religion. The fear of God pervaded his
          household. He was the priest of his home. He looked upon his family as a sacred trust. His household numbered
          more than a thousand souls, and he directed them all, parents and children, to the divine Sovereign. He
          suffered no parental oppression on the one hand or ﬁlial disobedience on the other. By the combined inﬂuence
          of love and justice, he ruled his household in the fear of God, and the Lord bore witness to his
          faithfulness.</p>
      <p>He “will command ... his household.” There would be no sinful neglect to restrain the evil propensities of his
          children, no weak, unwise, indulgent favoritism, no yielding of his conviction of duty to the claims of
          mistaken affection. Abraham would not only give right instruction, but he would maintain the authority of just
          and righteous laws.</p>
      <p>How few there are in our day who follow this example. On the part of too many parents there is a blind and
          selﬁsh sentimentalism, which is manifested in leaving children with their unformed judgment and undisciplined
          passions, to the control of their own will. This is the worst cruelty to the youth and a great wrong to the
          world. Parental indulgence causes disorder in families and in society. It conﬁrms in the young the desire to
          follow inclination, instead of submitting to the divine requirements.</p>
      <p>Parents and children alike belong to God to be ruled by Him. By affection and authority combined, Abraham ruled
          his house. God’s word has given us rules for our guidance. These rules form the standard from which we cannot
          swerve if we would keep the way of the Lord. God’s will must be paramount. The question for us to ask is not:
          What have others done? What will my relatives think? or, What will they say of me if I pursue this course?
          but, What has God said? Neither parent nor child can truly prosper in any course excepting in the way of the
          Lord.</p>
