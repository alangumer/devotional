    <h1>Seven Short Years</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>29:1-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
          Genesis 29:20.</p>
      <p>How different his [Jacob’s] arrival from that of Abraham’s messenger nearly a hundred years before! The servant
          had come with a train of attendants riding upon camels, and with rich gifts of gold and silver; the son was a
          lonely, footsore traveler, with no possession save his staff. Like Abraham’s servant, Jacob tarried beside a
          well, and it was here that he met Rachel, Laban’s younger daughter....</p>
      <p>Though he came portionless and unattended, a few weeks showed the worth of his diligence and skill, and he was
          urged to tarry. It was arranged that he should render Laban seven years’ service for the hand of Rachel.</p>
      <p>In early times custom required the bridegroom, before the ratiﬁcation of a marriage engagement, to pay a sum of
          money or its equivalent in other property, according to his circumstances, to the father of his wife. This was
          regarded as a safeguard to the marriage relation.... But provision was made to test those who</p>
      <p>had nothing to pay for a wife. They were permitted to labor for the father whose daughter they loved, the
          length of time being regulated by the value of the dowry required. When the suitor was faithful in his
          services, and proved in other respects worthy, he obtained the daughter as his wife; and generally the dowry
          which the father had received was given her at her marriage....</p>
      <p>The ancient custom, though sometimes abused, as by Laban, was productive of good results. When the suitor was
          required to render service to secure his bride, a hasty marriage was prevented, and there was opportunity to
          test the depth of his affections, as well as his ability to provide for a family. In our time many evils
          result from pursuing an opposite course. It is often the case that persons before marriage have little
          opportunity to become acquainted with each other’s habits and disposition, and, so far as everyday life is
          concerned, they are virtually strangers when they unite their interests at the altar. Many ﬁnd, too late, that
          they are not adapted to each other, and lifelong wretchedness is the result of their union.</p>
