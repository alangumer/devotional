      <p><strong>What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. Psalm 56:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Only the sense of God’s presence can banish the fear that, for the timid child, would make life a burden. Let
          him ﬁx in his memory the promise, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
          delivereth them” (Psalm 34:7). Let him read that wonderful story of Elisha in the mountain city, and, between
          him and the hosts of armed foemen, a mighty encircling band of heavenly angels. Let him read how to Peter, in
          prison and condemned to death, God’s angel appeared; how, past the armed guards, the massive doors and great
          iron gateway with their bolts and bars, the angel led God’s servant forth in safety. Let him read of that
          scene on the sea, when to the <nobr>tempest-tossed</nobr> soldiers and seamen, worn with labor and watching
          and long fasting, Paul the prisoner, on his way to trial and execution, spoke those grand words of courage and
          hope: “Be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you.... For there stood by me</p>
      <p>this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before
          Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.” In the faith of this promise Paul assured
          his companions, “There shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.” So it came to pass. Because there
          was in that ship one man through whom God could work, the whole shipload of heathen soldiers and sailors was
          preserved. “They escaped all safe to land” (Acts <nobr>27:22-24,</nobr> 34, 44).</p>
      <p>These things were not written merely that we might read and wonder, but that the same faith which wrought in
          God’s servants of old might work in us. In no less marked a manner than He wrought then will He work now
          wherever there are hearts of faith to be channels of His power.</p>
      <p>Let the <nobr>self-distrustful,</nobr> whose lack of <nobr>self-reliance</nobr> leads them to shrink from care
          and responsibility, be taught reliance upon God. Thus many a one who otherwise would be but a cipher in the
          world, perhaps only a helpless burden, will be able to say with the apostle Paul, “I can do all things through
          Christ which strengtheneth me” (Philippians 4:13).</p>
