    <h1>Entertaining Strangers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>18:1-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Hebrews 13:2.</p>
      <p>God conferred great honor upon Abraham. Angels of heaven walked and talked with him as friend with friend. When
          judgments were about to be visited upon Sodom, the fact was not hidden from him, and he became an intercessor
          with God for sinners. His interview with the angels presents also a beautiful example of hospitality.</p>
      <p>In the records of Genesis we see the patriarch at the hot summer noontide resting in his tent door under the
          shadow of the oaks of Mamre. Three travelers are passing near. They make no appeal for hospitality, solicit no
          favor; but Abraham does not permit them to go on their way unrefreshed. He is a man full of years, a man of
          dignity and wealth, one highly honored, and accustomed to command; yet on seeing these strangers he “ran to
          meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground.” Addressing the leader he said: “My Lord,
          if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant” (Genesis 18:2, 3). With
          his own hands he brought water that they might wash the dust of travel from their feet. He himself selected
          their food; while they were at rest under the cooling shade, Sarah his wife made ready for their
          entertainment, and Abraham stood respectfully beside them while they partook of his hospitality. This kindness
          he showed them simply as wayfarers, passing strangers, who might never come his way again. But, the
          entertainment over, his guests stood revealed. He had ministered not only to heavenly angels, but to their
          glorious Commander, his Creator, Redeemer, and King. And to Abraham the counsels of heaven were opened, and he
          was called “the friend of God.” ...</p>
      <p>The privilege granted Abraham and Lot is not denied to us. By showing hospitality to God’s children we, too,
          may receive His angels into our dwellings. Even in our day, angels in human form enter the homes of men and
          are entertained by them. And Christians who live in the light of God’s countenance are always accompanied by
          unseen angels, and these holy beings leave behind them a blessing in our homes.</p>
