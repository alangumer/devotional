    <h1>A Slave Mother</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>2:1-10</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old he will not depart from it. Proverbs 22:6.</p>
      <p>Jochebed was a woman and a slave. Her lot in life was humble, her burden heavy. But through no other woman,
          save Mary of Nazareth, has the world received greater blessing. Knowing that her child [Moses] must soon pass
          beyond her care, to the guardianship of those who knew not God, she the more earnestly endeavored to link his
          soul with heaven.</p>
      <p>She endeavored to imbue his mind with the fear of God and the love of truth and justice, and earnestly prayed
          that he might be preserved from every corrupting inﬂuence. She showed him the folly and sin of idolatry, and
          early taught him to bow down and pray to the living God, who alone could hear him and help him in every
          emergency.</p>
      <p>She kept the boy as long as she could, but was obliged to give him up when he was about twelve years old. From
          his humble cabin home he was taken to the royal palace, to the daughter of Pharaoh, “and he became her son.”
          Yet even here he did not lose the impressions received in childhood. The lessons learned at his mother’s side
          could not be forgotten. They were a shield from the pride, the inﬁdelity, and the vice that ﬂourished amid the
          splendor of the court.</p>
      <p>How <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> in its results was the inﬂuence of that one Hebrew woman, and she an exile and a
          slave! The whole future life of Moses, the great mission which he fulﬁlled as the leader of Israel, testiﬁes
          to the importance of the work of the Christian mother. There is no other work that can equal this. To a very
          great extent the mother holds in her own hands the destiny of her children.... She</p>
      <p>is sowing seed that will spring up and bear fruit, either for good or for evil. She has not to paint a form of
          beauty upon canvas or to chisel it from marble, but to impress upon a human soul the image of the
          divine....</p>
      <p>Let every mother feel that her moments are priceless; her work will be tested in the solemn day of
          accounts.</p>
