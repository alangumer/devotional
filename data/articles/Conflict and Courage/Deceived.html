    <h1>Deceived!</h1>

      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>3:1-6</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? Genesis 3:1.</p>
      <p>To man, the crowning work of creation, God has given power to understand His requirements, to comprehend the
          justice and beneﬁcence of His law, and its sacred claims upon him; and of man unswerving obedience is
          required.</p>
      <p>Like the angels, the dwellers in Eden had been placed upon probation; their happy estate could be retained only
          on condition of ﬁdelity to the Creator’s law. They could obey and live, or disobey and perish....</p>
      <p>The angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself from her husband while occupied in their daily
          labor in the garden; with him she would be in less danger from temptation than if she were alone. But absorbed
          in her pleasing task, she unconsciously wandered from his side.... She soon found</p>
      <p>herself gazing with mingled curiosity and admiration upon the forbidden tree. The fruit was very beautiful, and
          she questioned with herself why God had withheld it from them. Now was the tempter’s opportunity. As if he
          were able to discern the workings of her mind, he addressed her: “Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of
          every tree of the garden?” ...</p>
      <p>The tempter intimated that the divine warning was not to be actually fulﬁlled; it was designed merely to
          intimidate them....</p>
      <p>Such has been Satan’s work from the days of Adam to the present, and he has pursued it with great success. He
          tempts men to distrust God’s love and to doubt His wisdom. He is constantly seeking to excite a spirit of
          irreverent curiosity, a restless, inquisitive desire to penetrate the secrets of divine wisdom and power. In
          their efforts to search out what God has been pleased to withhold, multitudes overlook the truths which He has
          revealed, and which are essential to salvation....</p>
      <p>Eve really believed the words of Satan, but her belief did not save her from the penalty of sin. She
          disbelieved the words of God, and this was what led to her fall. In the judgment men will not be condemned
          because they conscientiously believed a lie, but because they did not believe the truth, because they
          neglected the opportunity of learning what is truth.</p>
