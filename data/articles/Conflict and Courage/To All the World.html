      <p><strong>Acts 10</strong></p>
      <p>Peter began: “I now see how true it is that God has no favourites, but that in every nation the man who is
          godfearing and does what is right is acceptable to him.” Acts 10:34, 35, N.E.B.</p>
      <p>Peter ... was called by God to take the gospel to Cornelius....</p>
      <p>As yet none of the disciples had preached the gospel to the Gentiles. In their minds the middle wall of
          partition, broken down by the death of Christ, still existed, and their labors had been conﬁned to the Jews,
          for they had looked upon the Gentiles as excluded from the blessings of the gospel. Now the Lord was seeking
          to teach Peter the <nobr>world-wide</nobr> extent of the divine plan....</p>
      <p>How carefully the Lord worked to overcome the prejudice against the Gentiles that had been so ﬁrmly ﬁxed in
          Peter’s mind by his Jewish training! By the vision of the sheet and its contents He sought to divest the
          apostle’s mind of this prejudice and to teach the important truth that in heaven there is no respect of
          persons; that Jew and Gentile are alike precious in God’s sight; that through Christ the heathen may be made
          partakers of the blessings and privileges of the gospel....</p>
      <p>It was with reluctance at every step that he [Peter] undertook the duty laid upon him but he dared not
          disobey.... As Peter pointed those present [Cornelius</p>
      <p>and his kinsmen and friends] to Jesus as the sinner’s only hope, he himself understood more fully the meaning
          of the vision he had seen, and his heart glowed with the spirit of the truth that he was presenting....</p>
      <p>When the brethren in Judea heard that Peter had gone to the house of a Gentile and preached to those assembled,
          they were surprised and offended. They feared that such a course, which looked to them presumptuous, would
          have the effect of counteracting his own teaching....</p>
      <p>Peter laid the whole matter before them.... Convinced that Peter’s course was</p>
      <p>in direct fulﬁllment of the plan of God, and that their prejudices and exclusiveness were utterly contrary to
          the spirit of the gospel, they gloriﬁed God, saying, “Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
          unto life.”</p>
