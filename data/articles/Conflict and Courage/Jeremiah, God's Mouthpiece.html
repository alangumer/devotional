    <h1>Jeremiah, God’s Mouthpiece</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. Lamentations
          3:26.</strong></p>
      <p>Among those who had hoped for a permanent spiritual revival as the result of the reformation under Josiah was
          Jeremiah, called of God to the prophetic ofﬁce while still a youth....</p>
      <p>In the youthful Jeremiah, God saw one who would be true to his trust and who would stand for the right against
          great opposition.... “Say not, I am a child,” the</p>
      <p>Lord bade His chosen messenger; “for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee
          thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee.” ...</p>
      <p>For forty years Jeremiah was to stand before the nation as a witness for truth and righteousness. In a time of
          unparalleled apostasy he was to exemplify in life and character the worship of the only true God. During the
          terrible sieges of Jerusalem he was to be the mouthpiece of Jehovah.</p>
      <p>Naturally of a timid and shrinking disposition, Jeremiah longed for the peace and quite of a life of
          retirement, where he need not witness the continued impenitence of his beloved nation. His heart was wrung
          with anguish over the ruin wrought by sin....</p>
      <p>The experiences through which Jeremiah passed in the days of his youth and also in the later years of his
          ministry, taught him the lesson that “the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to
          direct his steps.” He learned to pray, “O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou
          bring me to nothing” (Jeremiah 10:23, 24).</p>
      <p>When called to drink of the cup of tribulation and sorrow, and when tempted in his misery to say, “My strength
          and my hope is perished from the Lord,” he recalled the providences of God in his behalf and triumphantly
          exclaimed, “It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.... The
          Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</p>
