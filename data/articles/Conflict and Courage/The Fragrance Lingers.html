      <p><strong>Mark <nobr>14:1-11</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she
          hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. Mark 14:9.</p>
      <p>The fragrant gift which Mary had thought to lavish upon the dead body of the Saviour she poured upon His living
          form. At the burial its sweetness could only have pervaded the tomb; now it gladdened His heart with the
          assurance of her faith and love. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus offered not their gift of love to Jesus in
          His life. With bitter tears they brought their costly spices for His cold, unconscious form. The women who
          bore spices to the tomb found their errand in vain, for He had risen. But Mary, pouring out her love upon the
          Saviour while He was conscious of her devotion, was anointing Him for the burial. And as He went down into the
          darkness of His great trial, He carried with Him the memory of that deed, an earnest of the love that would be
          His from His redeemed ones forever.</p>
      <p>Many there are who bring their precious gifts for the dead.... Tenderness,</p>
      <p>appreciation, devotion, all are lavished upon one who sees not nor hears. Had these words been spoken when the
          weary spirit needed them so much, when the ear could hear and the heart could feel, how precious would have
          been their fragrance!...</p>
      <p>Christ told Mary the meaning of her act.... He said, “she did it for my burial.”</p>
      <p>As the alabaster box was broken, and ﬁlled the whole house with its fragrance, so Christ was to die, His body
          was to be broken; but He was to rise from the tomb, and the fragrance of His life was to ﬁll the earth....
          Looking into the future,</p>
      <p>the Saviour spoke with certainty concerning His gospel. It was to be preached throughout the world. And as far
          as the gospel extended, Mary’s gift would shed its fragrance, and hearts would be blessed through her
          unstudied act. Kingdoms would rise and fall; the names of monarchs and conquerors would be forgotten; but this
          woman’s deed would be immortalized upon the pages of sacred history. Until time should be no more, that broken
          alabaster box would tell the story of the abundant love of God for a fallen race.</p>
