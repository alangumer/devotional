    <h1>To God be the Glory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord’s name is to be praised. Psalm
          113:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The Bible has little to say in praise of men. Little space is given to recounting the virtues of even the best
          men who have ever lived. This silence is not without purpose; it is not without a lesson. All the good
          qualities that men possess are the gift of God; their good deeds are performed by the grace of God through
          Christ. Since they owe all to God the glory of whatever they are or do belongs to Him alone; they are but
          instruments in His hands. More than <nobr>this—as</nobr> all the lessons of Bible history
          <nobr>teach—it</nobr> is a perilous thing to praise or exalt men; for if one comes to lose sight of his entire
          dependence on God, and to trust to his own strength, he is sure to fall. Man is contending with foes who are
          stronger than he.... It is impossible for us in our own strength to maintain the conﬂict;</p>
      <p>and whatever diverts the mind from God, whatever leads to <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> or to
          <nobr>self-dependence,</nobr> is surely preparing the way for our overthrow. The tenor of the Bible is to
          inculcate distrust of human power and to encourage trust in divine power.</p>
      <p>The truly converted soul is illuminated from on high.... His words, his</p>
      <p>motives, his actions, may be misinterpreted and falsiﬁed; but he does not mind it because he has greater
          interests at stake.... He is not ambitious for display; he</p>
      <p>does not crave the praise of men. His hope is in heaven, and he keeps straight on, with his eye ﬁxed on Jesus.
          He does right because it is right.</p>
      <p>By their good works, Christ’s followers are to bring glory, not to themselves, but to Him through whose grace
          and power they have wrought. It is through the Holy Spirit that every good work is accomplished, and the
          Spirit is given to glorify, not the receiver, but the Giver. When the light of Christ is shining in the soul,
          the lips will be ﬁlled with praise and thanksgiving to God. Your prayers, your performance of duty, your
          benevolence, your <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> will not be the theme of your thought or conversation. Jesus will
          be magniﬁed, self will be hidden, and Christ will appear as all in all.</p>
