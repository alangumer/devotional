    <h1>Apprenticed to Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Mark <nobr>1:16-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become ﬁshers of men. And straightway they
          forsook their nets, and followed him. Mark 1:17, 18.</p>
      <p>They were humble and unlearned men, those ﬁshers of Galilee; but Christ, the light of the world, was abundantly
          able to qualify them for the position for which He had chosen them. The Saviour did not despise education; for
          when controlled by the love of God, and devoted to His service, intellectual culture is a blessing. But He
          passed by the wise men of His time, because they were so <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr> that they could not
          sympathize with suffering humanity, and become colaborers with the man of Nazareth. In their bigotry they
          scorned to be taught by Christ. The Lord Jesus seeks the <nobr>co-operation</nobr> of those who will become
          unobstructed channels for the communion of His grace....</p>
      <p>Jesus chose unlearned ﬁshermen because they had not been schooled in the traditions and erroneous customs of
          their time. They were men of native ability, and they were humble and <nobr>teachable,—men</nobr> whom He
          could educate for His work. In the common walks of life there is many a man patiently treading the round of
          daily toil, unconscious that he possesses powers which, if called into action, would raise him to an equality
          with the world’s most honored men. The touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse those dormant faculties.
          It was such men that Jesus called to be His colaborers; and He gave them the advantage of association with
          Himself. Never had the world’s great men such a teacher. When the disciples came forth from the Saviour’s
          training, they were no longer ignorant and uncultured. They had become like Him in mind and character, and men
          took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.</p>
      <p>He who called the ﬁshermen of Galilee is still calling men to His service. And He is just as willing to
          manifest His power through us as through the ﬁrst disciples. However imperfect and sinful we may be, the Lord
          holds out to us the offer of partnership with Himself, of apprenticeship to Christ. He invites us to come
          under the divine instruction, that, uniting with Christ, we may work the works of God.</p>
