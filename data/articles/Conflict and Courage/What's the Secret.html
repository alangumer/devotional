    <h1>What’s the Secret?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Judges <nobr>16:4-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth. Judges 16:6.</p>
      <p>The Israelites made Samson judge, and he ruled Israel for twenty years. But one wrong step prepares the way for
          another.... He continued to seek those</p>
      <p>sensuous pleasures that were luring him to ruin. “He loved a woman in the valley of Sorek,” not far from his
          own birthplace. Her name was Delilah, “the consumer.” ... The Philistines kept a vigilant watch over the
          movements of their enemy, and when he degraded himself by this new attachment, they determined, through
          Delilah, to accomplish his ruin.</p>
      <p>A deputation consisting of one leading man from each of the Philistine provinces was sent to the vale of Sorek.
          They dared not attempt to seize him while in possession of his great strength, but it was their purpose to
          learn, if possible, the secret of his power. They therefore bribed Delilah to discover and reveal it.</p>
      <p>As the betrayer plied Samson with her questions, he deceived her by declaring that the weakness of other men
          would come upon him if certain processes were tried. When she put the matter to the test, the cheat was
          discovered. Then she accused him of falsehood, saying, “How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is
          not with me?” ... Three times Samson had the clearest evidence that the Philistines had leagued with his
          charmer to destroy him; but when her purpose failed, she treated the matter as a jest, and he blindly banished
          fear.</p>
      <p>In the society of this enchantress, the judge of Israel squandered precious hours that should have been
          sacredly devoted to the welfare of his people. But the blinding passions which make even the strongest weak,
          had gained control of reason and of conscience....</p>
      <p>Samson’s infatuation seems almost incredible. At ﬁrst he was not so wholly enthralled as to reveal the secret;
          but he had deliberately walked into the net of the betrayer of souls, and its meshes were drawing close about
          him at every step.</p>
