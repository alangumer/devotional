    <h1>As a Little Child</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>3:4-15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I am but a little child.... Give therefore thy servant an understanding</p>
      <p>heart to judge thy people. 1 Kings 3:7, 9.</p>
      <p>The language used by Solomon while praying to God before the ancient altar at Gibeon reveals his humility and
          his strong desire to honor God. He realized that without divine aid he was as helpless as a little child to
          fulﬁll the responsibilities resting on him. He knew that he lacked discernment, and it was a sense of his
          great need that led him to seek God for wisdom. In his heart there was no selﬁsh aspiration for a knowledge
          that would exalt him above others. He desired to discharge faithfully the duties devolving upon him, and he
          chose the gift that would be the means of causing his reign to bring glory to God. Solomon was never so rich
          or so wise or so truly great as when he confessed, “I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come
          in.”</p>
      <p>Those who today occupy positions of trust should seek to learn the lesson taught by Solomon’s prayer. The
          higher the position a man occupies, the greater the responsibility that he has to bear, the wider will be the
          inﬂuence that he exerts and the greater his need of dependence on God. Ever should he remember that with the
          call to work comes the call to walk circumspectly before his fellow men. He is to stand before God in the
          attitude of a learner. Position does not give holiness of character. It is by honoring God and obeying His
          commands that a man is made truly great.</p>
      <p>Our petitions to God should not proceed from hearts that are ﬁlled with selﬁsh aspirations. God exhorts us to
          choose those gifts that will redound to His glory. He would have us choose the heavenly instead of the
          earthly. He throws open before us the possibilities and advantages of a heavenly commerce. He gives
          encouragement to our loftiest aims, security to our choicest treasure. When the worldly possession is swept
          away, the believer will rejoice in his heavenly treasure, the riches that cannot be lost in any earthly
          disaster.</p>
