    <h1>Misplaced Love</h1>

      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>4:14-16;</nobr> Exodus <nobr>27-31</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. Psalm 105:26.</p>
      <p>Aaron was a man of amiable disposition, whom God selected to stand with Moses and speak for him.... God might
          have chosen Aaron as leader; but He</p>
      <p>who is acquainted with hearts, who understands character, knew that Aaron was yielding and lacked moral courage
          to stand in defense of the right under all circumstances, irrespective of consequences. Aaron’s desire to have
          the good will of the people sometimes led him to commit great wrongs.... The same lack</p>
      <p>of ﬁrmness for the right in his family resulted in the death of two of his sons....</p>
      <p>Nadab and Abihu failed to reverence the command of God to offer sacred ﬁre upon their censers with the incense
          before Him....</p>
      <p>Here is seen the result of loose discipline. As these sons of Aaron had not been educated to respect and
          reverence the commands of their father, as they disregarded parental authority, they did not realize the
          necessity of explicitly following the requirements of God.... Contrary to God’s express direction, they</p>
      <p>dishonored Him by offering common instead of sacred ﬁre. God visited them with His wrath; ﬁre went forth from
          His presence and destroyed them.</p>
      <p>Aaron bore his severe afﬂiction with patience and humble submission. Sorrow and keen agony wrung his soul. He
          was convicted of his neglect of duty. He was priest of the most high God, to make atonement for the sins of
          the people. He was priest of his household, yet he had been inclined to pass over the folly of his children.
          He had neglected his duty to train and educate them to obedience, <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and reverence for
          parental authority. Through feelings of misplaced indulgence, he failed to mold their characters with high
          reverence for eternal things. Aaron did not see, any more than many Christian parents now see, that his
          misplaced love and the indulgence of his children in wrong was preparing them for the certain displeasure of
          God.... His gentle remonstrance, without a</p>
      <p>ﬁrm exercise of parental restraint, and his imprudent tenderness toward his sons were cruelty in the
          extreme.</p>
