    <h1>God or Idols?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>6:1-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.... They that</p>
      <p>make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. Psalm <nobr>115:4-8.</nobr></p>
      <p>In the days of Noah a double curse was resting upon the earth in consequence of Adam’s transgression and of the
          murder committed by Cain. Yet this had not greatly changed the face of nature.... The human race yet retained
          much of its</p>
      <p>early vigor. But a few generations had passed since Adam had access to the tree which was to prolong life; and
          man’s existence was still measured by centuries. Had that <nobr>long-lived</nobr> people with their rare
          powers to plan and execute, devoted themselves to the service of God, they would have made their Creator’s
          name a praise in the earth.... But they failed to do this....</p>
      <p>Not desiring to retain God in their knowledge, they soon came to deny His existence. They adored nature in
          place of the God of nature.... Extensive groves,</p>
      <p>that retained their foliage throughout the year, were dedicated to the worship of false gods.... Men put God
          out of their knowledge and worshiped the creatures of</p>
      <p>their own imagination; and as the result, they became more and more debased. The men of that generation were
          not all, in the fullest acceptation of the term,</p>
      <p>idolaters. Many professed to be worshipers of God. They claimed that their idols were representations of the
          Deity and that through them the people could obtain a clearer conception of the divine Being. This class were
          foremost in rejecting the preaching of Noah. As they endeavored to represent God by material objects, their
          minds were blinded to His majesty and power; they ceased to realize the holiness of His character, or the
          sacred, unchanging nature of His requirements.</p>
      <p>Man will rise no higher than his conceptions of truth, purity, and holiness. If the mind is never exalted above
          the level of humanity, if it is not uplifted by faith to contemplate inﬁnite wisdom and love, the man will be
          constantly sinking lower and lower. The worshipers of false gods clothed their deities with human attributes
          and passions, and thus their standard of character was degraded to the likeness of sinful humanity.</p>
