      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>13:1-6</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. 1 Kings
          13:4.</p>
      <p>Jeroboam was ﬁlled with a spirit of deﬁance against God and attempted to restrain the one who had delivered the
          message. In wrath “he put forth his hand from the altar” and cried out, “Lay hold on him.” His impetuous act
          met with swift rebuke. The hand outstretched against the messenger of Jehovah suddenly became powerless and
          withered, and could not be withdrawn.</p>
      <p><nobr>Terror-stricken,</nobr> the king appealed to the prophet to intercede with God in his behalf.... “And the
          man of God besought the Lord, and the king’s hand was</p>
      <p>restored him again, and became as it was before.”</p>
      <p>Vain had been Jeroboam’s effort to invest with solemnity the dedication of a strange altar, respect for which
          would have led to disrespect for the worship of Jehovah in the temple at Jerusalem. By the message of the
          prophet, the king of Israel should have been led to repent and to renounce his wicked purposes, which were
          turning the people away from the true worship of God. But he hardened his heart and determined to follow a way
          of his own choosing....</p>
      <p>The Lord seeks to save, not to destroy. He delights in the rescue of sinners. “As I live, saith the Lord God, I
          have no pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel 33:11). By warnings and entreaties He calls the wayward
          to cease from their <nobr>evil-doing</nobr> and to turn to Him and live. He gives His chosen messengers a holy
          boldness, that those who hear may fear and be brought to repentance. How ﬁrmly the man of God rebuked the
          king! And this ﬁrmness was essential; in no other way could the existing evils have been rebuked. The Lord
          gave His servant boldness, that an abiding impression might be made on those who heard. The messengers of the
          Lord are never to fear the face of man, but are to stand unﬂinchingly for the right. So long as they put their
          trust in God, they need not fear; for He who gives them their commission gives them also the assurance of His
          protecting care.</p>
