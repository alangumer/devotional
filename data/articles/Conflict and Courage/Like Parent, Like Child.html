    <h1>Like Parent, Like Child</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My son, keep your father’s commandment, and forsake not your mother’s teaching. Proverbs 6:20,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>What the parents are, that, to a great extent, the children will be. The physical conditions of the parents,
          their dispositions and appetites, their mental and moral tendencies, are, to a greater or less degree,
          reproduced in their children.</p>
      <p>The nobler the aims, the higher the mental and spiritual endowments, and the better developed the physical
          power of the parents, the better will be the life equipment they give their children. In cultivating that
          which is best in themselves, parents are exerting an inﬂuence to mold society and to uplift future
          generations.</p>
      <p>Fathers and mothers need to understand their responsibility. The world is full of snares for the feet of the
          young.... They cannot discern the hidden dangers or</p>
      <p>the fearful ending of the path that seems to them the way of happiness....</p>
      <p>Even before the birth of the child, the preparation should begin that will enable it to ﬁght successfully the
          battle against evil.</p>
      <p>Especially does responsibility rest upon the mother. She, by whose lifeblood the child is nourished and its
          physical frame built up, imparts to it also mental and spiritual inﬂuences that tend to the shaping of mind
          and character....</p>
      <p>It was Hannah, the woman of prayer and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> and heavenly inspiration, who gave birth to
          Samuel, the <nobr>heaven-instructed</nobr> child, the incorruptible judge, the founder of Israel’s sacred
          schools.</p>
      <p>Would that every mother could realize how great are her duties and her responsibilities, and how great will be
          the reward of faithfulness. The mother’s daily inﬂuence upon her children is preparing them for everlasting
          life or eternal death. She exercises in her home a power more decisive than the minister in the desk, or even
          the king upon his throne.</p>
