    <h1>One Sin Leads to Another</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Samuel 11</strong></p>
      <p>The thing that David had done displeased the Lord. 2 Samuel 11:27. When in ease and <nobr>self-security</nobr>
          he let go his hold upon God, David yielded</p>
      <p>to Satan and brought upon his soul the stain of guilt. He, the <nobr>Heaven-appointed</nobr> leader of the
          nation, chosen by God to execute His law, himself trampled upon its precepts. He who should have been a terror
          to evildoers, by his own act strengthened their hands.</p>
      <p>Amid the perils of his earlier life David in conscious integrity could trust his case with God. The Lord’s hand
          had guided him safely past the unnumbered snares that had been laid for his feet. But now, guilty and
          unrepentant, he did not ask help and guidance from Heaven, but sought to extricate himself from the dangers in
          which sin had involved him. Bathsheba, whose fatal beauty had proved a snare to the king, was the wife of
          Uriah the Hittite, one of David’s bravest and most faithful ofﬁcers. None could foresee what would be the
          result should the crime become known....</p>
      <p>Every effort which David made to conceal his guilt proved unavailing.... In his</p>
      <p>desperation he was hurried on to add murder to adultery. He who had compassed the destruction of Saul was
          seeking to lead David also to ruin. Though the temptations were different, they were alike in leading to
          transgression of God’s law....</p>
      <p>Uriah was made the bearer of his own death warrant. A letter sent by his hand to Joab from the king commanded,
          “Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and
          die.” Joab, already stained with the guilt of one wanton murder, did not hesitate to obey the king’s
          instructions, and Uriah fell by the sword of the children of Ammon....</p>
      <p>He whose tender conscience and high sense of honor would not permit him, even when in peril of his life, to put
          forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed, had so fallen that he could wrong and murder one of his most
          faithful and most valiant soldiers, and hope to enjoy undisturbed the reward of his sin. Alas! how had the ﬁne
          gold become dim! how had the most ﬁne gold changed!</p>
