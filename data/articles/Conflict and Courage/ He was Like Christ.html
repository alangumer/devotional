    <h1>He was Like Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength.
          Genesis 49:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>The life of Joseph illustrates the life of Christ. It was envy that moved the brothers of Joseph to sell him as
          a slave; they hoped to prevent him from becoming greater than themselves. And when he was carried to Egypt,
          they ﬂattered themselves that they were to be no more troubled with his dreams, that they had removed all
          possibility of their fulﬁllment. But their own course was overruled by God to bring about the very event that
          they designed to hinder. So the Jewish priests and elders were jealous of Christ, fearing that He would
          attract the attention of the people from them. They put Him to death, to prevent Him from becoming king, but
          they were thus bringing about this very result.</p>
      <p>Joseph, through his bondage in Egypt, became a savior to his father’s family; yet this fact did not lessen the
          guilt of his brothers. So the cruciﬁxion of Christ by His enemies made Him the Redeemer of mankind, the
          Saviour of the fallen race, and Ruler over the whole world: but the crime of His murderers was just as heinous
          as though God’s providential hand had not controlled events for His own glory and the good of man.</p>
      <p>As Joseph was sold to the heathen by his own brothers, so Christ was sold to His bitterest enemies by one of
          His disciples. Joseph was falsely accused and thrust into prison because of his virtue: so Christ was despised
          and rejected because His righteous, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> life was a rebuke to sin; and though guilty of
          no wrong, He was condemned upon the testimony of false witnesses. And Joseph’s patience and meekness under
          injustice and oppression, his ready forgiveness and noble benevolence toward his unnatural brothers, represent
          the Saviour’s uncomplaining endurance of the malice and abuse of wicked men, and His forgiveness, not only of
          His murderers, but of all who have come to Him confessing their sins and seeking a pardon.</p>
      <p>He who receives Christ by living faith ... has a living connection with God....</p>
      <p>He carries with him the atmosphere of heaven, which is the grace of God, a treasure that the world cannot buy.
          He who is in living connection with God may be in humble stations, yet his moral worth is as precious as was
          that of Joseph.</p>
