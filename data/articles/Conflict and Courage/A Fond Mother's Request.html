    <h1>A Fond Mother’s Request</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>20:20-28</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with
          my Father in his throne. Revelation 3:21.</p>
      <p>James and John presented through their mother a petition requesting that they might be permitted to occupy the
          highest positions of honor in Christ’s kingdom. Notwithstanding Christ’s repeated instruction concerning the
          nature of His kingdom, these young disciples still cherished the hope for a Messiah who would take His throne
          and kingly power in accordance with the desires of men....</p>
      <p>But the Saviour answered, “Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and
          to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” They recalled His mysterious words pointing to trial
          and suffering, yet answered conﬁdently, “We are able.” They would count it highest honor to prove their
          loyalty by sharing all that was to befall their Lord.</p>
      <p>“Ye shall drink indeed of My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,” Christ
          declared.... James and John were to be sharers with their</p>
      <p>Master in <nobr>suffering—the</nobr> one, destined to <nobr>swift-coming</nobr> death by the sword; the other,
          longest of all the disciples to follow his Master in labor and reproach and persecution. “But to sit on my
          right hand, and on my left,” He continued, “is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is
          prepared of my Father.”</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>In the kingdom of God, position is not gained through favoritism. It is not earned, nor is it received through
          an arbitrary bestowal. It is the result of character. The crown and the throne are the tokens of a condition
          <nobr>attained—tokens</nobr> of <nobr>self-conquest</nobr> through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who has drunk most deeply of His spirit of
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr><nobr>love,—love</nobr> that “vaunteth not itself, ... seeketh not her own, is not
          easily provoked, thinketh no <nobr>evil,”—love</nobr> that moves the disciple, as it moved our Lord, to give
          all, to live and labor and sacriﬁce even unto death, for the saving of humanity.</p>
