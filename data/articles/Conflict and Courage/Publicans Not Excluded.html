    <h1>Publicans Not Excluded</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>9:9-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For I desired mercy, and not sacriﬁce; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. Hosea 6:6.</p>
      <p>The calling of Matthew to be one of Christ’s disciples excited great indignation. For a religious teacher to
          choose a publican as one of his immediate attendants was an offense against the religious, social, and
          national customs.</p>
      <p>In his grateful humility, Matthew desired to show his appreciation of the honor bestowed upon him; and, calling
          together those who had been his associates in business, in pleasure, and in sin, he made a great feast for the
          Saviour. If Jesus would call him, who was so sinful and unworthy, He would surely accept his former
          companions, who were, thought Matthew, far more deserving than himself. Matthew had a great longing that they
          should share the beneﬁts of the mercies and grace of Christ. He desired them to know that Christ did not
          ...</p>
      <p>despise and hate the publicans and sinners. He wanted them to know Christ as the blessed Saviour....</p>
      <p>Jesus never refused an invitation to such a feast. The object ever before Him was to sow in the hearts of His
          hearers the seeds of <nobr>truth—through</nobr> His winning conversation to draw hearts to Himself. In His
          every act Christ had a purpose, and the lesson which He gave on this occasion was timely and appropriate. By
          this act He declared that even publicans and sinners were not excluded from His presence....</p>
      <p>The Pharisees beheld Christ sitting and eating with publicans and sinners....</p>
      <p>These <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> men, who felt no need of help, could not appreciate the work of Christ. They
          placed themselves where they could not accept the salvation which He came to bring. They would not come unto
          Him that they might have life. The poor publicans and sinners felt their need of help, and they accepted the
          instruction and aid which they knew Christ was able to give them.</p>
      <p>To Matthew himself the example of Jesus at the feast was a constant lesson. The despised publican became one of
          the most devoted evangelists, in his own ministry following closely in his Master’s steps.</p>
