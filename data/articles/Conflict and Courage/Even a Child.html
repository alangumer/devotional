    <h1>“Even a Child”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>5:1-4</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little
          maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife. 2 Kings 5:2.</p>
      <p>A slave, far from her home, this little maid was nevertheless one of God’s witnesses, unconsciously fulﬁlling
          the purpose for which God had chosen Israel as His people. As she ministered in that heathen home, her
          sympathies were aroused in behalf of her master; and, remembering the wonderful miracles of healing wrought
          through Elisha, she said to her mistress, “Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he
          would recover him of his leprosy.” She knew that the power of Heaven was with Elisha, and she believed that by
          this power Naaman could be healed.</p>
      <p>The conduct of the captive maid, the way that she bore herself in that heathen home, is a strong witness to the
          power of early home training. There is no higher trust than that committed to fathers and mothers in the care
          and training of their children. Parents have to do with the very foundations of habit and character. By their
          example and teaching, the future of their children is largely decided.</p>
      <p>Happy are the parents whose lives are a true reﬂection of the divine, so that the promises and commands of God
          awaken in the child gratitude and reverence; the parents ... who by teaching the child to love and trust and
          obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and obey his Father in heaven. Parents who impart to the child
          such a gift have endowed him with a treasure more precious than the wealth of all the ages, a treasure as
          enduring as eternity.</p>
      <p>We know not in what line our children may be called to serve. They may spend their lives within the circle of
          the home; they may engage in life’s common vocations, or go as teachers of the gospel to heathen lands; but
          all are alike called to be missionaries for God, ministers of mercy to the world.</p>
      <p>He who sent ... the little Israelitish maiden to the help of Naaman, the Syrian captain, sends men and women
          and youth today as His representatives to those in need of divine help and guidance.</p>
