      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>17:28-37</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>David said ..., The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will
          deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee. 1
          Samuel 17:37.</p>
      <p>When David saw that all Israel were ﬁlled with fear, and learned that the Philistine’s deﬁance was hurled at
          them day after day, without arousing a champion to silence the boaster, his spirit was stirred within him. He
          was ﬁred with zeal to preserve the honor of the living God and the credit of His people.</p>
      <p>David, in his humility and zeal for God and his people, proposed to meet this boaster. Saul consented and had
          his own kingly armor placed upon David. But he would not consent to wear it. He laid off the king’s armor, for
          he had not proved it. He had proved God and, in trusting in Him, had gained special victories. To put on
          Saul’s armor would give the impression that he was a warrior, when he was only little David who tended the
          sheep. He did not mean that any credit be given to the armor of Saul, for his trust was in the Lord God of
          Israel.</p>
      <p>Choosing ﬁve smooth stones out of the brook, he put them in his bag, and, with his sling in his hand, drew near
          to the Philistine. The giant strode boldly forward, expecting to meet the mightiest of the warriors of Israel.
          His <nobr>armor-bearer</nobr> walked before him, and he looked as if nothing could withstand him. As he came
          nearer to David he saw but a stripling, called a boy because of his youth. David’s countenance was ruddy with
          health, and his <nobr>well-knit</nobr> form, unprotected by armor, was displayed to advantage; yet between its
          youthful outline and the massive proportions of the Philistine, there was a marked contrast.</p>
      <p>Goliath was ﬁlled with amazement and anger. “Am I a dog,” he exclaimed, “that thou comest to me with staves?”
          Then he poured upon David the most terrible curses by all the gods of his knowledge. He cried in derision,
          “Come to me, and I will give thy ﬂesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the ﬁeld.</p>
