    <h1>The Race Before Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Corinthians <nobr>9:24-27</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race
          that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and ﬁnisher of our faith. Hebrews 12:1, 2.</p>
      <p>In the epistle to the Hebrews is pointed out the singlehearted purpose that should characterize the Christian’s
          race for eternal life.... Envy, malice, evil</p>
      <p>thinking, evilspeaking, <nobr>covetousness—these</nobr> are weights that the Christian must lay aside if he
          would run successfully the race for immortality. Every habit or practice that leads into sin and brings
          dishonor upon Christ must be put away, whatever the sacriﬁce.... “Know ye not,” Paul asked, “that they which
          run in a</p>
      <p>race run all, but one receiveth the prize?” However eagerly and earnestly the runners might strive, the prize
          could be awarded to but one....</p>
      <p>Such is not the case in the Christian warfare. Not one who complies with the conditions will be disappointed at
          the end of the race.... The race is not to the</p>
      <p>swift, nor the battle to the strong. The weakest saint, as well as the strongest, may wear the crown of
          immortal glory....</p>
      <p>That he might not run uncertainly or at random in the Christian race, Paul subjected himself to severe
          training. The words, “I keep under my body,” literally mean to beat back by severe discipline the desires,
          impulses, and passions....</p>
      <p>It was this singlehearted purpose to win the race for eternal life that Paul longed to see revealed in the
          lives of the Corinthian believers. He knew that in order to reach Christ’s ideal for them, they had before
          them a life struggle from which there would be no release. He entreated them to strive lawfully, day by day
          seeking for piety and moral excellence. He pleaded with them to lay aside every weight and to press forward to
          the goal of perfection in Christ.</p>
      <p>In view of the issue at stake, nothing is small that will help or hinder. Every act casts its weight into the
          scale that determines life’s victory or defeat. And the reward given to those who win will be in proportion to
          the energy and earnestness with which they have striven.</p>
