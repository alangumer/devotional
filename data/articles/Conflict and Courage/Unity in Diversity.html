    <h1>Unity in Diversity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Mark <nobr>3:13-19</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach. Mark
          3:14.</p>
      <p>In these ﬁrst disciples was presented a marked diversity. They were to be the world’s teachers, and they
          represented widely varied types of character. There were Levi Matthew the publican, called from a life of
          business activity, and subservience to Rome; the zealot Simon, the uncompromising foe of the imperial
          authority; the impulsive, <nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr><nobr>warm-hearted</nobr> Peter, with Andrew his
          brother; Judas the Judean, polished, capable, and <nobr>mean-spirited;</nobr> Philip and Thomas, faithful and
          earnest, yet slow of heart to believe; James the less and Jude, of less prominence among the brethren, but men
          of force, positive both in their faults and in their virtues; Nathanael, a child in sincerity and trust; and
          the ambitious, <nobr>loving-hearted</nobr> sons of Zebedee....</p>
      <p>Of the twelve disciples, four were to act a leading part, each in a distinct line. In preparation for this,
          Christ taught them, foreseeing all. James, destined to <nobr>swift-coming</nobr> death by the sword; John,
          longest of the brethren to follow his Master in labor and persecution; Peter, the pioneer in breaking through
          the barriers of ages, and teaching the heathen world; and Judas, in service capable of
          <nobr>pre-eminence</nobr> above his brethren, yet brooding in his soul purposes of whose ripening he little
          dreamed.</p>
      <p>In order successfully to carry forward the work to which they had been called, these disciples, differing so
          widely in natural characteristics, in training, and in habits of life, needed to come into unity of feeling,
          thought, and action. This unity it was Christ’s object to secure.... The burden of His labor for them is
          expressed</p>
      <p>in His prayer to the Father, “that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they
          also may be one in us” (John 17:21).</p>
      <p>In the apostles of our Lord there was nothing to bring glory to themselves. It was evident that the success of
          their labors was due only to God. The lives of these men, the characters they developed, and the mighty work
          that God wrought through them, are a testimony to what He will do for all who are teachable and obedient.</p>
