    <h1>Idolatry Then and Now</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings 17</strong></p>
      <p>Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Exodus 20:3.</p>
      <p>Though in a different form, idolatry exists in the Christian world today as verily as it existed among ancient
          Israel in the days of Elijah. The God of many professedly wise men, of philosophers, poets, politicians,
          <nobr>journalists—the</nobr> God of polished fashionable circles, of many colleges and universities, even of
          some theological <nobr>institutions—is</nobr> little better than Baal, the <nobr>sun-god</nobr> of
          Phoenicia.</p>
      <p>No error accepted by the Christian world strikes more boldly against the authority of Heaven, ... none is more
          pernicious in its results, than the modern doctrine, so rapidly gaining ground, that God’s law is no longer
          binding upon men.</p>
      <p>The Bible is within the reach of all, but there are few who really accept it as the guide of life. Inﬁdelity
          prevails to an alarming extent, not in the world merely, but in the church. Many have come to deny doctrines
          which are the very pillars of the Christian faith. The great facts of creation as presented by the inspired
          writers, the fall of man, the atonement, and the perpetuity of the law of God, are practically rejected,
          either wholly or in part, by a large share of the professedly Christian world. Thousands who pride themselves
          upon their wisdom and independence regard it as an evidence of weakness to place implicit conﬁdence in the
          Bible; they think it a proof of superior talent and learning to cavil at the Scriptures and to spiritualize
          and explain away their most important truths. Many ministers are teaching their people, and many professors
          and teachers are instructing their students, that the law of God has been changed or abrogated; and those who
          regard its requirements as still valid, to be literally obeyed, are thought to be deserving only of ridicule
          or contempt.</p>
      <p>The last great conﬂict between truth and error is but the ﬁnal struggle of the <nobr>long-standing</nobr>
          controversy concerning the law of God. Upon this battle we are now entering.</p>
