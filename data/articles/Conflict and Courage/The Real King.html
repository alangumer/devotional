    <h1>The Real King</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>14:24-46</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. 1 Samuel
          14:24.</p>
      <p>The command to refrain from food was prompted by selﬁsh ambition, and it showed the king to be indifferent to
          the needs of his people when these conﬂicted with his desire for <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> To conﬁrm his
          prohibition by a solemn oath showed Saul to be both rash and profane. The very words of the curse give
          evidence that Saul’s zeal was for himself, and not for the honor of God. He declared his object to be, not
          “that the Lord may be avenged on His enemies,” but “that I may be avenged on mine enemies.” ...</p>
      <p>During the day’s battle Jonathan, who had not heard of the king’s command, unwittingly offended by eating a
          little honey as he passed through a wood. Saul learned of this at evening. He had declared that the violation
          of his edict should be punished with death; and though Jonathan had not been guilty of a willful sin, though
          God had miraculously preserved his life and had wrought deliverance through him, the king declared that the
          sentence must be executed. To spare the life of his son would have been an acknowledgment on the part of Saul
          that he had sinned in making so rash a vow. This would have been humiliating to his pride. “God do so, and
          more also,” was his terrible sentence: “thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.” ...</p>
      <p>At Gilgal, but a short time before, Saul had presumed to ofﬁciate as priest, contrary to the command of God.
          When reproved by Samuel, he had stubbornly justiﬁed himself. Now, when his own command was
          <nobr>disobeyed—though</nobr> the command was unreasonable and had been violated through
          <nobr>ignorance—the</nobr> king and father sentenced his son to death.</p>
      <p>The people refused to allow the sentence to be executed. Braving the anger of the king, they declared, “Shall
          Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not
          one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.” The proud monarch dared not
          disregard this unanimous verdict, and the life of Jonathan was preserved.</p>
