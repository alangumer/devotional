    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis 12:9, 10</strong></p>
      <p>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with
          ﬁre, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:7.</p>
      <p>Abraham continued to journey southward, and again his faith was tested. The heavens withheld their rain, the
          brooks ceased to ﬂow in the valleys, and the grass withered on the plains. The ﬂocks and herds found no
          pasture, and starvation threatened the whole encampment. Did not the patriarch now question the leadings of
          Providence? Did he not look back with longing to the plenty of the Chaldean plains? All were eagerly watching
          to see what Abraham would do, as trouble after trouble came upon him. So long as his conﬁdence appeared
          unshaken, they felt that there was hope....</p>
      <p>Abraham could not explain the leadings of Providence; he had not realized his expectations; but he held fast
          the promise, “I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.” With earnest prayer
          he considered how to preserve the life of his people and his ﬂocks, but he would not allow circumstances to
          shake his faith in God’s word. To escape the famine he went down into Egypt. He did not forsake Canaan, or in
          his extremity turn back to the Chaldean land from which he came, where there was no scarcity of bread; but he
          sought a temporary refuge as near as possible to the Land of Promise, intending shortly to return where God
          had placed him.</p>
      <p>The Lord in His providence had brought this trial upon Abraham to teach him lessons of submission, patience,
          and faith....</p>
      <p>God permits trials to assail His people, that by their constancy and obedience they themselves may be
          spiritually enriched, and that their example may be a source of strength to others. “I know the thoughts that
          I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil” (Jeremiah 29:11). The very trials that
          task our faith most severely and make it seem that God has forsaken us, are to lead us closer to Christ, that
          we may lay all our burdens at His feet and experience the peace which He will give us in exchange.</p>
