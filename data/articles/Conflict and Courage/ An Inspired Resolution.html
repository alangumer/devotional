    <h1>An Inspired Resolution</h1>

      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>37:12-36</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall. Genesis
          49:22.</p>
      <p>Joseph regarded his being sold into Egypt as the greatest calamity that could have befallen him; but he saw the
          necessity of trusting in God as he had never done when protected by his father’s love.</p>
      <p>As the caravan journeyed southward toward the borders of Canaan, the boy could discern in the distance the
          hills among which lay his father’s tents. Bitterly he wept at thought of that loving father in his loneliness
          and afﬂiction. Again the scene at Dothan came up before him. He saw his angry brothers and felt their ﬁerce
          glances bent upon him. The stinging, insulting words that had met his agonized entreaties were ringing in his
          ears. With a trembling heart he looked forward to the future. What a change in <nobr>situation—from</nobr> the
          tenderly cherished son to the despised and helpless slave! ...</p>
      <p>But, in the providence of God, even this experience was to be a blessing to him. He had learned in a few hours
          that which years might not otherwise have taught him. His father, strong and tender as his love had been, had
          done him wrong by his partiality and indulgence. This unwise preference had angered his brothers and provoked
          them to the cruel deed that had separated him from his home. Its effects were manifest also in his own
          character. Faults had been encouraged that were now to be corrected....</p>
      <p>His thoughts turned to his father’s God. In his childhood he had been taught to love and fear Him. Often in his
          father’s tent he had listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he ﬂed from his home an exile and a
          fugitive....</p>
      <p>His soul thrilled with the high resolve to prove himself true to <nobr>God—under</nobr> all circumstances to
          act as became a subject of the King of heaven. He would serve the Lord with undivided heart; he would meet the
          trials of his lot with fortitude and perform every duty with ﬁdelity. One day’s experience had been the
          turning point in Joseph’s life. Its terrible calamity had transformed him from a petted child to a man,
          thoughtful, courageous, and <nobr>self-possessed.</nobr></p>
