    <h1>Betrayed into Error</h1>

      <p><strong>Judges <nobr>8:22-27</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Gideon made an ephod ... which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. Judges 8:27.</p>
      <p>The people of Israel, in their gratitude at deliverance from the Midianites, proposed to Gideon that he should
          become their king, and that the throne should be conﬁrmed to his descendants. This proposition was in direct
          violation of the principles of the theocracy.... Gideon recognized this fact; his answer shows how</p>
      <p>true and noble were his motives. “I will not rule over you,” he declared; “neither shall my son rule over you:
          the Lord shall rule over you.”</p>
      <p>But Gideon was betrayed into another error, which brought disaster upon his house and upon all Israel. The
          season of inactivity that succeeds a great struggle is often fraught with greater danger than is the period of
          conﬂict. To this danger Gideon was now exposed. A spirit of unrest was upon him. Hitherto he had been content
          to fulﬁll the directions given him from God; but now, instead of waiting for divine guidance, he began to plan
          for himself. When the armies of the Lord have gained a signal victory, Satan will redouble his efforts to
          overthrow the work of God....</p>
      <p>Because he had been commanded to offer sacriﬁce upon the rock where the Angel appeared to him, Gideon concluded
          that he had been appointed to ofﬁciate as a priest. Without waiting for the divine sanction, he determined to
          provide a suitable place, and to institute a system of worship similar to that carried on at the tabernacle.
          With the strong popular feeling in his favor he found no difﬁculty in carrying out his plan.</p>
      <p>Those who are placed in the highest positions may lead astray, especially if they feel that there is no danger.
          The wisest err; the strongest grow weary.... It</p>
      <p>is a solemn thought that the removal of one safeguard from the conscience, the failure to fulﬁll one good
          resolution, the formation of one wrong habit, may result not only in our own ruin, but in the ruin of those
          who have put conﬁdence in us. Our only safety is to follow where the steps of the Master lead the way, to
          trust for protection implicitly to Him who says, “Follow me.”</p>
