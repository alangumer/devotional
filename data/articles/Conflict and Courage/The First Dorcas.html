    <h1>The First Dorcas</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>9:36-42</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman
          was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. Acts 9:36.</p>
      <p>At Joppa, which was near Lydda, there lived a woman named Dorcas, whose good deeds had made her greatly
          beloved. She was a worthy disciple of Jesus, and her life was ﬁlled with acts of kindness. She knew who needed
          comfortable clothing and who needed sympathy, and she freely ministered to the poor and the sorrowful....</p>
      <p>“And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died.” ... Hearing that Peter was at Lydda, the
          believers sent messengers to him.... “When he was</p>
      <p>come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats
          and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.” ...</p>
      <p>The apostle’s heart was touched with sympathy as he beheld their sorrow. Then, directing that the weeping
          friends be sent from the room, he kneeled down and prayed fervently to God to restore Dorcas to life and
          health.... Dorcas had</p>
      <p>been of great service to the church, and God saw ﬁt to bring her back from the land of the enemy, that her
          skill and energy might still be a blessing to others, and also that by this manifestation of His power the
          cause of Christ might be strengthened.</p>
      <p>Let the children and youth learn from the Bible how God has honored the work of the everyday toiler.... Let
          them read of Jesus the carpenter, and Paul the</p>
      <p><nobr>tent-maker,</nobr> who with the toil of the craftsman linked the highest ministry, human and divine. Let
          them read of the lad whose ﬁve loaves were used by the Saviour in that wonderful miracle for the feeding of
          the multitude; of Dorcas the seamstress, called back from death, that she might continue to make garments for
          the poor; of the wise woman described in the Proverbs, who “seeketh wool and ﬂax, and worketh willingly with
          her hands.” ... who “stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, ... reacheth forth her hands to the needy.”
          ...</p>
      <p>Of such a one, God says: “She shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
          praise her in the gates.”</p>
