      <p><strong>John <nobr>14:1-11;</nobr> John <nobr>6:5-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath
          seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? John 14:9.</p>
      <p>At the head of one of the groups into which the apostles are divided stands the name of Philip. He was the ﬁrst
          disciple to whom Jesus addressed the distinct command, “Follow me.” ... He had listened to the teaching of
          John the Baptist, and had heard his announcement of Christ as the Lamb of God. Philip was a sincere seeker for
          truth, but he was slow of heart to believe.... Though Christ</p>
      <p>had been proclaimed by the voice from heaven as the Son of God, to Philip He was “Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
          Joseph” (John 1:45). Again, when the ﬁve thousand were fed, Philip’s lack of faith was shown. It was to test
          him that Jesus questioned, “Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?” ... Again, in those last hours
          before the cruciﬁxion, the words of Philip were such as to discourage faith.... So slow of heart, so weak in
          faith, was that disciple who for three years</p>
      <p>had been with Jesus.</p>
      <p>He wished Christ to reveal the Father in bodily form; but in Christ God had already revealed Himself. Is it
          possible, Christ said, that after walking with Me, hearing My words, seeing the miracle of feeding the ﬁve
          thousand, of healing the sick of the dread disease leprosy, of bringing the dead to life, of raising Lazarus,
          who was a prey to death, whose body had indeed seen corruption, you do not know Me? Is it possible that you do
          not discern the Father in the works that He does by Me? ... God cannot be seen in external form by any human
          being. Christ alone can represent the Father to humanity.</p>
      <p>In happy contrast to Philip’s unbelief was the childlike trust of Nathanael. He was a man of intensely earnest
          nature, one whose faith took hold upon unseen realities. Yet Philip was a student in the school of Christ, and
          the divine Teacher bore patiently with his unbelief and dullness. When the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the
          disciples, Philip became a teacher after the divine order. He knew whereof he spoke, and he taught with an
          assurance that carried conviction to the hearers.</p>
