      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>4:1-5</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
          And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. Genesis 4:4, 5.</p>
      <p>Cain came before God with murmuring and inﬁdelity in his heart in regard to the promised sacriﬁce and the
          necessity of the sacriﬁcial offerings. His gift expressed no penitence for sin. He felt, as many now feel,
          that it would be an acknowledgement of weakness to follow the exact plan marked out by God, of trusting his
          salvation wholly to the atonement of the promised Saviour. He chose the course of
          <nobr>self-dependence.</nobr> He would come in his own merits. He would not bring the lamb, and mingle its
          blood with his offering, but would present his fruits, the products of his labor. He presented his offering as
          a favor done to God, through which he expected to secure the divine approval. Cain obeyed in building an
          altar, obeyed in bringing a sacriﬁce, but he rendered only a partial obedience. The essential part, the
          recognition of the need of a Redeemer, was left out....</p>
      <p>Cain and Abel represent two classes that will exist in the world till the close of time. One class avail
          themselves of the appointed sacriﬁce for sin; the other venture to depend upon their own merits; theirs is a
          sacriﬁce without the virtue of divine mediation, and thus it is not able to bring man into favor with God. It
          is only through the merits of Jesus that our transgressions can be pardoned....</p>
      <p>It is claimed by some that the human race is in need, not of redemption, but of <nobr>development—that</nobr>
          it can reﬁne, elevate, and regenerate itself. As Cain thought to secure the divine favor by an offering that
          lacked the blood of a sacriﬁce, so do these expect to exalt humanity to the divine standard, independent of
          the atonement. This history of Cain shows what must be the result. It shows what man will become apart from
          Christ. Humanity has no power to regenerate itself. It does not tend upward, toward the divine, but downward,
          toward the satanic. Christ is our only hope. “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby
          we must be saved.” “Neither is there salvation in any other” (Acts 4:12).</p>
