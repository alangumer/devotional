    <h1>God Protects His Own</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>12:10-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; saying, Touch not mine anointed,
          and do my prophets no harm. Psalm 105:14, 15.</p>
      <p>It is by close, testing trials that God disciplines His servants. He sees that some have powers which may be
          used in the advancement of His work, and He puts these persons upon trial; in His providence He brings them
          into positions that test their character and reveal defects and weaknesses that have been hidden from their
          own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to correct these defects and to ﬁt themselves for His service. He
          shows them their own weakness, and teaches them to lean upon Him; for He is their only help and safeguard.
          Thus His object is attained. They are educated, trained, and disciplined, prepared to fulﬁll the grand purpose
          for which their powers were given them....</p>
      <p>During his stay in Egypt, Abraham gave evidence that he was not free from human weakness and imperfection. In
          concealing the fact that Sarah was his wife, he betrayed a distrust of the divine care, a lack of that lofty
          faith and courage so often and nobly exempliﬁed in his life.... He reasoned that he was not guilty</p>
      <p>of falsehood in representing Sarah as his sister, for she was the daughter of his father, though not of his
          mother. But this concealment of the real relation between them was deception. No deviation from strict
          integrity can meet God’s approval. Through Abraham’s lack of faith, Sarah was placed in great peril. The king
          of Egypt, being informed of her beauty, caused her to be taken to his palace, intending to make her his wife.
          But the Lord, in His great mercy, protected Sarah by sending judgments upon the royal household....</p>
      <p>The warning that had been given to Pharaoh proved a protection to Abraham in his <nobr>after-intercourse</nobr>
          with heathen peoples; ... it was seen that the God whom Abraham worshiped would protect His servant, and that
          any injury done him would be avenged. It is a dangerous thing to wrong one of the children of the King of
          heaven.</p>
