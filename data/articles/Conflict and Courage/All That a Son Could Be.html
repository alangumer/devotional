    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Timothy 2</strong></p>
      <p>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who has no need to be ashamed, rightly
          handling the word of truth. 2 Timothy 2:15, R.S.V.</p>
      <p>Paul loved Timothy, his “own son in the faith” (1 Timothy 1:2). The great apostle often drew the younger
          disciple out, questioning him in regard to Scripture history, and as they traveled from place to place, he
          carefully taught him how to do successful work.</p>
      <p>The affection between Paul and Timothy began with Timothy’s conversion; and the tie had strengthened as they
          had shared the hopes, the perils, and the toils of missionary life, till they seemed to be as one. The
          disparity in their ages and the difference in their characters made their love for each other more earnest.
          The ardent, zealous, indomitable spirit of Paul found repose and comfort in the mild, yielding, retiring
          disposition of Timothy. The faithful ministration and tender love of this tried companion had brightened many
          a dark hour in the apostle’s life....</p>
      <p>All that a son could be to a loved and honored father, the youthful Timothy was to the tried and lonely
          Paul.</p>
      <p>Paul loved Timothy because Timothy loved God. His intelligent knowledge of experimental piety and of the truth
          gave him distinction and inﬂuence. The piety and inﬂuence of his home life was not of a cheap order, but pure,
          sensible, and uncorrupted by false sentiments.... The Word of God was the rule which guided</p>
      <p>Timothy.... Impressions of the highest possible order were kept before his mind.</p>
      <p>His home instructors cooperated with God in educating this young man to bear the burdens that were to come upon
          him at an early age.</p>
      <p>In his work, Timothy constantly sought Paul’s advice and instruction. He did not move from impulse, but
          exercised consideration and calm thought.... The</p>
      <p>Holy Spirit found in him one who could be molded and fashioned as a temple for the indwelling of the divine
          Presence.</p>
      <p>As the lessons of the Bible are wrought into the daily life, they have a deep and lasting inﬂuence upon the
          character. These lessons Timothy learned and practiced.</p>
