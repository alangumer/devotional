      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>1:2-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the
          God of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not
          come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. 2 Kings 1:16.</p>
      <p>During his father’s reign, Ahaziah had witnessed the wondrous works of the Most High. He had seen the terrible
          evidences that God had given apostate Israel of the way in which He regards those who set aside the binding
          claims of His law. Ahaziah had acted as if these awful realities were but idle tales. Instead of humbling his
          heart before the Lord, he had followed after Baal, and at last he had ventured upon this, his most daring act
          of impiety....</p>
      <p>Today the mysteries of heathen worship are replaced by the secret associations and seances, the obscurities and
          wonders, of spiritistic mediums. The disclosures of these mediums are eagerly received by thousands who refuse
          to accept light from God’s word or through His Spirit....</p>
      <p>The apostles of nearly all forms of spiritism claim to have power to heal....</p>
      <p>And there are not a few, even in this Christian age, who go to these healers, instead of trusting in the power
          of the living God and the skill of <nobr>well-qualiﬁed</nobr> physicians....</p>
      <p>The king of Israel, turning from God to ask help of the worst enemy of his people, proclaimed to the heathen
          that he had more conﬁdence in their idols than in the God of heaven. In the same manner do men and women
          dishonor Him when they turn from the Source of strength and wisdom to ask help or counsel from the powers of
          darkness....</p>
      <p>Those who give themselves up to the sorcery of Satan, may boast of great beneﬁt received; but does this prove
          their course to be wise or safe? What if life should be prolonged? What if temporal gain should be secured?
          Will it pay in the end to have disregarded the will of God? All such apparent gain will prove at last an
          irrecoverable loss. We cannot with impunity break down a single barrier which God has erected to guard His
          people from Satan’s power.</p>
