    <h1>God Remembers His Own</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great
          wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In all ages God’s appointed witnesses have exposed themselves to reproach and persecution for the truth’s sake.
          Joseph was maligned and persecuted....</p>
      <p>David, the chosen messenger of God, was hunted like a beast of prey by his enemies.... Stephen was stoned
          because he preached Christ and Him cruciﬁed.</p>
      <p>Paul was imprisoned, beaten with rods, stoned, and ﬁnally put to death.... John</p>
      <p>was banished to the Isle of Patmos “for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p>These examples of human steadfastness bear witness to the faithfulness of God’s <nobr>promises—of</nobr> His
          abiding presence and sustaining grace. They testify to the power of faith to withstand the powers of the
          world.</p>
      <p>The season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that can endure weariness, delay, and
          <nobr>hunger—a</nobr> faith that will not faint though severely tried.</p>
      <p>Many of all nations and of all classes, high and low, rich and poor, black and white, will be cast into the
          most unjust and cruel bondage. The beloved of God pass weary days, bound in chains, shut in by prison bars,
          sentenced to be slain, some apparently left to die of starvation in dark and loathsome dungeons.... No</p>
      <p>human hand is ready to lend them help.</p>
      <p>Will the Lord forget His people in this trying hour? Did He forget faithful Noah when judgments were visited
          upon the antediluvian world? Did He forget Lot when the ﬁre came down from heaven to consume the cities of the
          plain? ...</p>
      <p>Did He forget Elijah when the oath of Jezebel threatened him with the fate of the prophets of Baal? Did He
          forget Jeremiah in the dark and dismal pit of his prison house? Did He forget the three worthies in the ﬁery
          furnace? or Daniel in the den of lions? ...</p>
      <p>Though enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon walls cannot cut off the communication between their
          souls and Christ. One who sees their every weakness, who is acquainted with every trial, is above all earthly
          powers; and angels will come to them in lonely cells, bringing light and peace from heaven.</p>
