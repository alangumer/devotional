    <h1>Men’s Decrees Versus God’s</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Esther 3</strong></p>
      <p>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the
          commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Revelation 12:17.</p>
      <p>Through Esther the queen the Lord accomplished a mighty deliverance for His people. At a time when it seemed
          that no power could save them, Esther and the women associated with her, by fasting and prayer and prompt
          action, met the issue, and brought salvation to their people.</p>
      <p>The trying experiences that came to God’s people in the days of Esther were not peculiar to that age alone....
          The same spirit that in ages past led men to</p>
      <p>persecute the true church, will in the future lead to the pursuance of a similar course toward those who
          maintain their loyalty to God.... The decree that will</p>
      <p>ﬁnally go forth against the remnant people of God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the
          Jews. Today the enemies of the true church see in the little company keeping the Sabbath commandment, a
          Mordecai at the gate. The reverence of God’s people for His law is a constant rebuke to those who have cast
          off the fear of the Lord and are trampling on His Sabbath....</p>
      <p>Men of position and reputation will join with the lawless and the vile to take counsel against the people of
          God. Wealth, genius, education, will combine to cover them with contempt. Persecuting rulers, ministers, and
          church members will conspire against them.</p>
      <p>With voice and pen, by boasts, threats, and ridicule, they will seek to overthrow their faith. By false
          representations and angry appeals, men will stir up the passions of the people. Not having a “Thus saith the
          Scriptures” to bring against the advocates of the Bible Sabbath, they will resort to oppressive enactments to
          supply the lack. To secure popularity and patronage, legislators will yield to the demand for Sunday laws. But
          those who fear God, cannot accept an institution that violates a precept of the Decalogue. On this battleﬁeld
          will be fought the last great conﬂict in the controversy between truth and error. And we are not left in doubt
          as to the issue. Today, as in the days of Esther and Mordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and His
          people.</p>
