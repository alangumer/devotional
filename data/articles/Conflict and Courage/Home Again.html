    <h1>Home Again!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order:
          Christ the ﬁrstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. 1 Corinthians 15:22, 23.</strong></p>
      <p>Amid the reeling of the earth, the ﬂash of lightning, and the roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God
          calls forth the sleeping saints.... The dead shall hear</p>
      <p>that voice, and they that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with the tread of the exceeding great
          army of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people....</p>
      <p>All come forth from their graves the same in stature as when they entered the tomb. Adam, who stands among the
          risen throng, is of lofty height and majestic form, in stature but little below the Son of God. He presents a
          marked contrast to the people of later generations; in this one respect is shown the great degeneracy of the
          race. But all arise with the freshness and vigor of eternal youth....</p>
      <p>All blemishes and deformities are left in the grave. Restored to the tree of life in the <nobr>long-lost</nobr>
          Eden, the redeemed will “grow up” to the full stature of the race in its primeval glory....</p>
      <p>As the ransomed ones are welcomed to the City of God, there rings out upon the air an exultant cry of
          adoration. The two Adams are about to meet. The Son of God is standing with outstretched arms to receive the
          father of our <nobr>race—the</nobr> being whom He created, who sinned against his Maker, and for whose sin the
          marks of the cruciﬁxion are borne upon the Saviour’s form. As Adam discerns the prints of the cruel nails, he
          does not fall upon the bosom of his Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying: “Worthy,
          worthy is the Lamb that was slain!” Tenderly the Saviour lifts him up and bids him look once more upon the
          Eden home from which he has so long been exiled....</p>
      <p>This reunion is witnessed by the angels who wept at the fall of Adam and rejoiced when Jesus, after His
          resurrection, ascended to heaven, having opened the grave for all who should believe on His name. Now they
          behold the work of redemption accomplished, and they unite their voices in the song of praise.</p>
