    <h1>Nothing Too Precious</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>22:1-14</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the promises offered up his only
          begotten son, ... accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead. Hebrews
          <nobr>11:17-19.</nobr></p>
      <p>God had called Abraham to be the father of the faithful, and his life was to stand as an example of faith to
          succeeding generations. But his faith had not been perfect. He had shown distrust of God in concealing the
          fact that Sarah was his wife, and again in his marriage with Hagar. That he might reach the highest standard,
          God subjected him to another test, the closest which man was ever called to endure.</p>
      <p>The Lord spoke unto him, saying: “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,” “and offer him ...
          for a burnt offering.” The heart of the old man stood still with horror. The loss of such a son by disease
          would have been most heartrending to the fond father, it would have bowed his whitened head with sorrow; but
          now he is commanded to shed the precious blood of that son with his own hand. It seemed to him a fearful
          impossibility. Yet God had spoken, and His word must be obeyed. Abraham was stricken in years, but this did
          not excuse him from duty. He grasped the staff of faith and in dumb agony took by the hand his child,
          beautiful in the rosy health of youth, and went out to obey the word of God....</p>
      <p>Abraham did not stop to question how God’s promises could be fulﬁlled if Isaac were slain. He did not stay to
          reason with his aching heart, but carried out the divine command to the very letter, till, just as the knife
          was about to be plunged into the quivering ﬂesh of the child, the word came: “Lay not thine hand upon the
          lad;” “for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from
          me.”</p>
      <p>This act of faith in Abraham is recorded for our beneﬁt. It teaches the great lesson of conﬁdence in the
          requirements of God, however close and cutting they may be; and it teaches children perfect submission to
          their parents and to God. By Abraham’s obedience we are taught that nothing is too precious for us to give to
          God.</p>
