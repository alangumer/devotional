    <h1>God’s Hand on the Machinery</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ezra 1; Isaiah <nobr>45:1-6</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt
          be built; and to the temple, thy foundation shall be laid. Isaiah 44:28.</p>
      <p>The Lord has resources. His hand is on the machinery. When the time came for His temple to be rebuilt, He moved
          upon Cyrus as His agent to discern the prophecies concerning Himself, and to grant the Jewish people their
          liberty.</p>
      <p>The deliverance of Daniel from the den of lions had been used of God to create a favorable impression upon the
          mind of Cyrus the Great....</p>
      <p>As the king saw the words foretelling, more than a hundred years before his birth, the manner in which Babylon
          should be taken; as he read the message addressed to him by the Ruler of the universe, ... his heart was
          profoundly moved, and he determined to fulﬁll his divinely appointed mission. He would let the Judean captives
          go free; he would help them restore the temple of Jehovah. In a written proclamation published “throughout all
          his kingdom,” Cyrus made known his desire to provide for the return of the Hebrews and for the rebuilding of
          their temple....</p>
      <p>Tidings of this decree reached the farthermost provinces of the king’s realm, and everywhere among the children
          of the dispersion there was great rejoicing. Many, like Daniel, had been studying the prophecies, and had been
          asking God for His promised intervention in behalf of Zion....</p>
      <p>Upon Zerubbabel ... Cyrus placed the responsibility of acting as governor of the company returning to Judea;
          and with him was associated Joshua the high priest. The long journey across the desert wastes was accomplished
          in safety, and the happy company ... at once undertook the work of <nobr>re-establishing</nobr> that which had
          been broken down and destroyed.</p>
      <p>The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. All kings, all nations, are His, under His rule and government. His resources
          are inﬁnite. The wise man declares, “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he
          turneth it whithersoever he will.” Those upon whose actions hang the destinies of nations, are watched over
          with a vigilance that knows no relaxation by Him who “giveth salvation unto kings.”</p>
