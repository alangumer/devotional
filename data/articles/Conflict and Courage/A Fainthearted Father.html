    <h1>A Fainthearted Father</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>2:22-36</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacriﬁce nor offering for ever. 1 Samuel 3:14.</p>
      <p>Eli did not manage his household according to God’s rules for family government. He followed his own
          judgment.... Many are now making a similar</p>
      <p>mistake. They think they know a better way of training their children than that which God has given in His
          word. They foster wrong tendencies in them, urging as an excuse. “They are too young to be punished. Wait till
          they become older, and can be reasoned with.” Thus wrong habits are left to strengthen until they become
          second nature. The children grow up without restraint, with traits of character that are a lifelong curse to
          them and are liable to be reproduced in others.</p>
      <p>In contrast with the story of Abraham’s faithfulness, and the words of commendation spoken of him, is the
          record of Eli, who kept his sons in ofﬁce while they were committing great iniquity. Here is a lesson for all
          parents.... Evil,</p>
      <p>without restraint, was tolerated by Eli. The result was sin that would not be atoned for, by sacriﬁce or by
          offerings, forevermore.</p>
      <p>While some err upon the side of undue severity, Eli went to the opposite extreme.... Their faults were
          overlooked in their childhood, and excused in their</p>
      <p>days of youth. The commands of the parents were disregarded, and the father did not enforce obedience.</p>
      <p>The children saw that they could hold the lines of control, and they improved the opportunity. As the sons
          advanced in years, they lost all respect for their fainthearted father. They went on in sin without restraint.
          He remonstrated with them, but his words fell unheeded. Gross sins and revolting crimes were daily committed
          by them, until the Lord Himself visited with judgment the transgressors of His law....</p>
      <p>The Lord Himself decreed that for the sins of Eli’s sons no atonement should be made by sacriﬁce or offering
          forever. How great, how lamentable, was their <nobr>fall,—men</nobr> upon whom rested sacred responsibilities,
          proscribed, outlawed from mercy, by a just and holy God!</p>
