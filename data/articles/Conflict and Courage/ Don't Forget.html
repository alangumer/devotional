    <h1>Don’t Forget</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis 19:19, 29</strong></p>
      <p>Remember Lot’s wife. Luke 17:32.</p>
      <p>One of the fugitives ventured to cast a look backward to the doomed city, and she became a monument of God’s
          judgment. If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angels’ warning, but had earnestly ﬂed toward
          the mountains, without one word of pleading or remonstrance, his wife also would have made her escape. The
          inﬂuence of his example would have saved her from the sin that sealed her doom. But his hesitancy and delay
          caused her to lightly regard the divine warning. While her body was upon the plain, her heart clung to Sodom,
          and she perished with it. She rebelled against God because His judgments involved her possessions and her
          children in the ruin. Although so greatly favored in being called out from the wicked city, she felt that she
          was severely dealt with, because the wealth that it had taken years to accumulate must be left to destruction.
          Instead of thankfully accepting deliverance, she presumptuously looked back to desire the life of those who
          had rejected the divine warning. Her sin showed her to be unworthy of life, for the preservation of which she
          felt so little gratitude.</p>
      <p>We should beware of treating lightly God’s gracious provisions for our salvation. There are Christians who say,
          “I do not care to be saved unless my companion and children are saved with me.” They feel that heaven would
          not be heaven to them without the presence of those who are so dear. But have those who cherish this feeling a
          right conception of their own relation to God, in view of His great goodness and mercy toward them? Have they
          forgotten that they are bound by the strongest ties of love and honor and loyalty to the service of their
          Creator and Redeemer? The invitations of mercy are addressed to all; and because our friends reject the
          Saviour’s pleading love, shall we also turn away?</p>
      <p>The redemption of the soul is precious. Christ has paid an inﬁnite price for our salvation, and no one who
          appreciates the value of this great sacriﬁce or the worth of the soul will despise God’s offered mercy because
          others choose to do so.</p>
