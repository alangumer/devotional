    <h1>A Living Sacriﬁce</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>1:13-15;</nobr> Luke <nobr>3:1-9</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>With eyes wide open to the mercies of God, I beg you, my brothers, as an act of intelligent worship, to give
          him your bodies, as a living sacriﬁce, consecrated to him and acceptable by him. Romans 12:1, Phillips.</p>
      <p>The Lord has been calling the attention of His people to health reform. This is one of the great branches of
          the work of preparation for the coming of the Son of man. John the Baptist went forth in the spirit and power
          of Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord....</p>
      <p>John separated himself from friends and from the luxuries of life. The simplicity of his dress, a garment woven
          of camel’s hair, was a standing rebuke to the extravagance and display of the Jewish priests, and of the
          people generally. His diet, purely vegetable, of locusts and wild honey, was a rebuke to the indulgence of
          appetite and the gluttony that everywhere prevailed.... Those who are to prepare</p>
      <p>the way for the second coming of Christ are represented by faithful Elijah, as John came in the spirit of
          Elijah to prepare the way for Christ’s ﬁrst advent. The great subject of reform is to be agitated....
          Temperance in all things is to be connected</p>
      <p>with the message, to turn the people of God from their idolatry, their gluttony, and their extravagance in
          dress and other things.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> humility, and temperance required of the righteous, whom God especially leads and
          blesses, is to be presented to the people in contrast to the extravagant, <nobr>health-destroying</nobr>
          habits of those who live in this degenerate age....</p>
      <p>There is nowhere to be found so great a cause of physical and moral degeneracy as a neglect of this important
          subject. Those who indulge appetite and passion, and close their eyes to the light for fear they will see
          sinful indulgences which they are unwilling to forsake, are guilty before God. Whoever turns from the light in
          one instance hardens his heart to disregard the light upon other matters. Whoever violates moral obligations
          in the matter of eating and dressing prepares the way to violate the claims of God in regard to eternal
          interests. Our bodies are not our own. God has claims upon us to take care of the habitation He has given us,
          that we may present our bodies to Him a living sacriﬁce, holy and acceptable.</p>
