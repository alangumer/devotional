    <h1>A Foolish Wise Man</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Samuel <nobr>16:15-17:24</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil
          upon Absalom. 2 Samuel 17:14.</p>
      <p>Ahithophel urged upon Absalom the necessity of immediate action against David.... This plan was approved by the
          king’s counselors. Had it been followed,</p>
      <p>David would surely have been slain, unless the Lord had directly interposed to save him. But a wisdom higher
          than that of the renowned Ahithophel was directing events....</p>
      <p>Hushai had not been called to the council, and he would not intrude himself unasked, lest suspicion should be
          drawn upon him as a spy; but after the assembly had dispersed, Absalom, who had a high regard for the judgment
          of his father’s counselor, submitted to him the plan of Ahithophel. Hushai saw that if the proposed plan were
          followed, David would be lost. And he said, “The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.”
          ... He suggested a plan attractive to a vain and selﬁsh nature, fond of the show of power.... “And Absalom and
          all the</p>
      <p>men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” But there was
          one who was not <nobr>deceived—one</nobr> who clearly foresaw the result of this fatal mistake of
          Absalom’s.</p>
      <p>Ahithophel knew that the cause of the rebels was lost. And he knew that whatever might be the fate of the
          prince, there was no hope for the counselor who had instigated his greatest crimes. Ahithophel had encouraged
          Absalom in rebellion; he had counseled him to the most abominable wickedness, to the dishonor of his father;
          he had advised the slaying of David and had planned its accomplishment; he had cut off the last possibility of
          his own reconciliation with the king; and now another was preferred before him, even by Absalom.</p>
      <p>Jealous, angry, and desperate, Ahithophel “gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in
          order, and hanged himself, and died.” Such was the result of the wisdom of one, who, with all his high
          endowments, did not make God his counselor.</p>
