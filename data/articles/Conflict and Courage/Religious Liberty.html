      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>4:1-22</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you
          more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. Acts 4:19,
          20.</p>
      <p>On the day following the healing of the cripple [Acts 3], Annas and Caiaphas, with the other dignitaries of the
          temple, met together for the trial, and the prisoners [Peter and John] were brought before them. In that very
          room and before some of those very men, Peter had shamefully denied his Lord. This came distinctly to his mind
          as he appeared for his own trial. He now had an opportunity of redeeming his cowardice....</p>
      <p>But the Peter who denied Christ in the hour of His greatest need was impulsive and <nobr>self-conﬁdent,</nobr>
          differing widely from the Peter who was brought before the Sanhedrin for examination. Since his fall he had
          been converted. He was no longer proud and boastful, but modest and <nobr>self-distrustful.</nobr> He was
          ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit, and by the help of this power he was resolved to remove the stain of his apostasy
          by honoring the name he had once disowned.</p>
      <p>The principle for which the disciples stood so fearlessly when, in answer to the command not to speak any more
          in the name of Jesus, they declared, “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than
          unto God, judge ye,” is the same that the adherents of the gospel struggled to maintain in the days of the
          Reformation....</p>
      <p>This principle we in our day are ﬁrmly to maintain. The banner of truth and religious liberty held aloft by the
          founders of the gospel church and by God’s witnesses during the centuries that have passed since then, has, in
          this last conﬂict, been committed to our hands.... We are to recognize human government as an</p>
      <p>ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But
          when its claims conﬂict with the claims of God, we must obey God rather than men. God’s word must be
          recognized as above all human legislation. A “Thus saith the Lord” is not to be set aside for a “Thus saith
          the church” or a “Thus saith the state.” The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly
          potentates.</p>
