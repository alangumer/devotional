    <h1>That We may be Encouraged</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For all those words which were written long ago are meant to teach us today; that when we read in the
          scriptures of the endurance of men and of all the help that God gave them in those days, we may be encouraged
          to go on hoping in our own time. Romans 15:4, Phillips.</strong></p>
      <p>The lives recorded in the Bible are authentic histories of actual individuals. From Adam down through
          successive generations to the times of the apostles we have a plain, unvarnished account of what actually
          occurred and the genuine experience of real characters. It is a subject of wonder to many that inspired
          history should narrate in the lives of good men facts that tarnish their moral characters.... The inspired
          writers did not testify to falsehoods to prevent the pages</p>
      <p>of sacred history being clouded by the record of human frailties and faults....</p>
      <p>It is one of the best evidences of the authenticity of the Scriptures that the truth is not glossed over nor
          the sins of its chief characters suppressed.... How many</p>
      <p>biographies have been written of faultless Christians, who, in their ordinary home life and church relations,
          shone as examples of immaculate piety.... Yet had the</p>
      <p>pen of inspiration written their histories, how different would they have appeared. There would have been
          revealed human weaknesses, struggles with selﬁshness, bigotry, and pride, hidden sins, perhaps, and the
          continual warfare between the spirit and the ﬂesh....</p>
      <p>Had our good Bible been written by uninspired persons, it would have presented quite a different appearance and
          would have been a discouraging study to erring mortals, who are contending with natural frailties and the
          temptations of a wily foe. But as it is, we have a correct record of the religious experience of marked
          characters in Bible history. Men whom God favored, and to whom He entrusted great responsibilities, were
          sometimes overcome by temptation and committed sins, even as we of the present day strive, waver, and
          frequently fall into error. But it is encouraging to desponding hearts to know that through God’s grace they
          could gain fresh vigor to again rise above their evil natures; and, remembering this, we are ready to renew
          the conﬂict ourselves.</p>
