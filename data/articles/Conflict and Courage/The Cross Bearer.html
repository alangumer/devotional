    <h1>The Cross Bearer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>27:26-33</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they
          laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. Luke 23:26.</p>
      <p>Jesus had hardly passed the gate of Pilate’s house when the cross which had been prepared for Barabbas was
          brought out and laid upon His bruised and bleeding shoulders. He had borne His burden but a few rods, when,
          from loss of blood and excessive weariness and pain, He fell fainting to the ground. When He revived, the
          cross was again placed upon His shoulders, and He was forced forward. He staggered on for a few steps, bearing
          His heavy load, and then fell as one lifeless to the ground. The priests and rulers felt no compassion for
          their suffering victim, but they saw that it was impossible for Him to carry the instrument of torture
          farther. They were puzzled to ﬁnd anyone who would humiliate himself to bear the cross to the place of
          execution.</p>
      <p>The crowd that followed the Saviour to Calvary taunted and reviled Him because He could not carry the wooden
          cross. They all saw the weak and staggering steps of Christ, but compassion did not reveal itself in the
          hearts of those who had advanced from one step to another in their abuse and torture of the Son of
          God....</p>
      <p>A stranger, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming to the city from the country, hears the crowd pass the taunts and
          ribaldry; he hears the contemptuous repetition, “Make way for the King of the Jews.” He stops in astonishment
          at the scene, and as he expresses his compassion in words and deeds, they seize him and compel him to lift the
          cross which is too heavy for Christ to bear.... That wooden cross borne</p>
      <p>by him to Calvary was the means of Simon taking upon himself the cross of Christ from choice, to ever
          cheerfully stand beneath its burden. His compulsory companionship with Christ in bearing His cross to Calvary,
          in beholding the sad and dreadful work and the spectators beneath the cross, was the means of drawing his
          heart to Jesus. Every word from the lips of Christ was graven upon his soul....</p>
      <p>And the heart of Simon believed.</p>
