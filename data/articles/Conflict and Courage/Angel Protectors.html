      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>12:1-19</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and
          hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod. Acts 12:11.</p>
      <p>The day of Peter’s execution was at last appointed, but still the prayers of the believers ascended to heaven;
          and while all their energies and sympathies were called out in fervent appeals for help, angels of God were
          watching over the imprisoned apostle....</p>
      <p>Herod on this occasion had taken double precautions. To prevent all possibility of release, Peter had been put
          under the charge of sixteen soldiers, who, in different watches, guarded him day and night. In his cell, he
          was placed between two soldiers, and was bound by two chains, each chain being fastened to the wrist of one of
          the soldiers. He was unable to move without their knowledge. With the prison doors securely fastened, and a
          strong guard before them, all chance of rescue or escape through human means was cut off. But man’s extremity
          is God’s opportunity .... Herod was lifting his hand against Omnipotence, and he</p>
      <p>was to be utterly defeated. By the putting forth of His might, God was about to save the precious life that the
          Jews were plotting to destroy.... A mighty angel is</p>
      <p>sent from heaven to rescue Peter.</p>
      <p>The principalities and powers of heaven are watching the warfare which, under apparently discouraging
          circumstances, God’s servants are carrying on. New conquests are being achieved, new honors won, as the
          Christians, rallying round the banner of their Redeemer, go forth to ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. All the
          heavenly angels are at the service of the humble, believing people of God; and as the Lord’s army of workers
          here below sing their songs of praise, the choir above join with them in ascribing praise to God and to His
          Son....</p>
      <p>Every true child of God has the <nobr>co-operation</nobr> of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and
          power attend the meek and lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim and seraphim, and
          angels that excel in strength, stand at God’s right hand, “all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
          them who shall be heirs of salvation.</p>
