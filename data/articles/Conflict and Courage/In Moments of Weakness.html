    <h1>In Moments of Weakness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>19:8-18</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken
          thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left;
          and they seek my life, to take it away. 1 Kings 19:14.</p>
      <p>If, under trying circumstances, men of spiritual power, pressed beyond measure, become discouraged and
          desponding, if at times they see nothing desirable in life, that they should choose it, this is nothing
          strange or new. Let all such remember that one of the mightiest of the prophets ﬂed for his life before the
          rage of an infuriated woman.... Those who, while spending their life energies</p>
      <p>in <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> labor, are tempted to give way to despondency and distrust, may gather courage
          from the experience of Elijah....</p>
      <p>It is the time of greatest weakness that Satan assails the soul with the ﬁercest temptations.... He who had
          maintained his trust in Jehovah during the years of</p>
      <p>drought and famine, he who had stood undaunted before Ahab, he who throughout that trying day on Carmel had
          stood before the whole nation of Israel the sole witness to the true God, in a moment of weariness allowed the
          fear of death to overcome his faith in God....</p>
      <p>When we are encompassed with doubt, perplexed by circumstances, or afﬂicted by poverty or distress, Satan seeks
          to shake our conﬁdence in Jehovah....</p>
      <p>But God understands, and He still pities and loves. He reads the motives and the purposes of the heart. To wait
          patiently, to trust when everything looks dark, is the lesson that the leaders in God’s work need to learn.
          Heaven will not fail them in their day of adversity. Nothing is apparently more helpless, yet really more
          invincible, than the soul that feels its nothingness and relies wholly on God.</p>
      <p>Not alone for men in positions of large responsibility is the lesson of Elijah’s experience in learning anew
          how to trust God in the hour of trial. He who was Elijah’s strength is strong to uphold every struggling child
          of His, no matter how weak. Of everyone He expects loyalty, and to everyone He grants power according to the
          need.</p>
