      <p><strong>1 Samuel 15</strong></p>
      <p>Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not. 1 Samuel 15:3.</p>
      <p>The Lord sent His servant with another message to Saul. By obedience he might still prove his ﬁdelity to God
          and his worthiness to walk before Israel. Samuel came to the king and delivered the word of the Lord....</p>
      <p>The Amalekites had been the ﬁrst to make war upon Israel in the wilderness; and for this sin, together with
          their deﬁance of God and their debasing idolatry, the Lord, through Moses, had pronounced sentence upon
          them.... For four hundred</p>
      <p>years the execution of this sentence had been deferred; but the Amalekites had not turned from their sins. The
          Lord knew that this wicked people would, if it were possible, blot out His people and His worship from the
          earth. Now the time had come for the sentence, so long delayed, to be executed.</p>
      <p>The forbearance that God has exercised toward the wicked, emboldens men in transgression; but their punishment
          will be none the less certain and terrible for being long delayed.... While He does not delight in vengeance,
          He will execute</p>
      <p>judgment upon the transgressors of His law. He is forced to do this, to preserve the inhabitants of the earth
          from utter depravity and ruin. In order to save some He must cut off those who become hardened in sin.... And
          the very fact of His</p>
      <p>reluctance to execute justice testiﬁes to the enormity of the sins that call forth His judgments and to the
          severity of the retribution awaiting the transgressor.</p>
      <p>But while inﬂicting judgment, God remembered mercy. The Amalekites were to be destroyed, but the Kenites, who
          dwelt among them, were spared. This people, though not wholly free from idolatry, were worshipers of God and
          were friendly to Israel. Of this tribe was the <nobr>brother-in-law</nobr> of Moses, Hobab, who had
          accompanied the Israelites in their travels through the wilderness, and by his knowledge of the country had
          rendered them valuable assistance.</p>
