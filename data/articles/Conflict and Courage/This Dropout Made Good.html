      <p>Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for I ﬁnd him a useful assistant. 2 Timothy 4:11, N.E.B.</p>
      <p>Mark’s mother was a convert to the Christian religion, and her home at Jerusalem was an asylum for the
          disciples.... Mark proposed to Paul and Barnabas</p>
      <p>that he should accompany them on their missionary tour. He felt the favor of God in his heart and longed to
          devote himself entirely to the work of the gospel ministry....</p>
      <p>Their way was toilsome; they encountered hardships and privations, and were beset with dangers on every
          side.... But Paul and Barnabas had learned to trust</p>
      <p>God’s power to deliver. Their hearts were ﬁlled with fervent love for perishing souls. As faithful shepherds in
          search of the lost sheep, they gave no thought to their own ease and convenience. Forgetful of self, they
          faltered not when weary, hungry, and cold. They had in view but one <nobr>object—the</nobr> salvation of those
          who had wandered far from the fold....</p>
      <p>Mark, overwhelmed with fear and discouragement, wavered for a time in his purpose to give himself
          wholeheartedly to the Lord’s work. Unused to hardships, he was disheartened by the perils and privations of
          the way.... He had yet to learn</p>
      <p>to face danger and persecution and adversity with a brave heart. As the apostles advanced, and still greater
          difﬁculties were apprehended, Mark was intimidated and, losing all courage, refused to go farther and returned
          to Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other
          hand, was inclined to excuse him because of his inexperience. He felt anxious that Mark should not abandon the
          ministry, for he saw in him qualiﬁcations that would ﬁt him to be a useful worker for Christ. In after years
          his solicitude in Mark’s behalf was richly rewarded, for the young man gave himself unreservedly to the Lord
          and to the work of proclaiming the gospel message in difﬁcult ﬁelds. Under the blessing of God, and the wise
          training of Barnabas, he developed into a valuable worker. Paul was afterward reconciled to Mark and received
          him as a fellow laborer.</p>
