    <h1>Asa Trusted God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Chronicles 14</strong></p>
      <p>And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or
          with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this
          multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. 2 Chronicles 14:11.</p>
      <p>The faith of Asa was put to a severe test when “Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and
          three hundred chariots,” invaded his kingdom. In this crisis Asa did not put his trust in the “fenced cities
          in Judah” that he had built, with “walls, and towers, gates, and bars,” nor in the “mighty men of valor” in
          his carefully trained army. The king’s trust was in Jehovah of hosts.... Setting</p>
      <p>his forces in battle array, he sought the help of God.</p>
      <p>The opposing armies now stood face to face. It was a time of test and trial to those who served the Lord. Had
          every sin been confessed? Had the men of Judah full conﬁdence in God’s power to deliver? Such thoughts as
          these were in the minds of the leaders. From every human viewpoint the vast host from Egypt would sweep
          everything before it. But in time of peace Asa had not been giving himself to amusement and pleasure; he had
          been preparing for any emergency. He had an army trained for conﬂict; he had endeavored to lead his people to
          make their peace with God. And now, although his forces were fewer in number than the enemy, his faith in the
          One whom he had made his trust did not weaken.</p>
      <p>Having sought the Lord in the days of prosperity, the king could now rely upon Him in the day of adversity. His
          petitions showed that he was not a stranger to God’s wonderful power....</p>
      <p>The prayer of Asa is one that every Christian believer may ﬁttingly offer....</p>
      <p>In life’s conﬂict we must meet evil agencies that have arrayed themselves against the right. Our hope is not in
          man, but in the living God. With full assurance of faith we may expect that He will unite His omnipotence with
          the efforts of human instrumentalities, for the glory of His name. Clad with the armor of His righteousness,
          we may gain the victory over every foe.</p>
