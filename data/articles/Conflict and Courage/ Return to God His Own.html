    <h1>Return to God His Own</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>28:16-22</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will
          surely give the tenth unto thee. Genesis 28:22.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the custom of commemorating important events, Jacob set up a memorial of God’s mercy, that
          whenever he should pass that way he might tarry at this sacred spot to worship the Lord.... With deep
          gratitude he repeated</p>
      <p>the promise that God’s presence would be with him; and then he made the solemn vow, “If God will be with me,
          and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come
          again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a
          pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth upon thee.”</p>
      <p>Jacob was not here seeking to make terms with God. The Lord had already promised him prosperity, and this vow
          was the outﬂow of a heart ﬁlled with gratitude for the assurance of God’s love and mercy. Jacob felt that God
          had claims upon him which he must acknowledge, and that the special tokens of divine favor granted him
          demanded a return. So does every blessing bestowed upon us call for a response to the Author of all our
          mercies. The Christian should often review his past life and recall with gratitude the precious deliverances
          that God has wrought for him, supporting him in trial, opening ways before him when all seemed dark and
          forbidding, refreshing him when ready to faint. He should recognize all of them as evidences of the watchcare
          of heavenly angels. In view of these innumerable blessings he should often ask, with subdued and grateful
          heart, “What shall I render unto the Lord for all His beneﬁts toward me?” (Psalm 116:12).</p>
      <p>Our time, our talents, our property, should be sacredly devoted to Him who has given us these blessings in
          trust. Whenever a special deliverance is wrought in our behalf, or new and unexpected favors are granted us,
          we should acknowledge God’s goodness, not only by expressing our gratitude in words, but, like Jacob, by gifts
          and offerings to His cause. As we are continually receiving the blessings of God, so we are to be continually
          giving.</p>
