    <h1>Toward Sodom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>13:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward
          Sodom. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. Genesis 12:12, 13.</p>
      <p>The most fertile region in all Palestine was the Jordan valley.... There were</p>
      <p>cities also, wealthy and beautiful, inviting to proﬁtable trafﬁc in their crowded marts. Dazzled with visions
          of worldly gain, Lot overlooked the moral and spiritual evils that would be encountered there.... He “chose
          him all the plain</p>
      <p>of Jordan,” and “pitched his tent toward Sodom.” How little did he foresee the terrible results of that selﬁsh
          choice!</p>
      <p>Lot chose Sodom for his home because he saw that there were advantages to be gained there from a worldly point
          of view. But after he had established himself, and grown rich in earthly treasure, he was convinced that he
          had made a mistake in not taking into consideration the moral standing of the community in which he was to
          make his home.</p>
      <p>The dwellers in Sodom were corrupt; vile conversation greeted his ears daily, and his righteous soul was vexed
          by the violence and crime he was powerless to prevent. His children were becoming like these wicked people,
          for association with them had perverted their morals. Taking all these things into consideration, the worldly
          riches he had gained seemed small and not worth the price he had paid for them. His family connections were
          extensive, his children having married among the Sodomites. The Lord’s anger was ﬁnally kindled against the
          wicked inhabitants of the city, and angels of God visited Sodom to bring forth Lot, that he should not perish
          in the overthrow of the city.</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of his wife and the associations of that wicked city would have led him to apostatize from God had
          it not been for the faithful instruction he had early received from Abraham. The marriage of Lot and his
          choice of Sodom for a home were the ﬁrst links in a chain of events fraught with evil to the world for many
          generations.</p>
      <p>It is Satan’s purpose to attract men and women to the cities, and to gain his object he invents every kind of
          novelty and amusement, every kind of excitement. And the cities of the earth today are becoming as were the
          cities before the Flood.</p>
