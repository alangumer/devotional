    <h1>A Home in Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>37:1-11</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him. Genesis
          37:4.</p>
      <p>The sin of Jacob, and the train of events to which it led, had not failed to exert an inﬂuence for
          <nobr>evil—an</nobr> inﬂuence that revealed its bitter fruit in the character and life of his sons. As these
          sons arrived at manhood they developed serious faults. The results of polygamy were manifest in the household.
          This terrible evil tends to dry up the very springs of love, and its inﬂuence weakens the most sacred ties.
          The jealousy of the several mothers had embittered the family relation, the children had grown up contentious
          and impatient of control, and the father’s life was darkened with anxiety and grief.</p>
      <p>There was one, however, of a widely different <nobr>character—the</nobr> elder son of Rachel, Joseph, whose
          rare personal beauty seemed but to reﬂect an inward beauty of mind and heart. Pure, active, and joyous, the
          lad gave evidence also of moral earnestness and ﬁrmness. He listened to his father’s instructions, and loved
          to obey God.... His mother being dead, his affections clung the more closely to the</p>
      <p>father, and Jacob’s heart was bound up in this child of his old age. He “loved Joseph more than all his
          children.”</p>
      <p>But even this affection was to become a cause of trouble and sorrow. Jacob unwisely manifested his preference
          for Joseph, and this excited the jealousy of his other sons.... The father’s injudicious gift to Joseph of a
          costly coat, or tunic,</p>
      <p>... excited a suspicion that he intended to pass by his elder children, to bestow the birthright upon the son
          of Rachel. Their malice was still further increased as the boy one day told them of a dream that he had
          had....</p>
      <p>As the lad stood before his brothers, his beautiful countenance lighted up with the Spirit of Inspiration, they
          could not withhold their admiration; but they did not choose to renounce their evil ways, and they hated the
          purity that reproved their sins. The same spirit that actuated Cain was kindling in their hearts.</p>
