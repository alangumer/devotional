    <h1>Too Drunk to Care</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Leviticus <nobr>10:1-11</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. Proverbs 20:1.</p>
      <p>Nadab and Abihu would never have committed that fatal sin had they not ﬁrst become partially intoxicated by the
          free use of wine. They understood that the most careful and solemn preparation was necessary before presenting
          themselves in the sanctuary, where the divine Presence was manifested; but by intemperance they were
          disqualiﬁed for their holy ofﬁce. Their minds became confused and their moral perceptions dulled so that they
          could not discern the difference between the sacred and the common. To Aaron and his surviving sons was given
          the warning: “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, ... that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
          between unclean and clean....” The</p>
      <p>use of spirituous liquors has the effect to weaken the body, confuse the mind, and debase the morals. It
          prevents men from realizing the sacredness of holy things or the binding force of God’s requirements. All who
          occupied positions of sacred responsibility were to be men of strict temperance, that their minds might be
          clear to discriminate between right and wrong, that they might possess ﬁrmness of principle, and wisdom to
          administer justice and to show mercy.</p>
      <p>The same obligation rests upon every follower of Christ.... To the church of</p>
      <p>Christ in all ages is addressed the solemn and fearful warning, “If any man deﬁle the temple of God, him shall
          God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are” (1 Corinthians 3:17).</p>
      <p>The case of Aaron’s sons has been placed upon record for the beneﬁt of God’s people, and should teach those
          especially who are preparing for the second coming of Christ, that the indulgence of a depraved appetite
          destroys the ﬁne feelings of the soul, and so affects the reasoning powers which God has given to man, that
          spiritual and holy things lose their sacredness. Disobedience looks pleasing, instead of exceeding
          sinful.</p>
