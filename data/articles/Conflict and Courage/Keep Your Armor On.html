    <h1>Keep Your Armor On</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will
          bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you. Isaiah 46:4.</strong></p>
      <p>The history of John affords a striking illustration of the way in which God can use aged workers. When John was
          exiled to the Isle of Patmos, there were many who thought him to be past service, an old and broken reed,
          ready to fall at any time. But the Lord saw ﬁt to use him still. Though banished from the scenes of his former
          labor, he did not cease to bear witness to the truth. Even in Patmos he made friends and converts. His was a
          message of joy, proclaiming a risen Saviour....</p>
      <p>The most tender regard should be cherished for those whose life interest has been bound up with the work of
          God. These aged workers have stood faithful amid storm and trial. They may have inﬁrmities, but they still
          possess talents that qualify them to stand in their place in God’s cause. Though worn, and unable to bear the
          heavier burdens that younger men can and should carry, the counsel they can give is of the highest value.</p>
      <p>They may have made mistakes, but from their failures they have learned to avoid errors and dangers, and are
          they not therefore competent to give wise counsel? They have borne test and trial, and though they have lost
          some of their vigor, the Lord does not lay them aside. He gives them special grace and wisdom.... The Lord
          desires the younger laborers to gain wisdom, strength, and</p>
      <p>maturity by association with these faithful men....</p>
      <p>As those who have spent their lives in the service of Christ draw near to the close of their earthly ministry,
          they will be impressed by the Holy Spirit to recount the experiences they have had in connection with the work
          of God. The record of His wonderful dealings with His people, of His great goodness in delivering them from
          trial, should be repeated to those newly come to the faith. God desires the old and tried laborers to stand in
          their place, doing their part to save men and women from being swept downward by the mighty current of evil.
          He desires them to keep the armor on till He bids them lay it down.</p>
