    <h1>“More Blessed to Give”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>17:8-24</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19.</p>
      <p>Read the story of the widow of Sarepta. To this woman in a heathen land God sent His servant in time of famine
          to ask for food.... Wonderful was the</p>
      <p>hospitality shown to God’s prophet by this Phoenician woman, and wonderfully were her faith and generosity
          rewarded....</p>
      <p>God has not changed. His power is no less now than in the days of Elijah....</p>
      <p>To His faithful servants today as well as to His ﬁrst disciples Christ’s words apply: “He that receiveth you
          receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me” (Matthew 10:40). No act of kindness shown
          in His name will fail to be recognized and rewarded. And in the same tender recognition Christ includes even
          the feeblest and lowliest of the family of God. “Whosoever shall give to drink,” He says, “unto one of these
          little <nobr>ones”—those</nobr> who are as children in their faith and their knowledge of
          <nobr>Christ—“a</nobr> cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no
          wise lose his reward” (Matthew 10:42).</p>
      <p>Poverty need not shut us out from showing hospitality. We are to impart what we have. There are those who
          struggle for a livelihood and who have great difﬁculty in making their income meet their necessities; but they
          love Jesus in the person of His saints and are ready to show hospitality to believers and unbelievers, trying
          to make their visits proﬁtable. At the family board and the family altar the guests are made welcome. The
          season of prayer makes its impression on those who receive entertainment, and even one visit may mean the
          saving of a soul from death. For this work the Lord makes a reckoning, saying: “I will repay.” ...</p>
      <p>“Man doth not live by bread only,” and as we impart to others our temporal food, so we are to impart hope and
          courage and Christlike love.... And the</p>
      <p>assurance is ours: “God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufﬁciency in
          all things, may abound to every good work” (2 Corinthians 9:8).</p>
