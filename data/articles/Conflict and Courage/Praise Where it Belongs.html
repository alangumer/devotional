      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>10:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the Lord
          loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. 1 Kings 10:9.</p>
      <p>A Greater than Solomon was the designer of the temple; the wisdom and glory of God stood there revealed. Those
          who were unacquainted with this fact naturally admired and praised Solomon as the architect and builder; but
          the king disclaimed any honor for its conception or erection.</p>
      <p>Thus it was when the Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon. Hearing of his wisdom and of the magniﬁcent temple
          he had built, she determined “to prove him with hard questions” and to see for herself his famous works.
          Attended by a retinue of servants, and with camels bearing “spices, and gold in abundance, and precious
          stones,” she made the long journey to Jerusalem. “And when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of
          all that was in her heart.” She talked with him of the mysteries of nature; and Solomon taught her of the God
          of nature, the great Creator, who dwells in the highest heaven and rules over all. “Solomon told her all her
          questions: there was not anything hid from the king, which he told her not.”</p>
      <p>“When the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built, ... there was no more
          spirit in her.” “It was a true report,” she acknowledged, “which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and
          of thy wisdom: howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it:” “and, behold, the
          half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.” ...</p>
      <p>By the time of the close of her visit the queen had been so fully taught by Solomon as to the source of his
          wisdom and prosperity that she was constrained, not to extol the human agent, but to exclaim, “Blessed be the
          Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel
          forever, therefore made He thee king, to do judgment and justice.” This is the impression that God designed
          should be made upon all peoples.</p>
