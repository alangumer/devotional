    <h1>Toward the Mark</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things
          which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
          Philippians 3:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>Paul did many things. He was a wise teacher. His many letters are full of instructive lessons setting forth
          correct principles. He worked with his hands, for he was a <nobr>tent-maker,</nobr> and in this way earned his
          daily bread.... He carried a heavy</p>
      <p>burden for the churches. He strove most earnestly to present their errors before them, that they might correct
          them, and not be deceived and led away from God. He was always seeking to help them in their difﬁculties; and
          yet he declares, “One thing I do.” ... The responsibilities of his life were many, yet he kept always before
          him this “one thing.” The constant sense of the presence of God constrained him to keep his eye ever looking
          unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of his faith.</p>
      <p>The great purpose that constrained Paul to press forward in the face of hardship and difﬁculty should lead
          every Christian worker to consecrate himself wholly to God’s service. Worldly attractions will be presented to
          draw his attention from the Saviour, but he is to press on toward the goal, showing to the world, to angels,
          and to men that the hope of seeing the face of God is worth all the effort and sacriﬁce that the attainment of
          this hope demands.</p>
      <p>The lowliest disciple of Christ may become an inhabitant of heaven, an heir of God to an inheritance
          incorruptible, and that fadeth not away. O that every one might make choice of the heavenly gift, become an
          heir of God to that inheritance whose title is secure from any destroyer, world without end! O, choose not the
          world, but choose the better inheritance! Press, urge your way toward the mark for the prize of your high
          calling in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Soon we shall witness the coronation of our King. Those whose lives have been hidden with Christ, those who on
          this earth have fought the good ﬁght of faith, will shine forth with the Redeemer’s glory in the kingdom of
          God.</p>
