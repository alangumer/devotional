    <h1>Cain “Went Out”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>4:8-16</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord. Genesis 4:16.</p>
      <p>God had given Cain an opportunity to confess his sin.... He knew the enormity</p>
      <p>of the deed he had done, and of the falsehood he had uttered to conceal it; but he was rebellious still, and
          sentence was no longer deferred....</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding that Cain had by his crimes merited the sentence of death, a merciful Creator still spared his
          life, and granted him opportunity for repentance. But Cain lived only to harden his heart, to encourage
          rebellion against the divine authority, and to become the head of a line of bold, abandoned sinners. This one
          apostate, led on by Satan, became a tempter to others; and his example and inﬂuence exerted their demoralizing
          power, until the earth became so corrupt and ﬁlled with violence as to call for its destruction....</p>
      <p>Upon receiving the curse of God, Cain had withdrawn from his father’s household.... He had gone out from the
          presence of the Lord, cast away the</p>
      <p>promise of the restored Eden, to seek his possessions and enjoyment in the earth under the curse of sin, thus
          standing at the head of that great class of men who worship the God of this world. In that which pertains to
          mere earthly and material progress, his descendants became distinguished. But they were regardless of God, and
          in opposition to His purposes for man.</p>
      <p>In sparing the life of Cain the murderer, God gave the world an example of what would be the result of
          permitting the sinner to live to continue a course of unbridled iniquity. Through the inﬂuence of Cain’s
          teaching and example, multitudes of his descendants were led into sin, until “the wickedness of man was great
          in the earth,” and “every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.”</p>
      <p>As Cain went out from the presence of the Lord to seek his home; as the prodigal wandered into the “far
          country,” so do sinners seek happiness in forgetfulness of God.</p>
