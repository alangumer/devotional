    <h1>Hands Toward Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>17:8-16</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 1 Timothy
          2:8.</p>
      <p>Because of Israel’s disobedience and departure from God, they were allowed to be brought into close places and
          to suffer adversity; their enemies were permitted to make war with them, to humble them and lead them to seek
          God in their trouble and distress....</p>
      <p>When Israel was assailed by the Amalekites, Moses gave Joshua directions to ﬁght with their enemies.</p>
      <p>Moses and Aaron and Hur were stationed on a hill overlooking the battleﬁeld. With arms outstretched toward
          heaven, and holding the rod of God in his right hand, Moses prayed for the success of the armies of Israel. As
          the battle progressed, it was observed that so long as his hands were reaching upward, Israel prevailed, but
          when they were lowered, the enemy was victorious. As Moses became weary, Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands
          until the going down of the sun, when the enemy was put to ﬂight.</p>
      <p>As Aaron and Hur supported the hands of Moses, they showed the people their duty to sustain him in his arduous
          work while he should receive the word from God to speak to them. And the act of Moses also was signiﬁcant,
          showing that God held their destiny in His hands; while they made Him their trust, He would ﬁght for them and
          subdue their enemies; but when they should let go their hold upon Him, and trust in their own power, they
          would be even weaker than those who had not the knowledge of God, and their foes would prevail against
          them.</p>
      <p>As the Hebrews triumphed when Moses was reaching his hands toward heaven and interceding in their behalf, so
          the Israel of God prevail when they by faith take hold upon the strength of their mighty Helper. Yet divine
          strength is to be combined with human effort. Moses did not believe that God would overcome their foes while
          Israel remained inactive. While the great leader was pleading with the Lord, Joshua and his brave followers
          were putting forth their utmost efforts to repulse the enemies of Israel and of God.</p>
