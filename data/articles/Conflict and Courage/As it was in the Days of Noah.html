    <h1>As it was in the Days of Noah</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>6:5-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank,
          they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the ﬂood
          came, and destroyed them all. Luke 17:26, 27.</p>
      <p>God did not condemn the antediluvians for eating and drinking; He had given them the fruits of the earth in
          great abundance to supply their physical wants. Their sin consisted in taking these gifts without gratitude to
          the Giver, and debasing themselves by indulging appetite without restraint. It was lawful for them to marry.
          Marriage was in God’s order; it was one of the ﬁrst institutions which He established. He gave special
          directions concerning this ordinance, clothing it with sanctity and beauty; but these directions were
          forgotten, and marriage was perverted and made to minister to passion.</p>
      <p>A similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful in itself is carried to excess. Appetite is
          indulged without restraint.... Multitudes feel under</p>
      <p>no moral obligation to curb their sensual desires, and they become the slaves of lust. Men are living for the
          pleasures of sense; for this world and this life alone....</p>
      <p>The picture which Inspiration has given of the antediluvian world represents too truly the condition to which
          modern society is fast hastening....</p>
      <p>As the time of their probation was closing, the antediluvians gave themselves up to exciting amusements and
          festivities. Those who possessed inﬂuence and power were bent on keeping the minds of the people engrossed
          with mirth and pleasure, lest any should be impressed by the last solemn warning.</p>
      <p>Before the Flood God sent Noah to warn the world, that the people might be led to repentance, and thus escape
          the threatened destruction. As the time of Christ’s second appearing draws near, the Lord sends His servants
          with a warning to the world to prepare for that great event. Multitudes have been living in transgression of
          God’s law, and now He in mercy calls them to obey its sacred precepts. All who will put away their sins by
          repentance toward God and faith in Christ are offered pardon.</p>
