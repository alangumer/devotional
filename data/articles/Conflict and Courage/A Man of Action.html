    <h1>A Man of Action</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Nehemiah <nobr>2:1-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>It pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. Nehemiah 2:6. While Nehemiah implored the help of God, he
          did not fold his own hands,</p>
      <p>feeling that he had no more care or responsibility in the bringing about of his purpose to restore Jerusalem.
          With admirable prudence and forethought he proceeded to make all the arrangements necessary to insure the
          success of the enterprise....</p>
      <p>The example of this holy man should be a lesson to all the people of God, that they are not only to pray in
          faith, but to work with diligence and ﬁdelity. How many difﬁculties we encounter, how often we hinder the
          working of Providence in our behalf, because prudence, forethought, and painstaking are regarded as having
          little to do with religion! This is a grave mistake. It is our duty to cultivate and to exercise every power
          that will render us more efﬁcient workers for God. Careful consideration and <nobr>well-matured</nobr> plans
          are as essential to the success of sacred enterprises today as in the time of Nehemiah.... Men of prayer
          should</p>
      <p>be men of action. Those who are ready and willing, will ﬁnd ways and means of working. Nehemiah did not depend
          upon uncertainties. The means which he lacked he solicited from those who were able to bestow.</p>
      <p>The Lord still moves upon the hearts of kings and rulers in behalf of His people. Those who are laboring for
          Him are to avail themselves of the help that He prompts men to give for the advancements of His cause....
          These men may</p>
      <p>have no sympathy with God’s work, no faith in Christ, no acquaintance with His word; but their gifts are not on
          this account to be refused....</p>
      <p>As long as we are in this world, as long as the Spirit of God strives with the children of men, so long are we
          to receive favors as well as to impart them. We are to give to the world the light of truth, as revealed in
          the Scriptures; and we are to receive from the world that which God moves upon them to give in behalf of His
          cause.... O that Christians might realize more and still more fully that it is</p>
      <p>their privilege and their duty, while cherishing right principles, to take advantage of every
          <nobr>Heaven-sent</nobr> opportunity for advancing God’s kingdom in this world!</p>
