    <h1>From Doubt to Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>4:46-54</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. John 4:48.</p>
      <p>Like a ﬂash of light, the Saviour’s words to the nobleman laid bare his heart. He saw that his motives in
          seeking Jesus were selﬁsh. His vacillating faith appeared to him in its true character. In deep distress he
          realized that his doubt might cost the life of his son. He knew that he was in the presence of One who could
          read the thoughts, and to whom all things were possible. In an agony of supplication he cried, “Sir, come down
          ere my child die.” His faith took hold upon Christ as did Jacob, when, wrestling with the Angel, he cried, “I
          will not let thee go, except thou bless me” (Genesis 32:26).</p>
      <p>Like Jacob he prevailed. The Saviour cannot withdraw from the soul that clings to Him, pleading its great need.
          “Go thy way,” He said: “thy son liveth.” The nobleman left the Saviour’s presence with a peace and joy he had
          never known before. Not only did he believe that his son would be restored, but....</p>
      <p>he trusted in Christ as the Redeemer....</p>
      <p>Like the afﬂicted father, we are often led to seek Jesus by the desire for some earthly good; and upon the
          granting of our request we rest our conﬁdence in His love. The Saviour longs to give us a greater blessing
          than we ask; and He delays the answer to our request that He may show us the evil of our own hearts, and our
          deep need of His grace. He desires us to renounce the selﬁshness that leads us to seek Him. Confessing our
          helplessness and bitter need, we are to trust ourselves wholly to His love.</p>
      <p>The nobleman wanted to see the fulﬁllment of his prayer before he should believe; but he had to accept the word
          of Jesus that his request was heard and the blessing granted. This lesson we also have to learn.</p>
      <p>The day is just before us when Satan will ... present numerous miracles to conﬁrm the faith of all those who
          are seeking this kind of evidence. How terrible will be the situation of those who close their eyes to the
          light of truth and ask for miracles to establish them in deception!</p>
