      <p><strong>2 Kings <nobr>2:1-15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the
          twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
          incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52.</p>
      <p>In the desert, in loneliness and discouragement, Elijah had said that he had had enough of life and had prayed
          that he might die. But the Lord in His mercy had not taken him at his word. There was yet a great work for
          Elijah to do; and when his work was done, he was not to perish in discouragement and solitude. Not for him the
          descent into the tomb, but the ascent with God’s angels to the presence of His glory.</p>
      <p>“And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he
          saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up also the mantle
          of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; and he took the mantle of Elijah
          that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had
          smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. And when the sons of the prophets
          which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The Spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to
          meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.”</p>
      <p>When the Lord in His providence sees ﬁt to remove from His work those to whom He has given wisdom, He helps and
          strengthens their successors, if they will look to Him for aid and will walk in His ways. They may be even
          wiser than their predecessors; for they may proﬁt by their experience and learn wisdom from their
          mistakes.</p>
      <p>Elijah, the man of power, had been God’s instrument for the overthrow of gigantic evils.... As successor to
          Elijah was needed one who by careful, patient</p>
      <p>instruction could guide Israel in safe paths. For this work Elisha’s early training under God’s direction had
          prepared him....</p>
      <p>Every act of life is a revelation of character, and he only who in small duties proves himself “a workman that
          needeth not to be ashamed,” will be honored by God with weightier trusts.</p>
