    <h1>Pilate</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>27:11-26</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>When Pilate realized that nothing more could be done but that there would soon be a riot, he took a bowl of
          water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I take no responsibility for the death of this man. You
          must see to that yourselves.” Matthew 27:24, Phillips.</p>
      <p>If at the ﬁrst Pilate had stood ﬁrm, refusing to condemn a man whom he found guiltless, he would have broken
          the fatal chain that was to bind him in remorse and guilt as long as he lived. Had he carried out his
          convictions of right, the Jews would not have presumed to dictate to him. Christ would have been put to death,
          but the guilt would not have rested upon Pilate. But Pilate had taken step after step in the violation of his
          conscience. He had excused himself from judging with justice and equity, and he now found himself almost
          helpless in the hands of the priests and rulers. His wavering and indecision proved his ruin.</p>
      <p>In fear and <nobr>self-condemnation</nobr> Pilate looked upon the Saviour. In the vast sea of upturned faces,
          His alone was peaceful. About His head a soft light seemed to shine. Pilate said in his heart, He is a God.
          Turning to the multitude he declared, I am clear of His blood. Take ye Him, and crucify Him. But ... I
          pronounce Him a just man. May He whom He claims as His Father judge you and not me for this day’s work. Then
          to Jesus he said, Forgive me for this act; I cannot save You....</p>
      <p>Pilate longed to deliver Jesus. But he saw that he could not do this, and yet retain his own position and
          honor. Rather than lose his worldly power, he chose to sacriﬁce an innocent life. How many, to escape loss or
          suffering, in like manner sacriﬁce principle. Conscience and duty point one way, and
          <nobr>self-interest</nobr> points another....</p>
      <p>Pilate yielded to the demands of the mob. Rather than risk losing his position, he delivered Jesus up to be
          cruciﬁed. But ... the very thing he dreaded afterward came upon him. His honors were stripped from him, he was
          cast down from his high ofﬁce, and, stung by remorse and wounded pride, not long after the cruciﬁxion he ended
          his own life. So all who compromise with sin will gain only sorrow and ruin. “There is a way which seemeth
          right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death” (Proverbs 14:12).</p>
