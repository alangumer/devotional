    <h1>Judas, Self-Seeking Disciple</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>John <nobr>6:64-71</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not,
          and who should betray him. John 6:64.</p>
      <p>While Jesus was preparing the disciples for their ordination, one who had not been summoned urged his presence
          among them. It was Judas Iscariot, a man who professed to be a follower of Christ.... Judas believed Jesus to
          be the Messiah; and</p>
      <p>by joining the apostles, he hoped to secure a high position in the new kingdom....</p>
      <p>The disciples were anxious that Judas should become one of their number. He was of commanding appearance, a man
          of keen discernment and executive ability, and they commended him to Jesus as one who would greatly assist Him
          in His work.... The after history of Judas would show them the danger of allowing</p>
      <p>any worldly consideration to have weight in deciding the ﬁtness of men for the work of God....</p>
      <p>Yet when Judas joined the disciples, he was not insensible to the beauty of the character of Christ. He felt
          the inﬂuence of that divine power which was drawing souls to the Saviour.... The Saviour read the heart of
          Judas; He knew the depths</p>
      <p>of iniquity to which, unless delivered by the grace of God, Judas would sink. In connecting this man with
          Himself, He placed him where he might, day by day, be brought in contact with the outﬂowing of His own
          unselﬁsh love. If he would open his heart to Christ, divine grace would banish the demon of selﬁshness, and
          even Judas might become a subject of the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>God takes men as they are ... and trains them for His service, if they will be disciplined and learn of Him.
          They are not chosen because they are perfect, but notwithstanding their imperfections, that through the
          knowledge and practice of the truth, through the grace of Christ, they may become transformed into His
          image.</p>
      <p>Judas had the same opportunities as had the other disciples. He listened to the same precious lessons. But the
          practice of the truth, which Christ required, was at variance with the desires and purposes of Judas, and he
          would not yield his ideas in order to receive wisdom from Heaven.</p>
