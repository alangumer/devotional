    <h1>At the Crossroads</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had
          heard of his wisdom. 1 Kings 4:34.</strong></p>
      <p>In the days of Solomon the kingdom of Israel extended from Hamath on the north to Egypt on the south, and from
          the Mediterranean Sea to the river Euphrates. Through this territory ran many natural highways of the world’s
          commerce, and caravans from distant lands were constantly passing to and fro. Thus there was given to Solomon
          and his people opportunity to reveal to men of all nations the character of the King of kings, and to teach
          them to reverence and obey Him....</p>
      <p>Placed at the head of a nation that had been set as a beacon light to the surrounding nations, Solomon should
          have used his <nobr>God-given</nobr> wisdom and power of inﬂuence in organizing and directing a great movement
          for the enlightenment of those who were ignorant of God and His truth. Thus multitudes would have been won to
          allegiance to the divine precepts, Israel would have been shielded from the evils practiced by the heathen,
          and the Lord of glory would have been greatly honored. But Solomon lost sight of this high purpose. He failed
          of improving his splendid opportunities for enlightening those who were continually passing through his
          territory or tarrying at the principal cities.</p>
      <p>The missionary spirit that God had implanted in the heart of Solomon and in the hearts of all true Israelites
          was supplanted by a spirit of commercialism. The opportunities afforded by contact with many nations, were
          used for personal aggrandizement....</p>
      <p>In this our day the opportunities for coming into contact with men and women of all classes and many
          nationalities are much greater than in the days of Israel. The thoroughfares of travel have multiplied a
          thousandfold. Like Christ, the messengers of the Most High today should take their position in these great
          thoroughfares, where they can meet the passing multitudes from all parts of the world. Like Him, hiding self
          in God, they are to sow the gospel seed, presenting before others the precious truths of Holy Scripture that
          will take deep root in mind and heart, and spring up unto life eternal.</p>
