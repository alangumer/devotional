      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>33:1-16</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath
          forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.</p>
      <p>While Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another heavenly messenger was sent to Esau. In a dream, Esau beheld
          his brother for twenty years an exile from his father’s house; he witnessed his grief at ﬁnding his mother
          dead; he saw him encompassed by the hosts of God. This dream was related by Esau to his soldiers, with the
          charge not to harm Jacob, for the God of his father was with him.</p>
      <p>The two companies at last approached each other, the desert chief leading his men of war, and Jacob with his
          wives and children, attended by shepherds and handmaidens, and followed by long lines of ﬂocks and herds.
          Leaning upon his staff, the patriarch went forward to meet the band of soldiers. He was pale and disabled from
          his recent conﬂict, and he walked slowly and painfully, halting at every step; but his countenance was lighted
          up with joy and peace.</p>
      <p>At sight of that crippled sufferer, “Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed
          him: and they wept.” As they looked upon the scene, even the hearts of Esau’s rude soldiers were touched.
          Notwithstanding he had told them of his dream, they could not account for the change that had come over their
          captain. Though they beheld the patriarch’s inﬁrmity, they little thought that this his weakness had been made
          his strength.</p>
      <p>In his night of anguish beside the Jabbok, when destruction seemed just before him, Jacob had been taught how
          vain is the help of man, how groundless is all trust in human power. He saw that his only help must come from
          Him against whom he had so grievously sinned. Helpless and unworthy, he pleaded God’s promise of mercy to the
          repentant sinner. That promise was his assurance that God would pardon and accept him. Sooner might heaven and
          earth pass than that word could fail; and it was this that sustained him through that fearful conﬂict.</p>
