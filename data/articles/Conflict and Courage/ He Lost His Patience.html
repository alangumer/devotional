    <h1>He Lost His Patience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers <nobr>20:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. James 1:4.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Moses was the meekest man that lived upon the earth, on one occasion he drew the
          displeasure of God upon himself.... The</p>
      <p>undeserved reproaches of the people which fell upon him led him for a moment to forget that their murmuring was
          not against him, but against God; and instead of being grieved because the Spirit of God was insulted, he
          became irritated, offended, and in a <nobr>self-willed,</nobr> impatient manner struck the rock twice saying:
          “Hear now, ye rebels, must we fetch you water out of this rock?” ...</p>
      <p>Moses revealed great weakness before the people. He showed a marked lack of <nobr>self-control,</nobr> a spirit
          similar to that possessed by the murmurers. He should have been an example of forbearance and patience before
          that multitude, who were ready to excuse their failures, disaffections, and unreasonable murmurings, on
          account of this exhibition of wrong on his part. The greatest sin consisted in assuming to take the place of
          God. The position of honor that Moses had heretofore occupied did not lessen his guilt, but greatly magniﬁed
          it. Here was a man hitherto blameless, now fallen. Many in a similar position would reason that their sin
          would be overlooked because of their long life of unwavering ﬁdelity. But no; it was a more serious matter for
          a man who had been honored of God to show weakness of character in the exhibition of passion than if he had
          occupied a less responsible position. Moses was a representative of Christ, but how sadly was the ﬁgure
          marred! Moses had sinned, and his past ﬁdelity could not atone for the present sin.... Moses and Aaron must
          die without entering Canaan, subjected</p>
      <p>to the same punishment that fell upon those in a more lowly position. They bowed in submission, though with
          anguish of heart that was inexpressible; but their love for and conﬁdence in God was unshaken.... But few
          realize the sinfulness of sin....</p>
      <p>The cases of Moses and Aaron ... show that it is not a safe thing to sin in word or thought or deed.</p>
