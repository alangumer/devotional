      <p><strong>1 Samuel 15</strong></p>
      <p>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the
          lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. 1 Samuel 15:9.</p>
      <p>Since the defeat of the Philistines at Michmash, Saul had made war against Moab, Ammon, and Edom, and against
          the Amalekites and the Philistines; and wherever he turned his arms, he gained fresh victories. On receiving
          the commission against the Amalekites, he at once proclaimed war. To his own authority was added that of the
          prophet, and at the call to battle the men of Israel ﬂocked to his standard. The expedition was not to be
          entered upon for the purpose of <nobr>self-aggrandizement;</nobr> the Israelites were not to receive either
          the honor of the conquest or the spoils of their enemies. They were to engage in the war solely as an act of
          obedience to God, for the purpose of executing His judgment upon the Amalekites. God intended that all nations
          should behold the doom of that people that had deﬁed His sovereignty, and should mark that they were destroyed
          by the very people whom they had despised....</p>
      <p>This victory over the Amalekites was the most brilliant victory that Saul had ever gained, and it served to
          rekindle the pride of heart that was his greatest peril. The divine edict devoting the enemies of God to utter
          destruction was but partially fulﬁlled. Ambitious to heighten the honor of his triumphal return by the
          presence of a royal captive, Saul ventured to imitate the customs of the nations around him and spared Agag,
          the ﬁerce and warlike king of the Amalekites. The people reserved for themselves the ﬁnest of the ﬂocks,
          herds, and beasts of burden, excusing their sin on the ground that the cattle were reserved to be offered as
          sacriﬁces to the Lord. It was their purpose, however, to use these merely as a substitute, to save their own
          cattle.</p>
      <p>Saul had now been subjected to the ﬁnal test. His presumptuous disregard of the will of God, showing his
          determination to rule as an independent monarch, proved that he could not be trusted with royal power as the
          vicegerent of the Lord.</p>
