    <h1>Giants in the Land</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>6:1-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>There were giants in the earth in those days. Genesis 6:4.</p>
      <p>The ﬁrst people upon the earth received their instructions from that inﬁnite God who created the world. Those
          who received their knowledge direct from inﬁnite wisdom were not deﬁcient in knowledge....</p>
      <p>There are many inventions and improvements, and <nobr>labor-saving</nobr> machines now that the ancients did
          not have. They did not need them....</p>
      <p>Men before the ﬂood lived many hundreds of years, and when one hundred years old were considered but youths.
          Those <nobr>long-lived</nobr> men had sound minds in sound bodies.... They came upon the stage of action from
          the ages of sixty to one</p>
      <p>hundred years, about the time those who now live the longest have acted their part in their little short life
          time, and have passed off the stage.</p>
      <p>There were many giants, men of great stature and strength, renowned for wisdom, skillful in devising the most
          cunning and wonderful works; but their guilt in giving loose rein to iniquity was in proportion to their skill
          and mental ability.</p>
      <p>God bestowed upon these antediluvians many and rich gifts; but they used His bounties to glorify themselves,
          and turned them into a curse by ﬁxing their affections upon the gifts instead of the Giver. They employed the
          gold and silver, the precious stones and the choice wood, in the construction of habitations for themselves,
          and endeavored to excel one another in beautifying their dwellings with the most skillful workmanship. They
          sought only to gratify the desires of their own proud hearts, and reveled in scenes of pleasure and
          wickedness.</p>
      <p>They became corrupt in their imagination, because they left God out of their plans and councils. They were wise
          to do what God had never told them to do, wise to do evil.... They used the probation so graciously granted
          them in</p>
      <p>ridiculing Noah. They caricatured him and criticized him. They laughed at him for his peculiar earnestness and
          intense feeling in regard to the judgments which he declared God would surely fulﬁll. They talked of science
          and of the laws controlling nature. Then they held a carnival over the words of Noah, calling him a crazy
          fanatic.</p>
