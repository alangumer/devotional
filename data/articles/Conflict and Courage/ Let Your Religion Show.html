      <p><strong>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
          perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. Philippians 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Abraham was honored by the surrounding nations as a mighty prince and a wise and able chief. He did not shut
          away his inﬂuence from his neighbors. His life and character, in their marked contrast with those of the
          worshipers of idols, exerted a telling inﬂuence in favor of the true faith. His allegiance to God was
          unswerving, while his affability and benevolence inspired conﬁdence and friendship and his unaffected
          greatness commanded respect and honor.</p>
      <p>His religion was not held as a precious treasure to be jealously guarded and enjoyed solely by the possessor.
          True religion cannot be thus held, for such a spirit is contrary to the principles of the gospel. While Christ
          is dwelling in the heart it is impossible to conceal the light of His presence, or for that light to grow dim.
          On the contrary, it will grow brighter and brighter as day by day the mists of selﬁshness and sin that envelop
          the soul are dispelled by the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness.</p>
      <p>The people of God are His representatives upon the earth, and He intends that they shall be lights in the moral
          darkness of this world. Scattered all over the country, in the towns, cities, and villages, they are God’s
          witnesses, the channels through which He will communicate to an unbelieving world the knowledge of His will
          and the wonders of His grace. It is His plan that all who are partakers of the great salvation shall be
          missionaries for Him. The piety of the Christian constitutes the standard by which worldlings judge the
          gospel. Trials patiently borne, blessings gratefully received, meekness, kindness, mercy, and love, habitually
          exhibited, are the lights that shine forth in the character before the world, revealing the contrast with the
          darkness that comes of the selﬁshness of the natural heart.</p>
