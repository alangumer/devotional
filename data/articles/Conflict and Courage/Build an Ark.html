    <h1>Build an Ark</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>6:5-22</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And God said unto Noah, The end of all ﬂesh is come before me; for the earth is ﬁlled with violence through
          them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark. Genesis 6:13, 14.</p>
      <p>God gave Noah the exact dimensions of the ark and explicit directions in regard to its construction in every
          particular. Human wisdom could not have devised a structure of so great strength and durability. God was the
          designer, and Noah the master builder. It was constructed like the hull of a ship, that it might ﬂoat upon the
          water, but in some respects it more nearly resembled a house.... The</p>
      <p>material employed in the construction of the ark was the cypress, or gopher wood, which would be untouched by
          decay for hundreds of years. The building of this immense structure was a slow and laborious process.</p>
      <p>The race of men then living were of very great stature, and possessed wonderful strength. The trees were vastly
          larger, and far surpassing in beauty and perfect proportions anything mortals can now look upon. The wood of
          these trees was of ﬁne grain and hard <nobr>substance—in</nobr> this respect more like stone. It required much
          more time and labor, even of that powerful race, to prepare the timber for building, than it requires in this
          degenerate age to prepare trees that are now growing upon the earth, even with the present weaker strength men
          now possess.</p>
      <p>Every piece of timber was closely ﬁtted, and every seam covered with pitch. All that men could do was done to
          make the work perfect; yet, after all, God alone could preserve the building upon the angry, heaving billows,
          by His miraculous power.</p>
      <p>Methuselah and his sons, and grandsons, lived in the time of the building of the ark. They, with some others,
          received instruction from Noah, and assisted him in building the ark.</p>
      <p>While Noah was giving his warning message to the world, his works testiﬁed of his sincerity. It was thus that
          his faith was perfected and made evident. He gave the world an example of believing just what God says. All
          that he possessed, he invested in the ark.... Every blow struck upon the ark was a witness to the people.</p>
