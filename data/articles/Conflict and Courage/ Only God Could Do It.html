      <p><strong>All the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down ﬂat. Joshua
          6:5.</strong></p>
      <p>At the taking of Jericho the mighty General of armies planned the battle in such simplicity that no human being
          could take the glory to himself. No human hand must cast down the walls of the city, lest man should take to
          himself the glory of victory. So today no human being is to take to himself glory for the work he
          accomplishes. The Lord alone is to be magniﬁed. Oh, that men would see the necessity for looking to God for
          their orders! ...</p>
      <p>The Lord marshaled His armies about the doomed city; no human hand was raised against it; the hosts of heaven
          overthrew its walls, that God’s name alone might have the glory. It was that proud city whose mighty bulwarks
          had struck terror to the unbelieving spies. Now in the capture of Jericho, God declared to the Hebrews that
          their fathers might have possessed the city forty years before, had they but trusted in Him.</p>
      <p>Men’s weakness shall ﬁnd supernatural strength and help in every stern conﬂict to do the deeds of Omnipotence,
          and perseverance in faith and perfect trust in God will ensure success. While the past confederacy of evil is
          arrayed against them He bids them to be brave and strong and ﬁght valiantly for they have a heaven to win, and
          they have more than an angel in their ranks, the mighty General of armies leads on the armies of heaven. As on
          the occasion of the taking of Jericho, not one of the armies of Israel could boast of exercising their ﬁnite
          strength to overthrow the walls of the city, but the Captain of the Lord’s host planned that battle in the
          greatest simplicity, that the Lord alone should receive the glory and man should not be exalted. God has
          promised us all power; for the promise is unto you and your children, and to all that are afar off, even as
          many as the Lord our God shall call.</p>
      <p>There must be continual faith and trust in the Captain of our salvation. We must obey His orders. The walls of
          Jericho came down as a result of obeying orders.</p>
