    <h1>Christ Sees Our Possibilities</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>7:36-50</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I tell you, Simon, that her sins, many as they are, are forgiven; for she has shown me so much love. But the
          man who has little to be forgiven has only a little love to give. Luke 7:47, Phillips.</p>
      <p>Mary had been looked upon as a great sinner, but Christ knew the circumstances that had shaped her life. He
          might have extinguished every spark of hope in her soul, but He did not. It was He who had lifted her from
          despair and ruin. Seven times she had heard His rebuke of the demons that controlled her heart and mind. She
          had heard His strong cries to the Father in her behalf. She knew how offensive is sin to His unsullied purity,
          and in His strength she had overcome.</p>
      <p>When to human eyes her case appeared hopeless, Christ saw in Mary capabilities for good. He saw the better
          traits of her character. The plan of redemption has invested humanity with great possibilities, and in Mary
          these possibilities were to be realized. Through His grace she became a partaker of the divine nature. The one
          who had fallen, and whose mind had been a habitation of demons, was brought very near to the Saviour in
          fellowship and ministry. It was Mary who sat at His feet and learned of Him. It was Mary who poured upon His
          head the precious anointing oil, and bathed His feet with her tears. Mary stood beside the cross, and followed
          Him to the sepulcher. Mary was ﬁrst at the tomb after His resurrection. It was Mary who ﬁrst proclaimed a
          risen Saviour.</p>
      <p>Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. You may say, I am sinful, very sinful. You may be; but the worse
          you are, the more you need Jesus. He turns no weeping, contrite one away. He does not tell to any all that He
          might reveal, but He bids every trembling soul take courage. Freely will He pardon all who come to Him for
          forgiveness and restoration.... He is today standing at the altar of incense,</p>
      <p>presenting before God the prayers of those who desire His help.</p>
      <p>The souls that turn to Him for refuge, Jesus lifts above the accusing and the strife of tongues. No man or evil
          angel can impeach these souls. Christ unites them to His own <nobr>divine-human</nobr> nature. They stand
          beside the great Sin Bearer, in the light proceeding from the throne of God.</p>
