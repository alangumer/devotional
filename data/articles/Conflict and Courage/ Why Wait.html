    <h1>Why Wait?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Numbers <nobr>13:30-14:10</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. Numbers 13:30.</p>
      <p>It was Caleb’s faith in God that gave him courage; that ... enabled him to stand boldly and unﬂinchingly in
          defense of the right. From the same exalted source, the mighty General of the armies of heaven, every true
          soldier of the cross of Christ must receive strength and courage to overcome obstacles that often seem
          insurmountable.... Those who would do their duty must be ever ready to speak</p>
      <p>the words that God gives them, and not the words of doubt, discouragement, and despair....</p>
      <p>While the doubting ones talk of impossibilities, while they tremble at the thought of high walls and strong
          giants, let the faithful Calebs, who have “another spirit,” come to the front. The truth of God, which
          bringeth salvation, will go forth to the people if ministers and professed believers will not hedge up its
          way, as did the unfaithful spies....</p>
      <p>Human agencies are to be employed in this work. Zeal and energy must be intensiﬁed; talents that are rusting
          from inaction must be pressed into service. The voice that would say, “Wait; do not allow yourself to have
          burdens imposed upon you,” is the voice of the cowardly spies. We want Calebs now who will press to the
          <nobr>front—chieftains</nobr> in Israel who with courageous words will make a strong report in favor of
          immediate action. When the selﬁsh, <nobr>ease-loving,</nobr><nobr>panic-stricken</nobr> people, fearing tall
          giants and inaccessible walls, clamor for retreat, let the voice of the Calebs be heard, even though the
          cowardly ones stand with stones in their hands, ready to beat them down for their faithful testimony.</p>
      <p>It is when the unbelieving cast contempt upon the Word of God that the faithful Calebs are called for. It is
          then that they will stand ﬁrm at the post of duty, without parade, and without swerving because of reproach.
          The unbelieving spies stood ready to destroy Caleb. He saw the stones in the hands of those who had brought a
          false report, but this did not deter him; he had a message, and he would bear it. The same spirit will be
          manifested today by those who are true to God.</p>
