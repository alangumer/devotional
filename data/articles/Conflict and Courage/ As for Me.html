      <p><strong>Joshua 24</strong></p>
      <p>Choose you this day whom ye will serve. Joshua 24:15.</p>
      <p>As Joshua felt the inﬁrmities of age stealing upon him, and realized that his work must soon close, he was
          ﬁlled with anxiety for the future of his people. It was with more than a father’s interest that he addressed
          them, as they gathered once more about their aged chief....</p>
      <p>By Joshua’s direction the ark had been brought from Shiloh. The occasion was one of great solemnity, and this
          symbol of God’s presence would deepen the impression he wished to make upon the people. After presenting the
          goodness of God toward Israel, he called upon them, in the name of Jehovah, to choose whom they would serve.
          The worship of idols was still to some extent secretly practiced, and Joshua endeavored now to bring them to a
          decision that should banish this sin from Israel.... Joshua desired to lead them to serve God, not by
          compulsion, but</p>
      <p>willingly....</p>
      <p>“As for me and my house,” said Joshua, “we will serve Jehovah.” The same holy zeal that inspired the leader’s
          heart was communicated to the people. His appeals called forth the unhesitating response, “God forbid that we
          should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods.” ... Joshua endeavored to lead his hearers to weigh well their
          words, and refrain from vows which they would be unprepared to fulﬁll. With deep earnestness they repeated the
          declaration: “Nay; but we will serve the Lord.” Solemnly consenting to the witness against themselves that
          they had chosen Jehovah, they once more reiterated their pledge of loyalty: “The Lord our God will we serve,
          and his voice will we obey....” Having written an account of</p>
      <p>this solemn transaction, he placed it, with the book of the law, in the side of the ark....</p>
      <p>Joshua’s work for Israel was done. He had “wholly followed the Lord;” and in the book of God he is written,
          “The servant of Jehovah.” The noblest testimony to his character as a public leader is the history of the
          generation that had enjoyed his labors: “Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of
          the elders that overlived Joshua.”</p>
