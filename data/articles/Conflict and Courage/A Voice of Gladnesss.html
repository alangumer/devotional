    <h1>A Voice of Gladness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Philippians 4:4. The great apostle Paul was ﬁrm
          where duty and principle were at stake; but</strong></p>
      <p>courtesy was a marked trait of his character, and this gave him access to the highest class of society. Paul
          never doubted the ability of God or His willingness to give him the grace he needed to live the life of a
          Christian.... He does not live</p>
      <p>under a cloud of doubt, groping his way in the mist and darkness of uncertainty, complaining of hardship and
          trials. A voice of gladness, strong with hope and courage, sounds all along the line down to our time. Paul
          had a healthful religious experience. The love of Christ was his grand theme, and the constraining power that
          governed him.</p>
      <p>When in the most discouraging circumstances, which would have had a depressing inﬂuence upon
          <nobr>half-way</nobr> Christians, he is ﬁrm of heart, full of courage and hope and cheer.... The same hope and
          cheerfulness is seen when he is upon</p>
      <p>the deck of the ship, the tempest beating about him, the ship going to pieces. He gives orders to the commander
          of the ship and preserves the lives of all on board. Although a prisoner, he is really the master of the ship,
          the freest and happiest man on board....</p>
      <p>When before kings and dignitaries of the earth, who held his life in their hands, he quailed not; for he had
          given his life to God, and it was hid in Christ. He softened, by his courtesy, the hearts of these men in
          power, men of ﬁerce temper, wicked and corrupt though they were in heart and life.... Propriety of
          deportment,</p>
      <p>the grace of true politeness, marked all his conduct. When he stretched out his hand, as was his custom in
          speaking, the clanking chains caused him no shame or embarrassment. He looked upon them as tokens of honor,
          and rejoiced that he could suffer for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.... His</p>
      <p>reasoning was so clear and convincing that it made the proﬂigate king tremble....</p>
      <p>Grace, like an angel of mercy, makes his voice heard sweet and clear, repeating the story of the cross, the
          matchless love of Jesus.</p>
