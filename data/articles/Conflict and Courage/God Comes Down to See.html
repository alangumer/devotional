    <h1>God Comes Down to See</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>11:1-9</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make
          a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” Genesis 11:4, R.S.V.</p>
      <p>For a time the descendants of Noah continued to dwell among the mountains where the ark had rested. As their
          numbers increased, apostasy soon led to division. Those who desired to forget their Creator and to cast off
          the restraint of His law felt a constant annoyance from the teaching and example of their
          <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> associates, and after a time they decided to separate from the worshipers of God.
          Accordingly they journeyed to the plain of Shinar, on the banks of the river Euphrates.... Here they decided
          to build a city, and in it a tower</p>
      <p>of such stupendous height as should render it the wonder of the world....</p>
      <p>The dwellers on the plain of Shinar disbelieved God’s covenant that He would not again bring a ﬂood upon the
          earth. Many of them denied the existence of God and attributed the Flood to the operation of natural causes.
          Others believed in a Supreme Being, and that it was He who had destroyed the antediluvian world; and their
          hearts, like that of Cain, rose up in rebellion against Him. One object before them in the erection of the
          tower was to secure their own safety in case of another deluge. By carrying the structure to a much greater
          height than was reached by the waters of the Flood, they thought to place themselves beyond all possibility of
          danger. And as they would be able to ascend to the region of the clouds, they hoped to ascertain the cause of
          the Flood....</p>
      <p>There are tower builders in our time. Inﬁdels construct their theories from the supposed deductions of science,
          and reject the revealed word of God.... In the</p>
      <p>professedly Christian world many turn away from the plain teachings of the Bible and build up a creed from
          human speculations and pleasing fables, and they point to their tower as a way to climb up to heaven....</p>
      <p>The time of God’s investigation is at hand. The Most High will come down to see that which the children of men
          have builded. His sovereign power will be revealed; the works of human pride will be laid low.</p>
