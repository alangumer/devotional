    <h1>Too Many Soldiers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Judges <nobr>7:1-3</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into
          their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. Judges 7:2.</p>
      <p>It had been made a law in Israel that before they went to battle the following proclamation should be made
          throughout the army: “What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and
          return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. And what man is he that hath
          planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in
          the battle, and another man eat of it. And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken
          her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.” And the
          ofﬁcers were to speak further to the people, saying, “What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let
          him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart” (Deuteronomy
          <nobr>20:5-8).</nobr></p>
      <p>Because his numbers were so few compared with those of the enemy, Gideon had refrained from making the usual
          proclamation. He was ﬁlled with astonishment at the declaration that his army was too large. But the Lord saw
          the pride and unbelief existing in the hearts of His people. Aroused by the stirring appeals of Gideon, they
          had readily enlisted; but many were ﬁlled with fear when they saw the multitudes of the Midianites. Yet, had
          Israel triumphed, those very ones would have taken the glory to themselves instead of ascribing the victory to
          God.</p>
      <p>Gideon obeyed the Lord’s direction, and with a heavy heart he saw <nobr>twenty-two</nobr> thousand, or more
          than two thirds of his entire force, depart for their homes.</p>
      <p>The Lord is willing to do great things for us. We shall not gain the victory through numbers, but through the
          full surrender of the soul to Jesus. We are to go forward in His strength, trusting in the mighty God of
          Israel. There is a lesson for us in the story of Gideon’s army.... The Lord is just as willing to</p>
      <p>work through human efforts now, and to accomplish great things through weak instrumentalities.</p>
