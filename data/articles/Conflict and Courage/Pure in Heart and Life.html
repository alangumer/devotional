    <h1>Pure in Heart and Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And every man that hath this hope in him puriﬁeth himself, even as he is pure. 1 John
          3:3.</strong></p>
      <p>John was a teacher of holiness, and in his letters to the church he laid down unerring rules for the conduct of
          Christians.... He taught that the Christian must</p>
      <p>be pure in heart and life. Never should he be satisﬁed with an empty profession. As God is holy in His sphere,
          so fallen man, through faith in Christ, is to be holy in his sphere....</p>
      <p>There are those who profess holiness, who declare that they are wholly the Lord’s, who claim a right to the
          promises of God, while refusing to render obedience to His commandments. These transgressors of the law claim
          everything that is promised to the children of God; but this is presumption on their part, for John tells us
          that true love for God will be revealed in obedience to all His commandments. It is not enough to believe the
          theory of truth, to make a profession of faith in Christ.... “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not
          his</p>
      <p>commandments,” John wrote, “is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” ...</p>
      <p>John did not teach that salvation was to be earned by obedience; but that obedience was the fruit of faith and
          love.... If we abide in Christ, if the love of</p>
      <p>God dwells in the heart, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions, will be in harmony with the will of
          God....</p>
      <p>There are many who, though striving to obey God’s commandments, have little peace or joy. This lack in their
          experience is the result of a failure to exercise faith. They walk as it were in a salt land, a parched
          wilderness. They claim little, when they might claim much; for there is no limit to the promises of God. Such
          ones do not correctly represent the sanctiﬁcation that comes through obedience to the truth. The Lord would
          have all His sons and daughters happy, peaceful, and obedient. Through the exercise of faith the believer
          comes into possession of these blessings. Through faith, every deﬁciency of character may be supplied, every
          deﬁlement cleansed, every fault corrected, every excellence developed.</p>
