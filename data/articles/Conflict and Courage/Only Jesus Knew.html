    <h1>Only Jesus Knew</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>26:14-30;</nobr> John <nobr>13:1-17</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had
          been good for that man if he had not been born. Matthew 26:24.</p>
      <p>The disciples knew nothing of the purpose of Judas. Jesus alone could read his secret. Yet He did not expose
          him. Jesus hungered for his soul.... His heart was</p>
      <p>crying, How can I give thee up? The constraining power of that love was felt by Judas. When the Saviour’s hands
          were bathing those soiled feet, and wiping them with the towel, the heart of Judas thrilled through and
          through with the impulse then and there to confess his sin. But he would not humble himself. He hardened his
          heart against repentance; and the old impulses, for the moment put aside, again controlled him. Judas was now
          offended at Christ’s act in washing the feet of His disciples. If Jesus could so humble Himself, he thought,
          He could not be Israel’s king. All hope of worldly honor in a temporal kingdom was destroyed. Judas was
          satisﬁed that there was nothing to be gained by following Christ.... He was</p>
      <p>possessed by a demon, and he resolved to complete the work he had agreed to do in betraying his Lord.</p>
      <p>Judas the betrayer was present at the sacramental service. He received from Jesus the emblems of His broken
          body and His spilled blood. He heard the words, “This do in remembrance of Me.” And sitting there in the very
          presence of the Lamb of God, the betrayer brooded upon his own dark purposes, and cherished his sullen,
          revengeful thoughts.</p>
      <p>At the Passover supper Jesus proved His divinity by revealing the traitor’s purpose. He tenderly included Judas
          in the ministry to the disciples. But the last appeal of love was unheeded. Then the case of Judas was
          decided, and the feet that Jesus had washed went forth to the betrayer’s work.</p>
      <p>Until this step was taken, Judas had not passed beyond the possibility of repentance. But when he left the
          presence of his Lord and his fellow disciples, the ﬁnal decision had been made. He had passed the boundary
          line.</p>
      <p>How many today are, like Judas, betraying their Lord?</p>
