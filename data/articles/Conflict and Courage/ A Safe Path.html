    <h1>A Safe Path</h1>

      <p><strong>Exodus 14</strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go
          forward. Exodus 14:15.</p>
      <p>God in His providence brought the Hebrews into the mountain fastnesses before the sea, that He might manifest
          His power in their deliverance and signally humble the pride of their oppressors. He might have saved them in
          any other way, but He chose this method in order to test their faith and strengthen their trust in Him. The
          people were weary and terriﬁed, yet if they had held back when Moses bade them advance, God would never have
          opened the path for them. It was “by faith” that “they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land” (Hebrews
          11:29). In marching down to the very water, they showed that they believed the word of God as spoken by Moses.
          They did all that was in their power to do, and then the Mighty One of Israel divided the sea to make a path
          for their feet.</p>
      <p>The great lesson here taught is for all time. Often the Christian life is beset by dangers, and duty seems hard
          to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before and bondage or death behind. Yet the voice of God
          speaks clearly, “Go forward.” We should obey this command, even though our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness,
          and we feel the cold waves about our feet. The obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before
          a halting, doubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every shadow of uncertainty disappears and there
          remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey at all. Unbelief whispers, “Let us wait till the
          obstructions are removed, and we can see our way clearly:” but faith courageously urges an advance, hoping all
          things, believing all things.</p>
      <p>The cloud that was a wall of darkness to the Egyptians was to the Hebrews a great ﬂood of light, illuminating
          the whole camp, and shedding brightness upon the path before them. So the dealings of Providence bring to the
          unbelieving, darkness and despair, while to the trusting soul they are full of light and peace. The path where
          God leads the way may lie through the desert or the sea, but it is a safe path.</p>
