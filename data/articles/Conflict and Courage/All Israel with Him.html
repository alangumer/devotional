    <h1>“All Israel with Him”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>2 Chronicles 12</strong></p>
      <p>It came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
          the Lord, and all Israel with him. 2 Chronicles 12:1.</p>
      <p>The extravagance of Solomon’s reign during his apostasy had led him to tax the people heavily and to require of
          them much menial service.... Had Rehoboam</p>
      <p>and his inexperienced counselors understood the divine will concerning Israel, they would have listened to the
          request of the people for decided reforms in the administration of the government. But in the hour of
          opportunity that came to them during the meeting in Shechem, they failed to reason from cause to
          effect....</p>
      <p>The pen of inspiration has traced the sad record of Solomon’s successor as one who failed to exert a strong
          inﬂuence for loyalty to Jehovah. Naturally headstrong, conﬁdent, <nobr>self-willed,</nobr> and inclined to
          idolatry, nevertheless, had he placed his trust wholly in God, he would have developed strength of character,
          steadfast faith, and submission to the divine requirements. But as time passed, the king put his trust in the
          power of position and in the strongholds he had fortiﬁed. Little by little he gave way to inherited weakness,
          until he threw his inﬂuence wholly on the side of idolatry....</p>
      <p>How sad, how ﬁlled with signiﬁcance, the words, “And all Israel with him”! The people whom God had chosen to
          stand as a light to the surrounding nations were turning from their Source of strength and seeking to become
          like the nations about them. As with Solomon, so with <nobr>Rehoboam—the</nobr> inﬂuence of wrong example led
          many astray. And as with them, so to a greater or less degree is it today with everyone who gives himself up
          to work <nobr>evil—the</nobr> inﬂuence of wrongdoing is not conﬁned to the doer. No man liveth unto himself.
          None perish alone in their iniquity. Every life is a light that brightens and cheers the pathway of others, or
          a dark and desolating inﬂuence that tends toward despair and ruin. We lead others either upward to happiness
          and immortal life, or downward to sorrow and eternal death. And if by our deeds we strengthen or force into
          activity the evil powers of those around us, we share their sin.</p>
