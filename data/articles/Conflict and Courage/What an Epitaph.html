    <h1>What an Epitaph!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings <nobr>11:1-8</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord. 2 Corinthians 6:17.</p>
      <p>Many who started out in life with as fair and promising a morning, in their limited sphere, as Solomon had in
          his exalted station, through one false and irrevocable step in the marriage relation, lose their souls, and
          draw others down to ruin with them. As Solomon’s wives turned his heart away from God to idolatry, so do
          frivolous companions, who have no depth of principle, turn away the hearts of those who were once noble and
          true, to vanity, corrupting pleasures, and downright vice.</p>
      <p>Solomon ﬂattered himself that his wisdom and the power of his example would lead his wives from idolatry to the
          worship of the true God, and also that the alliances thus formed would draw the nations round about into close
          touch with Israel. Vain hope! Solomon’s mistake in regarding himself as strong enough to resist the inﬂuence
          of heathen associates was fatal. And fatal, too, the deception that led him to hope that notwithstanding a
          disregard of God’s law on his part, others might be led to revere and obey its sacred precepts.</p>
      <p>Let the sad memory of Solomon’s apostasy warn every soul to shun the same precipice.... The greatest king that
          ever wielded a scepter, of whom it had</p>
      <p>been said that he was the beloved of God, through misplaced affection became contaminated and was miserably
          forsaken of his God. The mightiest ruler of the earth had failed to rule his own passions. Solomon may have
          been saved “as by ﬁre,” yet his repentance could not efface those high places, nor demolish those stones,
          which remained as evidences of his crimes. He dishonored God, choosing rather to be controlled by lust than to
          be a partaker of the divine nature. What a legacy Solomon’s life has committed to those who would use his
          example to cover their own base actions. We must either transmit a heritage of good or evil. Shall our lives
          and our example be a blessing or a curse? Shall people look at our graves and say, He ruined me, or, He saved
          me?</p>
