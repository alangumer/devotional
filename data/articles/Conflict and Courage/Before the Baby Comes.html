    <h1>Before the Baby Comes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Judges 13</strong></p>
      <p>Teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. Judges 13:8. God Himself appeared to the wife of
          Manoah and told her that she should have a son, and that he should be a great man and should deliver Israel.
          Then He gave</p>
      <p>her special instructions regarding her diet.... Let us regard this as instruction given</p>
      <p>to every mother in our world. If you want your children to have <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> minds, you must be
          temperate yourselves. Keep your own heart and affections sound and healthful, that you may impart to your
          offspring a healthful mind and body.</p>
      <p>Every mother may understand her duty. She may know that the character of her children will depend vastly more
          upon her habits before their birth and her personal efforts after their birth, than upon external advantages
          or disadvantages.... The mother who is a ﬁt teacher for her children must, before</p>
      <p>their birth, form habits of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-control;</nobr> for she transmits to them
          her own qualities, her own strong or weak traits of character.</p>
      <p>Unwise advisers will urge upon the mother the necessity of gratifying every wish and impulse, but such teaching
          is false and mischievous. The mother is by the command of God Himself placed under the most solemn obligation
          to exercise <nobr>self-control.</nobr> And fathers as well as mothers are involved in this responsibility.
          Both parents transmit their own characteristics, mental and physical, their dispositions and appetites, to
          their children.</p>
      <p>Many make the subject of temperance a matter of jest. They claim that the Lord does not concern Himself with
          such minor matters as our eating and drinking. But if the Lord had no care for these things, He would not have
          revealed Himself to the wife of Manoah, giving her deﬁnite instructions, and twice enjoining upon her to
          beware lest she disregard them.</p>
      <p>The effect of prenatal inﬂuences is by many parents looked upon as a matter of little moment; but heaven does
          not so regard it.... In the words spoken to the</p>
      <p>Hebrew mother, God speaks to all mothers in every age.</p>
