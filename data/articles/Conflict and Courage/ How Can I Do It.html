    <h1>How Can I Do It?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>39:7-12</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? Genesis 39:9.</p>
      <p>It is always a critical period in a young man’s life when he is separated from home inﬂuences and wise counsels
          and enters upon new scenes and trying tests. But if he does not of his own accord place himself in these
          positions of danger and remove himself from parental restraint; if, without will or choice of his own, he is
          placed in dangerous positions and relies upon God for <nobr>strength—cherishing</nobr> the love of God in his
          <nobr>heart—he</nobr> will be kept from yielding to temptation by the power of God who placed him in that
          trying position. God will protect him from being corrupted by the ﬁerce temptation. God was with Joseph in his
          new home. He was in the path of duty, suffering wrong but not doing wrong. He therefore had the love and
          protection of God for he carried his religious principle into everything he undertook.</p>
      <p>Joseph’s faith and integrity were to be tested by ﬁery trials. His master’s wife endeavored to entice the young
          man to transgress the law of God. Heretofore he had remained untainted by the corruption teeming in that
          heathen land; but this temptation, so sudden, so strong, so <nobr>seductive—how</nobr> should it be met?
          Joseph knew well what would be the consequence of resistance. On the one hand were concealment, favor, and
          rewards; on the other, disgrace, imprisonment, perhaps death. His whole future life depended upon the decision
          of the moment. Would principle triumph? Would Joseph still be true to God? With inexpressible anxiety, angels
          looked upon the scene.</p>
      <p>Joseph’s answer reveals the power of religious principle. He would not betray the conﬁdence of his master on
          earth, and, whatever the consequences, he would be true to his Master in heaven. Under the inspecting eye of
          God and holy angels many take liberties of which they would not be guilty in the presence of their fellow men,
          but Joseph’s ﬁrst thought was of God. “How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” he said.</p>
      <p>If we were to cherish an habitual impression that God sees and hears all that we do and say and keeps a
          faithful record of our words and actions, and that we must meet it all, we would fear to sin.</p>
