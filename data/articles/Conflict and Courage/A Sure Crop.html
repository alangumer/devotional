    <h1>A Sure Crop</h1>

      <p><strong>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Proverbs 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Samson in his peril had the same source of strength as had Joseph. He could choose the right or the wrong as he
          pleased. But instead of taking hold of the strength of God, he permitted the wild passions of his nature to
          have full sway. The reasoning powers were perverted, the morals corrupted. God had called Samson to a position
          of great responsibility, honor, and usefulness; but he must ﬁrst learn to govern by ﬁrst learning to obey the
          laws of God. Joseph was a free moral agent. Good and evil were before him. He could choose the path of purity,
          holiness, and honor, or the path of immorality and degradation. He chose the right way, and God approved.
          Samson, under similar temptations, which he had brought upon himself, gave loose rein to passion. The path
          which he entered upon he found to end in shame, disaster, and death. What a contrast to the history of
          Joseph!</p>
      <p>The Lord has in His Word plainly instructed His people not to unite themselves with those who have not His love
          and fear before them. Such companions will seldom be satisﬁed with the love and respect which are justly
          theirs. They will constantly seek to gain from the <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> wife or husband some favor which
          shall involve a disregard of the divine requirements. To a godly man, and to the church with which he is
          connected, a worldly wife or a worldly friend is as a spy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to
          betray the servant of Christ, and expose him to the enemy’s attacks.</p>
      <p>The history of Samson conveys a lesson for those whose characters are yet unformed, who have not yet entered
          upon the stage of active life. The youth who enter our schools and colleges will ﬁnd there every class of
          mind. If they desire sport and folly, if they seek to shun the good and unite with the evil, they have the
          opportunity. Sin and righteousness are before them, and they are to choose for themselves. But let them
          remember that “Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.”</p>
