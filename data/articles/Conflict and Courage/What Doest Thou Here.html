    <h1>What Doest Thou Here?</h1>

      <p><strong>1 Kings <nobr>19:8-18</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said
          unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 1 Kings 19:9.</p>
      <p>Elijah’s retreat on Mount Horeb, though hidden from man, was known to God; and the weary and discouraged
          prophet was not left to struggle alone with the powers of darkness that were pressing upon him....</p>
      <p>God met His tried servant with the inquiry, “What doest thou here, Elijah?” I sent you to the brook Cherith and
          afterward to the widow of Sarepta. I commissioned you to return to Israel and to stand before the idolatrous
          priests on Carmel, and I girded you with strength to guide the chariot of the king to the gate of Jezreel. But
          who sent you on this hasty ﬂight into the wilderness? What errand have you here?....</p>
      <p>Much depends on the unceasing activity of those who are true and loyal, and for this reason Satan puts forth
          every possible effort to thwart the divine purpose to be wrought out through the obedient. He causes some to
          lose sight of their high and holy mission, and to become satisﬁed with the pleasures of this life....</p>
      <p>Others he causes to ﬂee in discouragement from duty, because of opposition or persecution.... To every child of
          God whose voice the enemy of souls has</p>
      <p>succeeded in silencing, the question is addressed, “What doest thou here?” I commissioned you to go into all
          the world and preach the gospel, to prepare a people for the day of God. Why are you here? ...</p>
      <p>Of families, as of individuals, the question is asked, “What doest thou here?” In many churches there are
          families well instructed in the truths of God’s word, who might widen the sphere of their inﬂuence by moving
          to places in need of the ministry they are capable of giving. God calls for Christian families to go into the
          dark places of the earth and work wisely and perseveringly for those who are enshrouded in spiritual gloom....
          For the sake of worldly advantage, for the</p>
      <p>sake of acquiring scientiﬁc knowledge, men are willing to venture into pestilential regions and to endure
          hardship and privation. Where are those who are willing to do as much for the sake of telling others of the
          Saviour?</p>
