    <h1>It has to be Personal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke <nobr>8:41-48</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. Matthew 9:21.</p>
      <p>It was a poor woman who spoke these <nobr>words—a</nobr> woman who for twelve years had suffered from a disease
          that made her life a burden. She had spent all her means upon physicians and remedies, only to be pronounced
          incurable. But as she heard of the Great Healer, her hopes revived.... Again and again she had tried</p>
      <p>in vain to get near Him.</p>
      <p>She had begun to despair, when, in making His way through the multitude, He came near where she was.... But
          amid the confusion she could not speak to Him,</p>
      <p>nor catch more than a passing glimpse of His ﬁgure.... As He was passing, she</p>
      <p>reached forward, and succeeded in barely touching the border of His garment. But in that moment she knew that
          she was healed. In that one touch was concentrated the faith of her life, and instantly her pain and
          feebleness gave place to the vigor of perfect health.</p>
      <p>With a grateful heart she then tried to withdraw from the crowd; but suddenly Jesus stopped.... The Saviour
          could distinguish the touch of faith from the</p>
      <p>casual contact of the careless throng. Such trust should not be passed without comment.... Finding concealment
          vain, she came forward tremblingly, and cast</p>
      <p>herself at His feet. With grateful tears she told the story of her suffering, and how she had found relief.
          Jesus gently said, “Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.” He gave no
          opportunity for superstition to claim healing virtue for the mere act of touching His garments. It was not
          through the outward contact with Him, but through the faith which took hold on His divine power, that the cure
          was wrought....</p>
      <p>So in spiritual things. To talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul hunger and living faith,
          avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as the Saviour of the world, can never
          bring healing to the soul.... It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him. The only</p>
      <p>faith that will beneﬁt us is that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to
          ourselves.</p>
