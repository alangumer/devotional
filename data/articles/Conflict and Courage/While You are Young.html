    <h1>While You are Young</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>16:1-5</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Don’t let people look down on you because you are young; see that they look up to you because you are an
          example to them in your speech and behavior, in your love and faith and sincerity. 1 Timothy 4:12,
          Phillips.</p>
      <p>He [Timothy] was a mere lad when chosen by God as a teacher; but so ﬁxed were his principles by a correct
          education that he was ﬁtted for this important position. He bore his responsibilities with Christlike
          meekness. He was faithful, steadfast, and true, and Paul selected him to be his companion in labor and travel.
          Lest Timothy should meet with slights because of his youthfulness, Paul wrote to him, “Let no man despise thy
          youth.” He could safely do this, because Timothy was not <nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr> but continually sought
          guidance.</p>
      <p>There are many youth who move from impulse rather than from judgment. But Timothy inquired at every step, “Is
          this the way of the Lord?” He had no specially brilliant talents, but he consecrated all his abilities to the
          service of God, and this made his work valuable. The Lord found in him a mind that He could mold and fashion
          for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>God will use the youth today as He used Timothy, if they will submit to His guidance. It is your privilege to
          be God’s missionaries. He calls upon you to work for your companions. Seek out those you know to be in danger,
          and in the love of Christ try to help them. How are they to know the Saviour unless they see His virtues in
          His followers?</p>
      <p>The highest aim of our youth should not be to strain after something novel. There was none of this in the mind
          and work of Timothy. They should bear in mind that, in the hands of the enemy of all good, knowledge alone may
          be a power to destroy them. It was a very intellectual being, one who occupied a high position among the
          angelic throng, that ﬁnally became a rebel; and many a mind of superior intellectual attainments is now being
          led captive by his power. The youth should place themselves under the teaching of the Holy Scriptures, and
          weave them into their daily thoughts and practical life. Then they will possess the attributes classed as
          highest in the heavenly courts.</p>
