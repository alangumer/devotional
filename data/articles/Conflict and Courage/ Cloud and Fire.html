    <h1>Cloud and Fire</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exodus <nobr>13:20-23</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He spread a cloud for a covering; and ﬁre to give light in the night. Psalm 105:39.</p>
      <p>“And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of
          ﬁre, to give them light.” ... The standard of their invisible Leader was ever with them. By day the cloud
          directed their journeyings or spread as a canopy above the host. It served as a protection from the burning
          heat, and by its coolness and moisture afforded grateful refreshment in the parched, thirsty desert. By night
          it became a pillar of ﬁre, illuminating their encampment and constantly assuring them of the divine
          presence.</p>
      <p>In one of the most beautiful and comforting passages of Isaiah’s prophecy, reference is made to the pillar of
          cloud and of ﬁre to represent God’s care for His people in the great ﬁnal struggle with the powers of evil:
          “The Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by
          day, and the shining of a ﬂaming ﬁre by night: for above all the glory shall be a covering. And there shall be
          a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm
          and from rain” (Isaiah 4:5, 6, margin).</p>
      <p>In the time of trial before us God’s pledge of security will be placed upon those who have kept the word of His
          patience. Christ will say to His faithful ones: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
          doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast” (Isaiah
          26:20). The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obedient
          and faithful. The pillar of cloud which speaks wrath and terror to the transgressor of God’s law is light and
          mercy and deliverance to those who have kept His commandments. The arm strong to smite the rebellious will be
          strong to deliver the loyal. Every faithful one will surely be gathered. “He shall send his angels with a
          great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
          to the other” (Matthew 24:31).</p>
