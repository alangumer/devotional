    <h1>On Enemy Ground</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>26:31-35;</nobr> Matthew 26:56; Matthew 26:58; Matthew <nobr>26:69-75</nobr> Wherefore
          let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 1</strong></p>
      <p>Corinthians 10:12.</p>
      <p>When Christ on the eve of His betrayal forewarned His disciples, “All ye shall be offended because of me this
          night,” Peter conﬁdently declared, “Although all shall be offended, yet will not I” (Mark 14:27, 29). Peter
          did not know his own danger. <nobr>Self-conﬁdence</nobr> misled him. He thought himself able to withstand
          temptation; but in a few short hours the test came, and with cursing and swearing he denied his Lord.</p>
      <p>Peter had not designed that his real character should be known. In assuming an air of indifference he had
          placed himself on the enemy’s ground, and he became an easy prey to temptation. If he had been called to ﬁght
          for his Master, he would have been a courageous soldier; but when the ﬁnger of scorn was pointed at him, he
          proved himself a coward. Many who do not shrink from active warfare for their Lord are driven by ridicule to
          deny their faith. By associating with those whom they should avoid, they place themselves in the way of
          temptation. They invite the enemy to tempt them, and are led to say and do that of which under other
          circumstances they would never have been guilty. The disciple of Christ who in our day disguises his faith
          through dread of suffering or reproach denies his Lord as really as did Peter in the judgment hall.</p>
      <p>When the crowing of the cock reminded him of the words of Christ, surprised and shocked at what he had just
          done he turned and looked at his Master. At that moment Christ looked at Peter, and beneath that grieved look,
          in which compassion and love for him were blended, Peter understood himself. He went out and wept bitterly.
          That look of Christ’s broke his heart. Peter had come to the turning point, and bitterly did he repent his
          sin.... Now his <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> was</p>
      <p>gone. Never again were the old boastful assertions repeated....</p>
      <p>It was through <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> that Peter fell; and it was through repentance and humiliation that
          his feet were again established. In the record of his experience every repenting sinner may ﬁnd
          encouragement.</p>
