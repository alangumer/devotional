    <h1>A Straight Message</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Luke 1:80; Matthew <nobr>3:1-6</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. Amos 4:12, last part.</p>
      <p>John the Baptist in his desert life was taught of God. He studied the revelations of God in nature. Under the
          guiding of the divine Spirit, he studied the scrolls of the prophets. By day and by night, Christ was his
          study, his meditation, until mind and heart and soul were ﬁlled with the glorious vision. He looked upon the
          King in His beauty, and self was lost sight of. He beheld the majesty of holiness, and knew himself to be
          inefﬁcient and unworthy. It was God’s message that he was to declare. It was in God’s power and His
          righteousness that he was to stand. He was ready to go forth as Heaven’s messenger, unawed by the human,
          because he had looked upon the Divine....</p>
      <p>With no elaborate arguments or <nobr>ﬁne-spun</nobr> theories did John declare his message. Startling and
          stern, yet full of hope, his voice was heard from the wilderness, “Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at
          hand.” ... Unlearned peasants and ﬁshermen from the surrounding country; the Roman soldiers from the barracks
          of Herod; chieftains with their swords at their sides, ready to put down anything that might savor of
          rebellion; the avaricious <nobr>tax-gatherers</nobr> from their <nobr>toll-booths;</nobr> and from the
          Sanhedrim the phylactered <nobr>priests,—all</nobr> listened as if spellbound; and all ... went away ... cut
          to the heart with a sense of their sins....</p>
      <p>In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John is
          to be done. God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord.... As a people
          who believe in</p>
      <p>Christ’s soon coming, we have a message to <nobr>bear,—“prepare</nobr> to meet thy God.” Our message must be as
          direct as was the message of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. Notwithstanding that his life was
          imperiled, he did not hesitate to declare God’s word. And our work in this age must be done as
          faithfully.</p>
      <p>In order to give such a message as John gave, we must have a spiritual experience like his. The same work must
          be wrought in us. We must behold God, and in beholding Him, lose sight of self.</p>
