    <h1>Haven’t I Sent You?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Judges <nobr>6:1-23</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might ... : have not I sent thee? Judges 6:14.</p>
      <p>To Gideon came the divine call to deliver his people. He was engaged at the time in threshing wheat. A small
          quantity of grain had been concealed, and not daring to beat it out on the ordinary threshing ﬂoor, he had
          resorted to a spot near the winepress; for the season of ripe grapes being still far off, little notice was
          now taken of the vineyards. As Gideon labored in secrecy and silence, he sadly pondered upon the condition of
          Israel and considered how the oppressor’s yoke might be broken from off his people.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the “Angel of the Lord” appeared and addressed him with the words,“Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty
          man of valor.”</p>
      <p>“O my Lord,” was his answer, “if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
          miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord hath
          forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.”</p>
      <p>The Messenger of heaven replied, “Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the
          Midianites: have not I sent thee?”</p>
      <p>Gideon deeply felt his own insufﬁciency for the great work before him.... The</p>
      <p>Lord does not always choose for His work men of the greatest talents, but He selects those whom He can best
          use. Individuals who might do good service for God, may for a time be left in obscurity, apparently unnoticed
          and unemployed by their Master. But if they faithfully perform the duties of their humble position, cherishing
          a willingness to labor and to sacriﬁce for Him, He will in His own time intrust them with greater
          responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Before honor is humility. The Lord can use most effectually those who are most sensible of their own
          unworthiness and inefﬁciency. He will teach them to exercise the courage of faith. He will make them strong by
          uniting their weakness to His might, wise by connecting their ignorance with His wisdom.</p>
