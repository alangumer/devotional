      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>12:1-9</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance,
          obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. Hebrews 11:8.</p>
      <p>Abraham had grown up in the midst of superstition and heathenism. Even his father’s household, by whom the
          knowledge of God had been preserved, were yielding to the seductive inﬂuences surrounding them, and they
          “served other gods” than Jehovah....</p>
      <p>The message of God came to Abraham, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s
          house, unto a land that I will show thee.” In order that God might qualify him for his great work as the
          keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be separated from the associations of his early life....</p>
      <p>Abraham’s unquestioning obedience is one of the most striking evidences of faith to be found in all the
          Bible....</p>
      <p>It was no light test that was thus brought upon Abraham, no small sacriﬁce that was required of him. There were
          strong ties to bind him to his country, his kindred, and his home. But he did not hesitate to obey the call.
          He had no question to ask concerning the land of <nobr>promise—whether</nobr> the soil was fertile and the
          climate healthful; whether the country afforded agreeable surroundings and would afford opportunities for
          amassing wealth. God had spoken, and His servant must obey; the happiest place on earth for him was the place
          where God would have him to be.</p>
      <p>Many are still tested as was Abraham.... They may be required to abandon</p>
      <p>a career that promises wealth and honor, to leave congenial and proﬁtable associations, and separate from
          kindred, to enter upon what appears to be only a path of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> hardship, and sacriﬁce. God
          has a work for them to do....</p>
      <p>Who is ready at the call of Providence to renounce cherished plans and familiar associations? Who will accept
          new duties and enter untried ﬁelds ...? He who will do this has the faith of Abraham, and will share with him
          that “far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,” with which “the sufferings of this present time are not
          worthy to be compared” (2 Corinthians 4:17; Romans 8:18).</p>
