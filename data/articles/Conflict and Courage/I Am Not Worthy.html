    <h1>“I Am Not Worthy”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Matthew <nobr>8:5-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. Matthew 8:10.</p>
      <p>The centurion did not question the Saviour’s power.... He had not seen the</p>
      <p>Saviour, but the reports he heard had inspired him with faith.... In the teaching of</p>
      <p>Christ, as it had been reported to him, he found that which met the need of the soul. All that was spiritual
          within him responded to the Saviour’s words. But he felt unworthy to come into the presence of Jesus, and he
          appealed to the Jewish elders to make request for the healing of his servant.</p>
      <p>On the way to the centurion’s home, Jesus receives a message from the ofﬁcer himself, “Lord, trouble not
          thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.” Still the Saviour keeps on His way, and
          the centurion comes in person to complete the message, saying, “Neither thought I myself worthy to come unto
          thee,” “but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having
          soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
          servant, Do this, and he doeth it.” ...</p>
      <p>“As thou hast believed,” Christ said, “so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame
          hour.”</p>
      <p>The Jewish elders had commended the centurion to Christ because of the favor he had shown to “our nation.” He
          is worthy, they said, for “he hath built us a synagogue.” But the centurion said of himself, “I am not
          worthy.”</p>
      <p>His heart had been touched by the grace of Christ. He saw his own unworthiness; yet he feared not to ask help.
          He trusted not to his own goodness; his argument was his great need. His faith took hold upon Christ in His
          true character. He did not believe in Him merely as a worker of miracles, but as the friend and Saviour of
          mankind.</p>
      <p>It is thus that every sinner may come to Christ.... Renouncing all</p>
      <p><nobr>self-dependence,</nobr> we may look to the cross of Calvary and say,—</p>
      <p>“In my hand no price I bring; Simply to Thy cross I cling.”</p>
