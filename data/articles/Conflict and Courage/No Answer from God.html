    <h1>No Answer from God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>28:3-25</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 1 Samuel 28:6.</p>
      <p>The Lord never turned away a soul that came to Him in sincerity and humility. Why did he turn Saul away
          unanswered? The king had by his own act forfeited the beneﬁts of all the methods of inquiring of God. He had
          rejected the counsel of Samuel the prophet; he had exiled David, the chosen of God; he had slain the priests
          of the Lord.... He had sinned away the Spirit of grace, and could he be</p>
      <p>answered by dreams and revelations from the Lord? Saul did not turn to God with humility and repentance. It was
          not pardon for sin and reconciliation with God, that he sought, but deliverance from his foes. By his own
          stubbornness and rebellion he had cut himself off from God. There could be no return but by the way of
          penitence and contrition; but the proud monarch, in his anguish and despair, determined to seek help from
          another source.... It was told the king that a</p>
      <p>woman who had a familiar spirit was living in concealment at Endor.... Disguising</p>
      <p>himself, Saul went forth by night with but two attendants, to seek the retreat of the sorceress....</p>
      <p>What bondage so terrible as that of him who is given over to the control of the worst of
          <nobr>tyrants—himself!</nobr> Trust in God and obedience to His will were the only conditions upon which Saul
          could be king of Israel. Had he complied with these conditions throughout his reign, his kingdom would have
          been secure; God would have been his guide, the Omnipotent his shield. God had borne long with Saul; and
          although his rebellion and obstinacy had <nobr>well-nigh</nobr> silenced the divine voice in the soul, there
          was still opportunity for repentance. But when in his peril he turned from God to obtain light from a
          confederate of Satan, he had cut the last tie that bound him to his Maker....</p>
      <p>By consulting that spirit of darkness Saul had destroyed himself. Oppressed by the horror of despair, it would
          be impossible for him to inspire his army with courage. Separated from the Source of strength, he could not
          lead the minds of Israel to look to God as their helper. Thus the prediction of evil would work its own
          accomplishment.</p>
