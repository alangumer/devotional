      <p><strong>1 Samuel 3</strong></p>
      <p>And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. 1 Samuel 3:1. Young as he was when brought to
          minister in the tabernacle, Samuel had even then duties to perform in the service of God, according to his
          capacity. These were at ﬁrst very humble, and not always pleasant; but they were performed to the</p>
      <p>best of his ability, and with a willing heart....</p>
      <p>If children were taught to regard the humble round of everyday duties as the course marked out for them by the
          Lord, as a school in which they were to be trained to render faithful and efﬁcient service, how much more
          pleasant and honorable would their work appear. To perform every duty as unto the Lord, throws a charm around
          the humblest employment and links the workers on earth with the holy beings who do God’s will in heaven.</p>
      <p>The life of Samuel from early childhood had been a life of piety and devotion. He had been placed under the
          care of Eli in his youth, and the loveliness of his character drew forth the warm affection of the aged
          priest. He was kind, generous, diligent, obedient, and respectful. The contrast between the course of the
          youth Samuel and that of the priest’s own sons was very marked, and Eli found rest and comfort and blessing in
          the presence of his charge. It was a singular thing that between Eli, the chief magistrate of the nation, and
          the simple child so warm a friendship should exist. Samuel was helpful and affectionate, and no father ever
          loved his child more tenderly than did Eli this youth. As the inﬁrmities of age came upon Eli, he felt more
          keenly the disheartening, reckless, proﬂigate course of his own sons, and he turned to Samuel for comfort and
          support.</p>
      <p>How touching to see youth and old age relying one upon the other, the youth looking up to the aged for counsel
          and wisdom, the aged looking to the youth for help and sympathy. This is as it should be. God would have the
          young possess such qualiﬁcations of character that they shall ﬁnd delight in the friendship of the old, that
          they may be united in the endearing bonds of affection to those who are approaching the borders of the
          grave.</p>
