    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acts <nobr>19:1-20</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts
          brought their books together, and burned them before all men. Acts 19:18, 19.</p>
      <p>By burning their books on magic, the Ephesian converts showed that the things in which they had once delighted
          they now abhorred. It was by and through magic that they had especially offended God and imperiled their
          souls; and it was against magic that they showed such indignation.... By retaining these books the
          disciples</p>
      <p>would have exposed themselves to temptation; by selling them they would have placed temptation in the way of
          others. They had renounced the kingdom of darkness, and to destroy its power they did not hesitate at any
          sacriﬁce. Thus truth triumphed over men’s prejudices and their love of money.... The inﬂuence of what</p>
      <p>had taken place was more widespread than even Paul realized. From Ephesus the news was widely circulated, and a
          strong impetus was given to the cause of Christ. Long after the apostle himself had ﬁnished his course, these
          scenes lived in the memory of men and were the means of winning converts to the gospel.</p>
      <p>It is fondly supposed that heathen superstitions have disappeared before the civilization of the twentieth
          century. But the word of God and the stern testimony of facts declare that sorcery is practiced in this age as
          verily as in the days of the <nobr>old-time</nobr> magicians. The ancient system of magic is, in reality, the
          same as what is now known as modern spiritualism. Satan is ﬁnding access to thousands of minds by presenting
          himself under the guise of departed friends....</p>
      <p>The magicians of heathen times have their counterpart in the spiritualistic mediums, the clairvoyants, and the
          fortunetellers of today.... Could the veil be</p>
      <p>lifted from before our eyes, we should see evil angels employing all their arts to deceive and to destroy.
          Wherever an inﬂuence is exerted to cause men to forget God, there Satan is exercising his bewitching power....
          The apostle’s admonition</p>
      <p>to the Ephesian church should be heeded by the people of God today: “Have no fellowship with the unfruitful
          works of darkness, but rather reprove them.”</p>
