    <h1>She Kept Her Promise</h1>

      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>1:1-18</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life. 1 Samuel 1:11. Elkanah, a Levite of Mount Ephraim, was
          a man of wealth and inﬂuence, and</p>
      <p>one who loved and feared the Lord. His wife, Hannah, was a woman of fervent piety. Gentle and unassuming, her
          character was marked with deep earnestness and a lofty faith.</p>
      <p>The blessing so earnestly sought by every Hebrew was denied this godly pair; their home was not gladdened by
          the voice of childhood; and the desire to perpetuate his name led the <nobr>husband—as</nobr> it had led many
          <nobr>others—to</nobr> contract a second marriage. But this step, prompted by a lack of faith in God, did not
          bring happiness. Sons and daughters were added to the household; but the joy and beauty of God’s sacred
          institution had been marred and the peace of the family was broken. Peninnah, the new wife, was jealous and
          <nobr>narrow-minded,</nobr> and she bore herself with pride and insolence. To Hannah, hope seemed crushed and
          life a weary burden; yet she met the trial with uncomplaining meekness....</p>
      <p>The burden which she could share with no earthly friend she cast upon God. Earnestly she pleaded that He would
          take away her reproach and grant her the precious gift of a son to nurture and train for Him. And she made a
          solemn vow that if her request were granted, she would dedicate her child to God, even from its birth....</p>
      <p>Hannah’s prayer was granted; she received the gift for which she had so earnestly entreated. As she looked upon
          the child, she called him <nobr>Samuel—“asked</nobr> of God.”</p>
      <p>As soon as the little one was old enough to be separated from its mother, she fulﬁlled her solemn vow. She
          loved her child with all the devotion of a mother’s heart; day by day her affections entwined about him more
          closely as she watched his expanding powers, and listened to the childish prattle; he was her only son, the
          especial gift of heaven; but she had received him as a treasure consecrated to God, and she would not withhold
          from the Giver His own. Faith strengthened the mother’s heart, and she yielded not to the pleadings of natural
          affection.</p>
