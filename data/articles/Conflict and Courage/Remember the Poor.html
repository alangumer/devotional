    <h1>Remember the Poor</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Nehemiah <nobr>5:1-13</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy
          God giveth thee, ... thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufﬁcient for his
          need. Deuteronomy 15:7, 8.</p>
      <p>At times following the return of the exiles from Babylon, the wealthy Jews had gone directly contrary to these
          commands. When the poor were obliged to borrow to pay tribute to the king, the wealthy had lent them money,
          but had exacted a high rate of interest. By taking mortgages on the lands of the poor, they had gradually
          reduced the unfortunate debtors to the deepest poverty. Many had been forced to sell their sons and daughters
          into servitude; and there seemed no hope of improving their condition, no way to redeem either their children
          or their lands, no prospect before them but <nobr>ever-increasing</nobr> distress, with perpetual want and
          bondage. Yet they were of the same nation, children of the same covenant, as their more favored
          brethren....</p>
      <p>As Nehemiah heard of this cruel oppression, his soul was ﬁlled with indignation.... He saw that if he succeeded
          in breaking up the oppressive custom</p>
      <p>of exaction he must take a decided stand for justice. With characteristic energy and determination he went to
          work to bring relief to his brethren.</p>
      <p>The fact that the oppressors were men of wealth, whose support was greatly needed in the work of restoring the
          city, did not for a moment inﬂuence Nehemiah. He sharply rebuked the nobles and rulers, and when he had
          gathered a great assembly of the people he set before them the requirements of God touching the case....</p>
      <p>This record teaches an important lesson. “The love of money is the root of all evil” (1 Timothy 6:10). In this
          generation the desire for gain is the absorbing passion.... We were all debtors to divine justice, but we had
          nothing with which</p>
      <p>to pay the debt. Then the Son of God, who pitied us, paid the price of our redemption. He became poor that
          through His poverty we might be rich. By deeds of liberality toward His poor we may prove the sincerity of our
          gratitude for the mercy extended to us.</p>
