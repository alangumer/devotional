    <h1>A Dangerous Example</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>1 Samuel <nobr>2:22-36</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>They hearkened not unto the voice of their father. 1 Samuel 2:25.</p>
      <p>Eli was priest and judge in Israel. He held the highest and most responsible positions among the people of God.
          As a man divinely chosen for the sacred duties of the priesthood, and set over the land as the highest
          judicial authority, he was looked up to as an example, and he wielded a great inﬂuence over the tribes of
          Israel. But although he had been appointed to govern the people, he did not rule his own household.... Loving
          peace and ease, he did not exercise</p>
      <p>his authority to correct the evil habits and passions of his children. Rather than contend with them or punish
          them, he would submit to their will and give them their own way. Instead of regarding the education of his
          sons as one of the most important of his responsibilities, he treated the matter as of little consequence. The
          priest and judge of Israel had not been left in darkness as to the duty of restraining and governing the
          children that God had given to his care. But Eli shrank from this duty, because it involved crossing the will
          of his sons, and would make it necessary to punish and deny them....</p>
      <p>The curse of transgression was apparent in the corruption and evil that marked the course of his sons. They had
          no proper appreciation of the character of God or of the sacredness of His law. His service was to them a
          common thing. From childhood they had been accustomed to the sanctuary and its service; but instead of
          becoming more reverent, they had lost all sense of its holiness and signiﬁcance. The father had not corrected
          their want of reverence for his authority, had not checked their disrespect for the solemn services of the
          sanctuary; and when they reached manhood, they were full of the deadly fruits of skepticism and
          rebellion....</p>
      <p>There is no greater curse upon households than to allow the youth to have their own way. When parents regard
          every wish of their children and indulge them in what they know is not for their good, the children soon lose
          all respect for their parents, all regard for the authority of God or man, and are led captive at the will of
          Satan.</p>
