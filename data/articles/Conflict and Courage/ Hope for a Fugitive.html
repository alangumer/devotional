    <h1>Hope for a Fugitive</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Genesis <nobr>27:41-28:15</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the
          angels of God ascending and descending on it. Genesis 28:12.</p>
      <p>Threatened with death by the wrath of Esau, Jacob went out from his father’s home a fugitive; but he carried
          with him the father’s blessing; Isaac had renewed to him the covenant promise, and had bidden him, as its
          inheritor, to seek a wife of his mother’s family in Mesopotamia. Yet it was with a deeply troubled heart that
          Jacob set out on his lonely journey. With only his staff in his hand he must travel hundreds of miles through
          a country inhabited by wild, roving tribes. In his remorse and timidity he sought to avoid men, lest he should
          be traced by his angry brother. He feared that he had lost forever the blessing that God had purposed to give
          him; and Satan was at hand to press temptations upon him....</p>
      <p>The darkness of despair pressed upon his soul, and he hardly dared to pray. But he was so utterly lonely that
          he felt the need of protection from God as he had never felt it before. With weeping and deep humiliation he
          confessed his sin, and entreated for some evidence that he was not utterly forsaken.... God did not</p>
      <p>forsake Jacob. His mercy was still extended to His erring, distrustful servant. The Lord compassionately
          revealed just what Jacob <nobr>needed—a</nobr> Saviour....</p>
      <p>Wearied with his journey, the wanderer lay down upon the ground, with a stone for his pillow. As he slept he
          beheld a ladder, bright and shining, whose base rested upon the earth, while the top reached to heaven. Upon
          this ladder angels were ascending and descending; above it was the Lord of glory....</p>
      <p>Jacob awoke from his sleep in the deep stillness of night. The shining forms of his vision had disappeared.
          Only the dim outline of the lonely hills, and above them the heavens bright with stars, now met his gaze. But
          he had a solemn sense that God was with him. An unseen presence ﬁlled the solitude. “Surely the Lord is in
          this place,” he said, “and I knew it not.... This is none other but the house of</p>
      <p>God, and this is the gate of heaven.”</p>
