    <h1>Provision for Every Emergency</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the ﬁrst began to be spoken by the
          Lord, and was conﬁrmed unto us by them that heard him. Hebrews 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The divine Author of salvation left nothing incomplete in the plan; every phase of it is perfect. The sin of
          the whole world was laid upon Jesus, and divinity gave its highest value to the suffering of humanity in Jesus
          that the whole world might be pardoned through faith in the Substitute. The most guilty need have no fear but
          that God will pardon, for because of the efﬁcacy of the divine sacriﬁce the penalty of the law will be
          remitted. Through Christ the sinner may return to allegiance to God.</p>
      <p>How wonderful is the plan of redemption in its simplicity and fullness. It not only provides for the full
          pardon of the sinner but also for the restoration of the transgressor, making a way whereby he may be accepted
          as a son of God. Through obedience he may be the possessor of love and peace and joy. His faith may unite him
          in his weakness to Christ, the source of divine strength, and through the merits of Christ he may ﬁnd the
          approval of God, because Christ has satisﬁed the demands of the law, and He imputes His righteousness to the
          penitent, believing soul....</p>
      <p>What love, what wonderful love, was displayed by the Son of God. ... Christ takes the sinner from the lowest
          degradation, and puriﬁes, reﬁnes, and ennobles him. By beholding Jesus as He is, the sinner is transformed and
          elevated to the very summit of dignity, even to a seat with Christ upon his throne....</p>
      <p>The plan of redemption provides for every emergency and for every want of the soul. If it were deﬁcient in any
          way, the sinner might ﬁnd some excuse to plead for neglect of its terms, but the inﬁnite God had a knowledge
          of every human necessity, and ample provision has been made to supply every need.... What, then, can the
          sinner</p>
      <p>say in the great day of ﬁnal judgment as to why he refused to give attention, the most thorough and earnest, to
          the salvation proffered him?<span class="ft15">41</span></p>
