    <h1>One Family in Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in
          heaven and earth is named. Ephesians 3:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>Through faith in Christ we become members of the royal family, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.
          In Christ we are one. As we come in sight of Calvary, and view the royal Sufferer who in man’s nature bore the
          curse of the law in his behalf, all national distinctions, all sectarian differences, are obliterated; all
          honor of rank, all pride of caste is lost. The light shining from the throne of God upon the cross of Calvary
          forever puts an end to <nobr>man-made</nobr> separations between class and race. Men of every class become
          members of one family, children of the heavenly King, not through earthly power, but through the love of God
          who gave Jesus to a life of poverty, afﬂiction, and humiliation, to a death of shame and agony, that He might
          bring many sons and daughters unto glory.</p>
      <p>It is not the position, not the ﬁnite wisdom, not the qualiﬁcations, not the endowments of any person that
          makes him rank high in the esteem of God. The intellect, the reason, the talents of men, are the gifts of God
          to be employed to His glory, for the upbuilding of His eternal kingdom. It is the spiritual and moral
          character that is of value in the sight of Heaven, and that will survive the grave....</p>
      <p>All who are found worthy to be counted as the members of the family of God in heaven, will recognize one
          another as sons and daughters of God. They will realize that they all receive their strength and pardon from
          the same source, even from Jesus Christ who was cruciﬁed for their sins. They know that they are to wash their
          robes of character in His blood, to ﬁnd acceptance with the Father in His name, if they would be in the bright
          assembly of the saints, clothed in the white robes of righteousness.<span class="ft17">10</span></p>
      <p>The family is named after the Father. Those who enter the heavenly mansions will have the name of the Father
          and the name of the city of God written in their foreheads. They will bear the divine superscription and be
          partakers of the divine nature.<span class="ft11">11</span></p>
