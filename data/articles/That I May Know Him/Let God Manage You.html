    <h1>Let God Manage You</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us. Psalm 90:17.</strong></p>
      <p>God wants you to let Him manage you, that you may be a lovable Christian. The Lord would have the natural and
          hereditary traits of character come under the pruning knife. Look steadfastly unto Jesus, that you may catch
          His spirit and cherish the qualities of Christlike character. Then it will be recognized by all who have any
          connection with you, that you have learned of Christ His meekness, His affection, His tenderness, His
          sympathy. Never rest satisﬁed until you possess a loving and lovable spirit. Your words may come from the good
          treasure of the heart to strengthen, help, bless, and win all around you.... Others catch your spirit. The
          seeds we</p>
      <p>sow will bear a harvest in goodness, patience, kindness, and love, or exactly the opposite....</p>
      <p>Many, many need melting over. Be sound in principle, true to God, but do not manifest one stern, ungenial phase
          of character. God does not want you to incur contempt by manifesting a disposition like a ball of putty, but
          He does want you to be in principle as sound as a rock, yet with a healthful mellowness. Like the Master, be
          full of grace and truth. Jesus was incorruptible, undeﬁled, yet in His life were mingled gentleness, meekness,
          benignity, sympathy, and love. The poorest were not afraid to approach Him; they did not fear a rebuff. What
          Christ was, every Christian should strive to be. In holiness and winsomeness of character He is our
          model....</p>
      <p>We should all learn of Christ what it means to be a Christian. Let us learn of Him how to combine ﬁrmness,
          justice, purity, and integrity with unselﬁsh courtesy and kindly sympathy. Thus the character becomes lovable
          and attractive. The beauty of holiness will disarm scoffers....</p>
      <p>The heart must receive the divine current, and let it ﬂow out in rich streams of mercy and grace to other
          hearts. All who would win souls to Christ must be winsome.<span class="ft15">48</span></p>
