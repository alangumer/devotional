      <p><strong>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of
          me. John 5:39.</strong></p>
      <p>The admonition to “search the Scriptures” was never more appropriate than at the present time. This is an age
          of unrest, and the youth drink deeply of its spirit. Would that they could be made to realize the importance
          and the peril of the position they occupy! ... Never were such momentous issues before any generation as await
          the one now coming upon the stage of action. Never were the youth of any age or country so earnestly observed
          by the angels of God as are the youth of today. All heaven is watching with intense interest for every
          indication of the characters they are <nobr>forming—whether</nobr> when brought to the test they will stand
          ﬁrmly for God and the right, or be swayed by worldly inﬂuences....</p>
      <p>God has a great work to be done in a short time. He has committed to the young, talents of intellect, time, and
          means, and He holds them responsible for the use they make of these good gifts. He calls upon them to come to
          the front, to resist the corrupting, bewitching inﬂuences of this fast age and to become qualiﬁed to labor in
          His cause. They cannot become ﬁtted for usefulness without putting heart and energy into the work of
          preparation....</p>
      <p>It is a divine law that blessings come at some cost to the receiver. Those who would become wise in the
          sciences must study, and those who would become wise in regard to Bible truth, that they may impart that
          knowledge to others, must be diligent students of God’s Holy Word. There is no other way; they must search the
          Scriptures diligently, interestedly, prayerfully.... And after all their research, there is beyond an inﬁnity
          of</p>
      <p>wisdom, love, and power.</p>
      <p>The Bible should ever be the Christian’s textbook. Of all books it should be made the most attractive to the
          young. If they drink deep of its spirit they will be prepared to withstand the wiles of Satan and to resist
          the temptations of this inﬁdel age.<span class="ft11">10</span></p>
