    <h1>The Revelation of Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the
          marriage: and the door was shut. Matthew 25:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Let none follow the example of the foolish virgins and think that it will be safe to wait until the crisis
          comes before gaining a preparation of character to stand in that time. It will be too late to seek for the
          righteousness of Christ when the guests are called in and examined. Now is the time to put on the
          righteousness of <nobr>Christ—the</nobr> wedding garment that will ﬁt you to enter into the marriage supper of
          the Lamb. In the parable, the foolish virgins are represented as begging for oil and failing to receive it at
          their request. This is symbolic of those who have not prepared themselves by developing a character to stand
          in a time of crisis. It is as if they should go to their neighbors and say, Give me your character or I shall
          be lost. Those that were wise could not impart their oil to the ﬂickering lamps of the foolish virgins.
          Character is not transferable. It is not to be bought or sold; it is to be acquired. The Lord has given to
          every individual an opportunity to obtain a righteous character ..., but He has not provided a way by which
          one human agent may impart to another the character which he has developed....</p>
      <p>The day is coming, and it is close upon us, when every phase of character will be revealed by special
          temptation. Those who remain true to principle, who exercise faith to the end, will be those who have proved
          true under test and trial during the previous hours of their probation, and have formed characters after the
          likeness of Christ. It will be those who have cultivated close acquaintance with Christ who, through His
          wisdom and grace, are partakers of the divine nature. But no human being can give to another, heart devotion
          and noble qualities of mind, and supply his deﬁciencies with moral power.<span class="ft17">11</span></p>
      <p>Let no one put off the day of preparation, lest the call be made, “Go forth to meet the bridegroom,” and you be
          found as were the foolish virgins, with no oil in your vessels with your lamps.<span
