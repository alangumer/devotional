    <h1>In the Master’s Stead</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 1 Corinthians 4:2.</strong></p>
      <p>A steward identiﬁes himself with his master. His master’s interests become his. He has accepted the
          responsibilities of a steward and he must act in the master’s stead, doing as the master would do if he were
          presiding over his own goods. The position is one of dignity, in that his master trusts him. If a steward in
          any wise acts selﬁshly and turns the advantages gained in trading with his lord’s goods to his own advantage,
          he has perverted the trust reposed in him. The master can no longer look upon him as a servant to be trusted,
          one on whom he can depend.</p>
      <p>Every Christian is a steward of God, entrusted with His goods.... Let all who claim to be Christians deal</p>
      <p>wisely with the Lord’s goods. God is making an inventory of the money lent you and the spiritual advantages
          given you. Will you as stewards make careful inventory? Will you examine whether you are using economically
          all that God has placed in your charge, or whether you are wasting the Lord’s goods by selﬁsh outlay in order
          to make a display? Would that all that is spent needlessly were laid up as treasure in heaven!<span
          class="ft17">2</span></p>
      <p>However large the income or the possessions of any person, any family, or any institution, let all remember
          that they are only stewards, holding in trust the Lord’s money. All proﬁt, all pay, our time, our talents, our
          opportunities, are to be accounted for to Him who gives them all....</p>
      <p>God will encourage His faithful stewards who are ready to put all their energies and <nobr>God-given</nobr>
          endowments to the very best use. As all learn the lesson of faithfully rendering to God what is His due, He
          through His providence will enable some to bring princely offerings. He will enable others to make smaller
          offerings, and the small and the large gifts are acceptable to Him if given with an eye single to His
          glory.<span class="ft17">3</span></p>
