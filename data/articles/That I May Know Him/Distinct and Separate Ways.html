    <h1>Distinct and Separate Ways</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
          destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
          leadeth unto life, and few there be that ﬁnd it. Matthew 7:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>These roads are distinct, separate, extending in opposite directions. One leads to eternal death, the other to
          eternal life. One is broad and smooth, the other narrow and rugged. So the parties that travel them are
          opposite in character, in life, in dress, and in conversation. Those who travel in the narrow way are talking
          of the happiness they will have at the end of the journey.... They do not dress like the company in the broad
          road, nor talk like</p>
      <p>them, nor act like them. A pattern has been given them. A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief opened that
          road for them and traveled it Himself. His followers see His footprints and are comforted and cheered. He went
          through safely; so can they, if they follow in His steps.</p>
      <p>In the broad road all are occupied with their persons, their dress, and the pleasures in the way. They indulge
          freely in mirth and revelry, and think not of their journey’s end, of the certain ruin at the termination of
          the path. Every day they approach nearer their destruction, yet they madly rush on faster and faster.... When
          it is too late</p>
      <p>they see that they have gained nothing substantial. They have grasped at shadows and lost eternal life....</p>
      <p>A form of godliness will not save any. All must have a deep and living experience. This alone will save them in
          the time of trouble before us. Then their work will be tried, of what sort it is. If it is gold, silver, and
          precious stones, they will be hid as in the secret of the Lord’s pavilion. But if their work is wood, hay,
          stubble, nothing can shield them from the ﬁerceness of Jehovah’s wrath....</p>
      <p>Those who are willing to make any and every sacriﬁce for eternal life will have it, and it will be worth
          suffering for, worth crucifying self for, and sacriﬁcing every idol for. The far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory outweighs every earthly treasure and eclipses every earthly attraction.<span
