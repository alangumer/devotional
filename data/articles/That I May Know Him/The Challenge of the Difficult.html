    <h1>The Challenge of the Difﬁcult</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not
          be able. Luke 13:24.</strong></p>
      <p>A strait gate means a gate difﬁcult to enter. By this illustration Christ showed how hard it is for men and
          women to leave the world and the attractions it holds, and heartily and lovingly obey the commandments of God.
          The wide gate is easy to enter. Entrance through it does not call for the restrictions which are painful to
          the human heart. <nobr>Self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> are not seen in the broad way. There
          depraved appetite and natural inclinations ﬁnd abundant room. There may be seen <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr>
          pride, envy, evil surmisings, love of money, <nobr>self-exaltation.<span class="ft11">32</span></nobr></p>
      <p>Said Christ, <nobr>“Strive”—agonize—“to</nobr> enter in....” We must feel our continual dependence upon God and
          the</p>
      <p>great weakness of our own wisdom and our own judgment and strength, and then depend wholly upon Him who has
          conquered the foe in our behalf, because He pitied our weakness and knew we should be overcome and perish if
          He did not come to our help.... Think not that by any easy or common effort you can win the eternal</p>
      <p>reward. You have a wily foe upon your track. “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
          even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne” (Revelation 3:21). Here is the battle
          to overcome as Christ has overcome. His life of temptation, of trial, of toil and conﬂict, is before us for us
          to imitate. We may make efforts in our own strength, but not succeed. But when we fall all helpless and
          suffering and needy upon the Rock of Christ, feeling in our inmost soul that our victory depends upon His
          merits, that all our efforts of themselves without the special help of the great Conqueror will be without
          avail, then Christ would send every angel out of glory to rescue us from the power of the enemy rather than
          that we should fall.<span class="ft17">33</span></p>
      <p>We need to see that the way is narrow, and the gate strait. But as we pass through the strait gate, the
          wideness is without limit.<span class="ft15">34</span></p>
