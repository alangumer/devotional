    <h1>Privileges Without Limit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,
          nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. Psalm 1:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who have the blessing of the Lord are highly favored.... Be sure, then, that you do not choose the</p>
      <p>ungodly as your companions, for they will inﬂuence you to do those very things that will displease God and
          deprive you of His blessing....</p>
      <p>When any open their minds and hearts to those who would advise them to do wrong in any way, then they are
          walking in the counsel of the ungodly.... They are standing in the way of sinners, ... and in the next
          step</p>
      <p>they will ﬁnd themselves sitting in the seat of the scornful unconcerned.... The message of mercy, of love,
          of</p>
      <p>peace, is scorned, and those who associate with this class will become like them, despisers of God’s mercy. It
          is surprising to see how far the inﬂuence of one ungodly youth may extend, what a power he becomes in the
          hands of Satan for evil, how much his counsels are heeded, how much sorrow and sadness and grief he can
          bring....</p>
      <p>The privileges granted to the children of God are without <nobr>limit—to</nobr> be connected with Jesus Christ,
          who throughout the universe of heaven and worlds that have not fallen is adored by every heart, and His
          praises sung by every tongue; to be children of God, to bear His name, to become a member of the royal family;
          to be ranged under the banner of Prince Emmanuel, the King of kings and Lord of lords. His word is obeyed by
          the highest intelligences....</p>
      <p>The lowliest service done for Jesus is the greatest honor mortals can enjoy. Angels, pure and holy, obey His
          word; and shall we be deceived and deluded into the service of Satan? Shall we refuse obedience to His
          requirements? Shall it not be said of us individually, “But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his
          law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
          forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.”<span
