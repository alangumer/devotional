    <h1>Christ’s Representatives in the World</h1>

      <p><strong>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
          truth. John 17:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus ... says, “I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctiﬁed through the truth” (John 17:19). “Thy word
          is truth.” We need, then, to become familiar with the Word of God, to study and to practice it in life.... We
          deny</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ as the One who taketh away the sins of the world if we do not, after accepting the truth, reveal
          to the world the sanctifying effects of the truth on our own characters. If we are not better men and women,
          if we are not more kindhearted, more pitiful, more courteous, more full of tenderness and love, if we do not
          manifest to others the love that led Jesus to the world on His mission of mercy, we are not witnesses to the
          world of the power of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Jesus lived not to please Himself. He gave Himself as a living, consuming sacriﬁce for the good of others. He
          came to elevate, to ennoble, to make happy all with whom He came in contact. Those who receive Christ will
          drop out all that is uncourteous, harsh, and rough, and will reveal the pleasantness, the kindness, that dwelt
          in Jesus, because Christ abides in the heart by faith. Christ was the light that shineth in darkness, and His
          followers are also to be the light of the world. They are to kindle their taper from the divine altar. The
          character that is sanctiﬁed through the truth adds the perfect polish.</p>
      <p>Christ is our model, but unless we behold Him, unless we contemplate His character, we shall not reﬂect His
          character in our practical life. He was meek and lowly in heart. He never did a rude action, never spoke a
          discourteous word. The Lord is not pleased with our blunt, hard, unsympathetic ways toward others. All this
          selﬁshness must be purged away from our characters, and we must wear the yoke of Christ. Then we ... shall be
          ﬁtting up for the society of heavenly angels. We are to be in the world but not of the world. We are to be a
          representation of Jesus Christ. As the Lord of life and glory came to our world to represent the Father, so we
          are to go to the world to represent Jesus.<span class="ft11">36</span></p>
