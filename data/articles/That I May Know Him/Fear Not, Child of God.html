    <h1>Fear Not, Child of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me,
          Fear not; I am the ﬁrst and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore,
          Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. Revelation 1:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>John, exiled upon the Isle of Patmos, ... hears a voice saying, “I am Alpha and Omega, the ﬁrst and the last”
          (Revelation 1:11). At the sound of the voice John falls down in astonishment as if dead. He is unable to bear
          the sight of the divine glory. But a hand raises John up, and the voice he remembers as the voice of his
          Master. He is strengthened and can endure to talk with the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>So will it be with the remnant people of God who are <nobr>scattered—some</nobr> in the mountain fastnesses,
          some exiled, some pursued, some persecuted. When the voice of God is heard and the brightness of the glory is
          revealed, when the trial is over, the dross removed, they know they are in the presence of One who has
          redeemed them by His own blood. Just what Christ was to John in his exile He will be to His people who are
          made to feel the hand of oppression for the faith and testimony of Jesus Christ.... These were driven by the
          storm and tempest</p>
      <p>of persecution to the crevices of the rocks, but were hiding in the Rock of Ages; and in the fastnesses of the
          mountains, in the caves and dens of the earth, the Saviour reveals His presence and His glory. Yet a little
          while, and He that is to come will come and will not tarry. His eyes as a ﬂame of ﬁre penetrate into the
          <nobr>fast-closed</nobr> dungeons and hunt out the hidden ones, for their names are written in the Lamb’s book
          of life. These eyes of the Saviour are above us, around us, noting every difﬁculty, discerning every danger;
          and there is no place where His eyes cannot penetrate, no sorrows and sufferings of His people where the
          sympathy of Christ does not reach....</p>
      <p>The child of God will be <nobr>terror-stricken</nobr> at the ﬁrst sight of the majesty of Jesus Christ. He
          feels that he cannot live in His holy presence. But the word comes to him as to John, “Fear not.” Jesus laid
          His right hand upon John; He raised him up from his prostrate position. So will He do unto His loyal, trusting
          ones.<span class="ft17">23</span></p>
