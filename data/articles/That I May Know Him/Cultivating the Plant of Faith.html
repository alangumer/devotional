    <h1>Cultivating the Plant of Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. Luke 17:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Faith should be cultivated. If it has become weak it is like a sickly plant that should be placed in the
          sunshine and carefully watered and tended. The Lord would have every one who has had light and evidence
          cherish that light and walk in its brightness. God has blessed us with reasoning powers so that we may trace
          from cause to effect. If we would have light we must come to the light. We must individually lay hold on the
          hope set before us in the gospel.... How foolish it would be to go into a cellar, and mourn because we were in
          the dark. If we want</p>
      <p>light we must come up into a higher room. It is our privilege to come into the light, to come into the presence
          of God....</p>
      <p>We should grow daily in faith in order that we may grow up to the full measure of the spiritual stature in
          Christ Jesus. We should believe that God will answer our prayers, and not trust to feeling. We should say, My
          gloomy feelings are no evidence that God has not heard me. I do not want to give up on account of these sad
          emotions, for “faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).
          The rainbow of promise encircles the throne of God. I come to the throne, pointing to the sign of God’s
          faithfulness, and cherish the faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul.</p>
      <p>We are not to believe because we feel or see that God hears us. We are to trust to the promise of God. We are
          to go about our business believing that God will do just what He has said He would do, and that the blessings
          we have prayed for will come to us when we most need them. Every petition enters into the heart of God when we
          come believing. We have not faith enough. We should look upon our heavenly Father as more willing to help us
          than an earthly parent is to help his child. Why not trust Him?</p>
      <p>“He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us
          all things?” (Romans 8:32).<span class="ft15">17</span></p>
