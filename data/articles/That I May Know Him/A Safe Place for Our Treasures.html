    <h1>A Safe Place for Our Treasures</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
          break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
          corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart
          be also. Matthew <nobr>6:19-21.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Mark these words of the Great Teacher, who spake as never man spake. He sets before you the course to pursue if
          you would serve your best interests in this life, and lay up for yourselves an eternal treasure. “Lay not up
          for yourselves treasures upon earth.” There is danger of losing all in the pursuit of worldly gain, for in the
          feverish eagerness for earthly treasure, higher interests are forgotten....</p>
      <p>If your thoughts, your plans, your purposes, are all directed toward the accumulation of the things of earth,
          your anxiety, your study, your interests, will all be centered upon the world. The heavenly attractions will
          lose their beauty. The glories of the eternal world will cease to have the force of reality to you. Your heart
          will be with your treasure, and every faculty of your mind will be so concentrated on the work you have chosen
          that you will not heed the warnings and entreaties of the Word and Spirit of God. You will have no time to
          devote to the study of the Scriptures and to earnest prayer that you may escape the snares of Satan.<span

      <p>This work of transferring your possessions to the world above is worthy of all your best energies. It is of the
          highest importance, and involves your eternal interests. That which you bestow in the cause of God is not
          lost. All that is given for the salvation of souls and the glory of God is invested in the most successful
          enterprise in this life and in the life to come. Your talents of gold and silver, if given to the exchangers,
          are gaining continually in value, which will be registered to your account in the kingdom of heaven. You are
          to be the recipients of the eternal wealth that has increased in the hands of the exchangers. In giving to the
          work of God, you are laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven. All that you lay up above is secure from
          disaster and loss and is increasing to an eternal, and enduring, substance.<span class="ft17">8</span></p>
