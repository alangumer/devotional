    <h1>Praise, Like Clear-ﬂowing Streams</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: to
          shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. Psalm 92:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>When the truth is appreciated, ... we have a sense of the great mercy and <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> of God.
          While we review not the dark chapters in our experience to complain, but the manifestations of His great mercy
          and unfailing love and power revealed in our deliverance, we will praise far more than complain. We will talk
          of the loving faithfulness of God, as the true, tender, compassionate Shepherd of His ﬂock, which He has
          declared none shall pluck out of His hand. The language of the heart will not be selﬁsh murmuring and
          repining, but praise, like <nobr>clear-ﬂowing</nobr> streams, will come from God’s truly believing
          ones....</p>
      <p>The Lord is full of resources. He has no lack of facilities. It is because of our lack of faith, our
          earthliness, our cheap talk, our unbelief, that dark shadows gather about us....</p>
      <p>The temple of God is opened in heaven, and the threshold is ﬂushed with the glory that is for every church that
          will love God and keep His commandments. We need to study, to meditate, and to pray. Then we shall have
          spiritual eyesight to discern the inner courts of the celestial temple. We shall catch the themes of song and
          thanksgiving of the heavenly choir round about the throne. When Zion shall arise and shine, her light will be
          most penetrating, and precious songs of praise and thanksgiving will be heard in the assembly of the saints.
          Murmurings, complainings, and lamentations over little disappointments and difﬁculties will be lost sight of.
          As we apply the golden eyesalve we shall see the glories beyond. Faith will cut through the hellish shadow of
          Satan, and we shall see our Advocate offering up the incense of His own merits in our behalf....</p>
      <p>Let us take up the praise of God here below. Let us unite with the heavenly company above. Then we shall
          represent the truth as it <nobr>is—a</nobr> power to all who believe.<span class="ft15">30</span></p>
