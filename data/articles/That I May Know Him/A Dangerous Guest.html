    <h1>A Dangerous Guest</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? Mark 4:40.</strong></p>
      <p>Why are we so weak in faith? ... We are so faithless, so unbelieving, that the Lord cannot do for us those
          things which He longs to do. There are doubts in our minds that are very saddening and very difﬁcult to
          dispel.</p>
      <p>These doubts that bow down the soul we should each one bravely face, and tell the soul that we must conquer
          them at once. Make no delay, for there can be no peace where faith is lost. We need not express these doubts,
          for they may cause some poor soul to stumble. But examine them in the light of God’s Word, then talk them over
          with Jesus with His Word of promise in your hand, and pray for their removal. Tell the Lord, “Lord, I believe;
          help thou mine unbelief” (Mark 9:24). Let not doubt be placed in a comfortable, easy chair. It is a dangerous
          guest when it is left to rankle in the mind and counteract faith....</p>
      <p>Genuine faith is life, and where there is life there is growth. The life which Jesus imparts cannot but grow
          more and more abundantly. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a conﬁding trust, by which the soul
          becomes a conquering power. He who drinks of the water of life which Jesus gives, possesses within himself a
          well of water springing up into everlasting life. Though it shall be cut off from all created springs, it is
          fed from the hidden fountain. It is a perpetual spring, in immediate communication with the inexhaustible
          fountain of life.</p>
      <p>The Lord is dishonored when any who profess His name have an emptiness. This misrepresents God. Nothing but
          Christ manifested in spirit and life and character can reveal God to a world that knows Him not. The soul
          renewed in the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, demonstrates its divine fullness in a
          living. growing <nobr>experience—even</nobr> the fullness of Him that ﬁlleth all things.<span
