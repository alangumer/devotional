    <h1>The Christian’s Safeguard</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all
          perseverance and supplication for all saints. Ephesians 6:18.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a feverish love of pleasure at this time, a fearful increase of licentiousness, a contempt for all
          authority. Not only worldlings but professed Christians also are governed by inclination rather than duty. The
          words of Christ are sounding down through the ages, “Watch and pray” (Matthew 26:41).<span
          class="ft11">20</span></p>
      <p>Watchfulness and vigilance are needed now as never before in the history of the race. The eye must be turned
          off from beholding vanity. Lawlessness, the prevailing spirit of the age, must be met with a decided rebuke.
          Let none feel that they are in no danger. As long as Satan lives, his efforts will be constant and untiring to
          make the world as wicked as before the Flood and as licentious as were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah.
          The prayer may well be offered daily by those who have the fear of God before them, that He will preserve
          their hearts from evil desires and strengthen their souls to resist temptation. Those who in their
          <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> feel no need of watchfulness and unceasing prayer are near some humiliating fall.
          All who do not feel the importance of resolutely guarding their affections will be captivated by those who
          practice their arts to ensnare and lead astray the unwary. Men may have a knowledge of divine things and an
          ability to ﬁll an important place in the work of God, yet, unless they cherish a simple faith in their
          Redeemer they will be ensnared and overcome by the enemy.</p>
      <p>It is because the duties of watchfulness and prayer have been so sadly neglected that there is so great a lack
          of moral power. This is why so many who have a form of godliness bring forth no corresponding works. A
          careless indifference, a carnal security concerning religious duties and eternal things, prevails to an
          alarming extent. The Word of God exhorts us to be found “praying always ... , and watching thereunto with all
          perseverance....” Here</p>
      <p>is the Christian’s safeguard, his protection amid the perils that surround his pathway.<span
