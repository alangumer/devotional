      <p><strong>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. Acts 10:35.
          Jesus taught that the religion of the Bible does not consist in selﬁsh exclusiveness, in personal enjoyment,
          but in the doing of loving deeds, in bringing the greatest good to others, in genuine goodness.... His life
          was free</strong></p>
      <p>from all pride and ostentation.... Although He was the Creator of all worlds He yet testiﬁed of Himself while
          on</p>
      <p>earth that “the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay
          his head” (Matthew 8:20)....</p>
      <p>Jesus was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, and yet in His human life He was patient, kind, courteous,
          benevolent, full of love for little children, and full of pity and compassion for the tempted, the tried, and
          the oppressed. Of Himself He said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach
          the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
          recovering of sight to the blind, to set a liberty them that are bruised,....” (Luke 4:18, 19).</p>
      <p>Coming to earth to fulﬁll so gracious a mission, He was yet homeless, and often hungry and athirst. The men of
          His own nation hunted Him with craft and intrigue, with jealousy and hatred....</p>
      <p>He died a most shameful death, and made a full and complete sacriﬁce, in order that no one might perish, but
          that all might come to repentance. He made an atonement for every repenting, believing soul, in order that all
          might ﬁnd in Him a sin bearer. If those who believe in Him will but practice His words, which are spirit and
          life; if they will follow His example, and become a precious light to the world, they will do that for the
          world which no human philosophy can accomplish. The lessons of Christ lay a foundation for a religion in which
          there is no <nobr>caste—where</nobr> Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are linked in a common brotherhood, equal
          before God, because they are all branches of the living Vine. They believe in Christ as their personal
          Saviour.<span class="ft17">6</span></p>
