    <h1>A Progressive Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,
          and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Hebrews 11:6.</strong></p>
      <p>The time has come when we are to expect large blessings from the Lord. We must rise to a higher standard on the
          subject of faith. We have too little faith. The Word of God is our endorsement. We must take it, simply
          believing every word. With this assurance we may claim large things, and according to our faith it will be
          unto us....</p>
      <p>The work of faith means more than we think. It means genuine reliance upon the naked word of God. By our
          actions we are to show that we believe that God will do just as He has said. The wheels of nature and of
          providence are not appointed to roll backward nor to stand still. We must have an advancing, working faith, a
          faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul from every vestige of selﬁshness. It is not self, but God, that
          we must depend upon. We must not cherish unbelief. We must have that faith that takes God at His word....</p>
      <p>True faith consists in doing just what God has enjoined, not manufacturing things He has not enjoined. Justice,
          truth, mercy, are the fruit of faith. We need to walk in the light of God’s law; then good works will be the
          fruit of our faith, the proceeds of a heart renewed every day. The tree must be made good before the fruit can
          be good. We must be wholly consecrated to God. Our will must be made right before the fruit can be good. We
          must have no ﬁtful religion. “Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).</p>
      <p>O what a ﬁeld is opened before me! Our people must have the deep working of the Spirit of God every day. They
          must have a faith that works by love, a faith that emanates from God. There must not be a thread of selﬁshness
          drawn into the fabric. When our faith works by love, just such a love as Christ revealed in His life, it will
          be of a ﬁrm texture; it will be the fruit of a will subdued. But not until self dies can Christ live in us.
          Not until self dies can we possess a faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul.<span
