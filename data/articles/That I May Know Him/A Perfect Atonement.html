    <h1>A Perfect Atonement</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
          atonement. Romans 5:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Our great High Priest completed the sacriﬁcial offering of Himself when He suffered without the gate. Then a
          perfect atonement was made for the sins of the people. Jesus is our Advocate, our High Priest, our
          Intercessor. Our present position therefore is like that of the Israelites, standing in the outer court,
          waiting and looking for that blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
          Christ....</p>
      <p>When the high priest entered the holy place, representing the place where our High Priest is now pleading, and
          offered sacriﬁce on the altar, no propitiatory sacriﬁces were offered without. While the high priest was
          interceding within, every heart was to be bowed in contrition before God, pleading for the pardon of
          transgression. Type met antitype in the death of Christ, the Lamb slain for the sins of the world. The great
          High Priest has made the only sacriﬁce that will be of any value....</p>
      <p>In His intercession as our Advocate, Christ needs no man’s virtue, no man’s intercession. Christ is the only
          sin bearer, the only sin offering. Prayer and confession are to be offered only to Him who has entered once
          for all into the holy place....</p>
      <p>Christ represented His Father to the world, and He represents before God the chosen ones in whom He has
          restored the moral image of God. They are His heritage.... No priest, no religionist, can reveal the Father to
          any</p>
      <p>son or daughter of Adam. Men have only one Advocate, one Intercessor, who is able to pardon transgression.
          Shall not our hearts swell with gratitude to Him who gave Jesus to be the propitiation for our sins? Think
          deeply upon the love the Father has manifested in our behalf, the love that He has expressed for us. We cannot
          measure this love. Measurement there is none. We can only point to Calvary, to the Lamb slain from the
          foundation of the world. It is an inﬁnite sacriﬁce. Can we comprehend and measure inﬁnity?<span
