    <h1>A Light to the Young</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, ﬁlled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
          Luke 2:40.</strong></p>
      <p>The example of Jesus is a light to the young as well as to those of mature years, for His was a representative
          childhood and youth. From His earliest years His example was perfect. In both His physical and His spiritual
          nature He followed the divine order of growth illustrated by the plant, as He wishes all youth to do. Although
          He was the majesty of heaven, the King of glory, He became a babe in Bethlehem, and for a time represented the
          helpless infant in its mother’s care. In childhood He did the works of an obedient child. He spoke and acted
          with the wisdom of a child and not of a man, honoring His parents, and carrying out their wishes in helpful
          ways, according to the ability of a child. But at each stage of His development He was perfect, with the
          simple, natural grace of a sinless life.<span class="ft11">42</span></p>
      <p>Joseph, and especially Mary, kept before them the remembrance of their child’s divine Fatherhood. Jesus was
          instructed in accordance with the sacred character of His mission. His inclination to right was a constant
          gratiﬁcation to His parents. The questions He asked them led them to study most earnestly the great elements
          of truth. His <nobr>soul-stirring</nobr> words about nature and the God of nature opened and enlightened their
          minds.</p>
      <p>On the rocks and knolls about His home the eye of the Son of God often rested. He was familiar with the things
          of nature. He saw the sun in the heavens, the moon and the stars fulﬁlling their mission. With the voice of
          singing He welcomed the morning light. He listened to the lark caroling forth music to its God, and joined His
          voice with the voice of praise and thanksgiving.<span class="ft11">43</span></p>
      <p>Quiet and gentle, He seemed as one who was set apart. Whenever He could He went out alone into the ﬁelds and on
          the mountainsides to commune with the God of nature. When His work was done He wandered by the lakeside, among
          the trees of the forest, and in the green valleys, where He could think about God and lift His soul to heaven
          in prayer.<span class="ft11">44</span></p>
