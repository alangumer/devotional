    <h1>The Voice of Nature</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. Genesis 1:31.</strong></p>
      <p>God does not design that we shall take no pleasure in the things of His creation.... He watches with a
          Father’s</p>
      <p>joy the delight of His children in the beautiful things around them. While on earth the Redeemer of the world
          sought to make His lessons of instruction plain and simple, that all might comprehend them; and can we be
          surprised that He should choose the open air as His sanctuary, that He should desire to be surrounded by the
          works of His creation? ... The things which His own hand had made He took as His lesson book. He saw in them
          more than ﬁnite minds could comprehend.</p>
      <p>The birds, caroling forth their songs without a care, the ﬂowers of the valley glowing in their beauty, the
          lily that reposed in its purity on the bosom of the lake, the lofty trees, the cultivated land, the waving
          grain, the barren soil, the tree that bore no fruit, the everlasting hills, the bubbling stream, the setting
          sun tinting and gilding the <nobr>heavens—all</nobr> these He employed to impress His hearers with divine
          truth. He connected the work of God’s ﬁnger in the heavens and upon the earth with the Word of life. From
          these He drew His lessons of spiritual instruction. He would pluck the lilies, the ﬂowers of the valley, and
          place them in the hands of the little children, as instructors to proclaim the truth of His Word....</p>
      <p>The beauties of nature have a tongue that speaks to us without ceasing. The open heart can be impressed with
          the love and glory of God as seen in the works of His hand. The listening ear can hear and understand the
          communications of God through the things of nature. There is a lesson in the sunbeam and in the various
          objects of nature that God has presented to our view. The green ﬁelds, the lofty trees, the buds and ﬂowers,
          the passing cloud, the falling rain, the babbling brook, the sun, moon, and stars in the
          <nobr>heavens—all</nobr> invite our attention and meditation, and bid us become acquainted with Him who made
          them all.<span class="ft17">23</span></p>
