    <h1>Revealing Christ in Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity,
          sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having
          no evil thing to say of you. Titus 2:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>Let not anyone be afraid of going to extremes while he is a close student of the Word, humbling the soul at
          every step. Christ must dwell in him by faith. He, their Exemplar, was <nobr>self-possessed.</nobr> He walked
          in humility. He had true dignity. He had patience. If we individually possess these traits... there will be no
          extremists.</p>
      <p>Christ never erred in His judgment of men and of truth. He was never deceived by appearances. He never raised a
          question but what was clearly appropriate. He never gave an answer but what was ﬁtting and right to the point.
          He silenced the voice of the cavilling, shrewd, and cunning priests by penetrating through the surface and
          reaching the heart, ﬂashing light into their consciences, which annoyed them; but they would not yield to
          conviction. Christ never went to extremes, never lost <nobr>self-control</nobr> or the balance of mind under
          any excitement. He never violated the law of good taste and discernment when to speak and when to keep silent.
          Then if all who claim to see the precious golden rays of the light of the Sun of Righteousness will follow the
          example of Christ there will be no extremists....</p>
      <p>Let calmness and <nobr>self-possession</nobr> be cultivated and perseveringly maintained, for this was the
          character of Christ.... We hear no noisy protestations of faith, nor do we see tremendous bodily contortions
          and exercises in</p>
      <p>the Author of all truth.</p>
      <p>Remember, in Him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. If Christ is abiding in our hearts by faith, we
          shall, by beholding the manner of His life, seek to be like <nobr>Jesus—pure,</nobr> peaceable, and undeﬁled.
          We shall reveal Christ in our character. We will not only receive and absorb light but will also diffuse it.
          We will have more clear and distinct views of what Jesus is to us. The symmetry, loveliness, and benevolence
          that were in the life of Jesus Christ will be shining forth in our lives.<span class="ft11">29</span></p>
