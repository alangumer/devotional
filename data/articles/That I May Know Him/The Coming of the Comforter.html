    <h1>The Coming of the Comforter</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for
          ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him:
          but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. John 14:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ was about to depart to His home in the heavenly courts, but He assured His disciples that He would send
          them the Comforter, who would abide with them forever. To the guidance of this Comforter all may implicitly
          trust. He is the Spirit of truth; but this truth the world can neither see nor receive....</p>
      <p>Christ desired His disciples to understand that He would not leave them orphans. “I will not leave you
          comfortless,” He declared: “I will come to you” (John 14:18, 19).... Precious, glorious assurance of eternal
          life!</p>
      <p>Even though He was to be absent, their relation to Him was to be that of a child to its parent....</p>
      <p>The words spoken to the disciples come to us through their words. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs, at
          all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afﬂiction, when the outlook seems dark and the future
          perplexing and we feel helpless and alone. These are times when the Comforter will be sent in answer to the
          prayer of faith.</p>
      <p>There is no comforter like Christ, so tender and so true. He is touched with the feeling of our inﬁrmities. His
          Spirit speaks to the heart. Circumstances may separate us from our friends; the broad, restless ocean may roll
          between us and them. Though their sincere friendship may still exist, they may be unable to demonstrate it by
          doing for us that which would be gratefully received. But no circumstances, no distance, can separate us from
          the heavenly Comforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is always there, one given in Christ’s place,
          to act in His stead. He is always at our right hand, to speak soothing, gentle words, to support, sustain,
          uphold, and cheer. The inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. This Spirit works in and
          through every one who receives Christ. Those who know the indwelling of this Spirit reveal its
          <nobr>fruit—love,</nobr> joy, peace, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, goodness, faith.<span
