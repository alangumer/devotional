    <h1>Christ the Good Shepherd</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know
          I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. John 10:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus says, “I know my sheep.” Let us consider this statement. We are known by God before we receive Him. “I
          know my sheep.” How do souls become Christ’s sheep? By choosing to receive Him. But Christ had ﬁrst chosen
          them. He knew every one who would respond to His drawing, and He knew every one who would be inclined to
          receive Him but who, through popular opposing inﬂuences, would turn from Him, John says to all, “Behold the
          Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Those who heard the voice and did behold
          Jesus as the Lamb of God believed in Him and became His property from their own choice. But ...</p>
      <p>their choosing of Christ was in response to His drawing. The love of Jesus was expressed to us before we loved
          Him....</p>
      <p>To Jesus the whole human family is entrusted, as the ﬂocks of sheep are entrusted to a shepherd. These sheep
          and lambs are to be tended with pastoral care. They will be guarded by the faithful Chief Shepherd, under the
          care of faithful under shepherds, and if they will obey the voice of the Chief Shepherd they will not be left
          to be devoured by wolves....</p>
      <p>Jesus says, “My sheep hear my voice, ... and they follow me” (John 10:27). The Shepherd of Israel does not
          drive His ﬂock, but He leads them. His attitude is wholly one of invitation. “My sheep hear my voice.” If we
          are indeed sons and daughters of God we not only hear, but recognize the voice above all others. We appreciate
          the words of Christ, we distinguish the truth as it is in Jesus from all error, and the truth refreshes the
          soul, and ﬁlls it with gladness....</p>
      <p>The beautiful illustration in Revelation 7 is a pastoral symbol. “... They shall hunger no more, neither thirst
          any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne
          shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters ...” (Revelation 7:16, 17).<span
