    <h1>Truth a Divine Sentinel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in
          charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 1 Timothy 4:12.</strong></p>
      <p>I appeal to the youth. Consider your ways....</p>
      <p>No youth can withstand the temptations of Satan if the truth, with its purifying, uplifting power, is not
          abiding in the heart. Truth has a correcting inﬂuence upon the life. It is a divine sentinel, keeping watch in
          your souls and rousing to action against Satan’s assaults. Under the divine inﬂuence of truth the mind will be
          strengthened, the intellect invigorated, and there will be a growing up in the knowledge of the only true God,
          and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Do not tarnish the truth by indulging in habits and practices that are
          inconsistent with its holy character, but hold it as a treasure of highest value....</p>
      <p>The Lord desires you to understand the position you occupy as sons and daughters of the Most High, children of
          the Heavenly King. He desires you to live in close connection with Him.... Determine that you will be on
          the</p>
      <p>Lord’s side. If you will stand under the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Prince Emmanuel, faithfully doing
          His service, you need never yield to temptation, for One stands by your side who is able to keep you from
          falling. Every youth is granted a probation in which to form a character for the future, immortal life.
          Precious, golden moments these will be to you if you improve them according to the light God is permitting to
          shine upon you from His throne....</p>
      <p>Will the youth turn their faces heavenward? Will they open the chambers of the mind to the Sun of
          Righteousness? Will they throw open the door of the heart and welcome Jesus in? What beauty of character shone
          forth in the daily life of Christ! He is to be our pattern. There is a great work to be done in fashioning the
          character after the divine similitude. The grace of Christ must mold the entire being, and its triumph will
          not be complete until the heavenly universe shall witness habitual tenderness of feeling, Christlike love, and
          holy deeds in the deportment of the children of God.<span class="ft11">22</span></p>
