    <h1>God’s Law Changeless and Eternal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulﬁl.
          For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
          law, till all be fulﬁlled. Matthew 5:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>If Satan’s work had succeeded in heaven the law of God would have been changed, but this could not be, for His
          law was a transcript of His character and as unchangeable as His character. If any change was possible in the
          law of God it would have been made then and there and saved the rebellion in heaven. But as it was not altered
          to meet the request of Satan, he ... lost his high and holy position in the heavenly courts.</p>
      <p>After his fall he worked upon the minds of Adam and Eve and seduced them from their loyalty.... Now if</p>
      <p>the law of God could have been changed and altered to meet man in his fallen condition, then Adam would have
          been pardoned and retained his home in Eden; but the penalty of transgression was death, and Christ became
          man’s substitute and surety. Then was the time, could the law of God have been changed, to have made this
          change and retained Christ in the heavenly courts, that the immense sacriﬁce made to save a fallen race might
          have been avoided. But no, the law of God was changeless in its character and therefore Christ gave Himself a
          sacriﬁce in behalf of fallen man, and Adam lost Eden and was placed with all his posterity upon
          probation.</p>
      <p>Had the law of God been changed in one precept since the expulsion of Satan from heaven, he would have gained
          on earth after his fall that which he could not gain in heaven before his fall. He would have received all
          that he asked for. We know that he did not.... The law ... remains unalterable as the throne of God, and
          the</p>
      <p>salvation of every soul is determined by obedience or disobedience.... Jesus, by the law of sympathetic
          love,</p>
      <p>bore our sins, took our punishment, and drank the cup of the wrath of God apportioned to the transgressor....
          He</p>
      <p>bore the cross of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> for us, that we might have life,
          eternal life. Will we bear the cross for Jesus?<span class="ft15">12</span></p>
