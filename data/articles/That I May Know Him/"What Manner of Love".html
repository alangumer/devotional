    <h1>“What Manner of Love”!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:
          therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 1 John 3:1.</strong></p>
      <p>“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God” (John 1:12).... “For as</p>
      <p>many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
          again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself
          beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God,
          and <nobr>joint-heirs</nobr> with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also gloriﬁed
          together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory
          which shall be revealed in us” (Romans <nobr>8:14-18).</nobr></p>
      <p>John cannot ﬁnd adequate words wherein to describe the amazing love of God to sinful man, but he calls upon all
          to behold the love of God revealed in the gift of His only begotten Son. Through the perfection of the
          sacriﬁce given for the guilty race, those who believe in Christ ... may be saved from eternal ruin. Christ was
          one with the Father, yet when sin entered our world through Adam’s transgression, He was willing to step down
          from the exaltation of One who was equal with God, who dwelt in light unapproachable by humanity, so full of
          glory that no man could behold His face and live, and submit to insult, mockery, suffering, pain, and death,
          in order to answer the claims of the immutable law of God, and make a way of escape for the transgressor by
          His death and righteousness. This was the work which His Father gave Him to do, and those who accept Christ,
          relying wholly upon His merits, are made the adopted sons and daughters of <nobr>God—are</nobr> heirs of God,
          and joint heirs with Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>Let no one ... think that it is a condescension for any man, however talented or learned or honored, to accept
          Christ. Every human being should look to heaven with reverence and gratitude, and exclaim with amazement,
          “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us.”<span class="ft11">30</span></p>
