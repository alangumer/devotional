      <p><strong>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek
          the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. Hosea 10:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Let every church member consider the breaking up of the fallow ground, the careful cleansing of the soil, and
          the depositing and harrowing of the seed, which is the laborious work of the husbandman. It is a rough and
          searching process. The harrowing of the seed is not always pleasant to the receiver, and sometimes disabling
          to him because he does not sense the virtue of the Word and become submissive under the tilling process in
          spiritual life. The sins committed require the sincere repentance that needeth not to be repented of, but when
          the hard soil is broken up and the stubborn clods are broken to pieces then the precious seed can be sown and
          harrowed into the soil. This represents the severe discipline of God. Often rebellion is manifested, and the
          discipline of God must continue until the determined will is broken and the end is gained.</p>
      <p>In things spiritual as well as natural this work must be done. Often severity is needed to bring in the
          spiritual harvest. It is God’s great law that without the proper sowing of seed and the tillage there will be
          no harvest in sheaves. An experience is lacking. Divine blessings wait only for human spiritual working of the
          soil of the heart and the industry to care for the soil while the Lord is sowing His seed.</p>
      <p>As a man soweth he shall also reap. All who study the Word with full purpose to cleanse away from the life all
          sin, and who search the Scriptures to learn what is truth, will welcome the truth of the Word as a Thus saith
          the Lord. They will repent under the sharp reproofs of Bible truth.... If a man sow true repentance he will
          reap the</p>
      <p>reward of sound good works. If he continues in the faith he reaps peace. If he becomes sanctiﬁed and cleansed
          from his appetite for cheapness and folly he shall ... reap righteousness and perfect love.... A continuance
          in the</p>
      <p>well doing in overcoming makes him a daily victor because he keeps the mark of Christ’s perfection ever before
          him.<span class="ft15">3</span></p>
