    <h1>Foundation of God’s Government</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulﬁlling of the law. Romans
          13:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The question of deepest interest to each one should be, Am I meeting the requirements of the law of God? That
          law is holy, just, and good, and God would have us daily compare our actions with this, His great standard of
          righteousness. Only by a close examination of self in the light of God’s Word can we discover our deviations
          from His holy rule of right....</p>
      <p>Love is the principle that underlies God’s government in heaven and on earth, and this love must be interwoven
          in the life of the Christian. The love of Christ is not a ﬁtful love; it is deep, and broad, and full. Its
          possessor will not say, “I will love only those who love me.” The heart that is inﬂuenced by this holy
          principle will be carried above everything of a selﬁsh nature.</p>
      <p>Even among professing Christians there are persons who are always on the watch for something at which to take
          offense. If their friends are absorbed in matters that require their attention and have no time to devote to
          them, they feel slighted and injured.... Their lives are like the gorgeous ﬂowers which possess no
          fragrance.</p>
      <p>Much to be preferred is the simple, unpretending blossom that blesses with its sweet odor those who come in
          contact with it.</p>
      <p>Instead of ﬁnding fault with others, these persons should seek to become lovely by putting on Christ....
          The</p>
      <p>character of Christ is the standard which the Christian is to keep before him. His aim should be to possess
          those graces that were exempliﬁed in the life of Christ in humanity....</p>
      <p>The religion of Jesus Christ is not merely to prepare us for the future immortal life; it is to enable us to
          live the Christ life here on earth. Jesus is not only our pattern, He is also our friend and our guide, and by
          taking hold of His strong arm and partaking of His Spirit, we may walk “even as he walked.”<span
