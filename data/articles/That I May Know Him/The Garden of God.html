    <h1>The Garden of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For all ﬂesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the ﬂower of grass. The grass withereth, and the
          ﬂower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. 1 Peter 1:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>If our minds are open to the impressions of the Spirit of God, we may learn lessons from the simple and
          beautiful things of nature. I feel oppressed in the crowded cities where there is naught for the eyes to look
          upon but houses. The ﬂowers are to us constant teachers. The shrubs and ﬂowers gather to themselves the
          properties of earth and air which they appropriate to perfect the beautiful buds and blossoming ﬂowers for our
          happiness, but they are God’s preachers, and we are to consider the lessons which they teach us.</p>
      <p>Just so has God given us the precious promises throughout His Word. The Scriptures are open to us as the garden
          of God, and their promises are as fragrant ﬂowers blooming all over that garden. God especially calls our
          attention to the very ones that are appropriate for us. In these promises we may discern the character of God
          and read His love to us. They are the ground upon which our faith rests, the support and strength of our faith
          and hope, and through these we are to delight our souls in God and breathe in the fragrance of heaven. Through
          the precious promises He withdraws the veil from the future and gives us glimpses of the things which He has
          prepared for those who love Him....</p>
      <p>We should not regard them with carelessness or indifference. But as we would examine the precious ﬂowers,</p>
      <p>... delighting our senses with their loveliness and fragrance, just so we should take the promises of God, one
          by one, and examine them closely on every <nobr>side—take</nobr> in their richness, and be soothed, comforted,
          encouraged, and strengthened by them. God has provided for all the comforts the soul needs. They are suited to
          the friendless, the poverty stricken, the wealthy, the sick, the <nobr>bereaved—all</nobr> may have their
          appropriate help if they will see and take hold upon these by faith. God scatters blessings all along our path
          to brighten the rugged way of life, and we want to be receiving all the comfort and tokens of God’s love with
          grateful hearts.<span class="ft17">42</span></p>
