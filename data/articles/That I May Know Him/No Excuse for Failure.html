    <h1>No Excuse for Failure</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and
          that wicked one toucheth him not. 1 John 5:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Many fail to recognize the claims that God has upon them. They profess to be sons and daughters of God, but
          they do not behave as children of God. They argue that their evil habits and customs which they followed when
          they served under the black banner of the prince of darkness must be excused on the ground of their weakness,
          while they claim that “it is their way.” ... Their objectionable hereditary traits of character they choose to
          retain as idols.</p>
      <p>When a soul is truly converted, old habits and natural evil besetments are done away in Christ Jesus and all
          things become new. Among those who profess to be servants of Christ an earnest purpose should be cultivated,
          such as Daniel manifested in the courts of Babylon. He knew that God was his strength and his shield, his
          front guard and his rear guard. Amid the corruptions that surrounded him in the courts of Babylon he kept
          himself free from those sights and sounds which would allure him and draw him into temptation. When his duties
          required that he be present at scenes of revelry, intemperance, and basest idolatry, he cultivated the habit
          of silent prayer, and thus he was kept by the power of God. To have the mind uplifted to God will be a beneﬁt
          in all times and in all places....</p>
      <p>Let the soul cultivate the habit of contemplating the world’s Redeemer.... Help has been laid upon One
          that</p>
      <p>is mighty. Jesus has given His life, that every soul might have abundant help in Him....</p>
      <p>Will you who read these words resolve that you will never again seek to excuse your defects of character by
          saying, “It is my way”? Let no one declare, “I cannot change my natural habits and tendencies.” The truth must
          be admitted into the soul, and it will work the sanctiﬁcation of the character. It will reﬁne and elevate the
          life, and ﬁt you for an entrance into the mansions which Jesus has gone to prepare for those who love
          Him.<span class="ft17">44</span></p>
