    <h1>A Safe Hiding Place</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
          which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Revelation 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>God keeps a reckoning with the nations.... In this age a more than common contempt is shown to God.</p>
      <p>Men have reached a point in insolence and disobedience which shows that their cup of iniquity is almost
          full....</p>
      <p>The Spirit of God is being withdrawn from the earth. When the angel of mercy folds her wings and departs, Satan
          will do the evil deeds he has long wished to do. Storm and tempest, war and <nobr>bloodshed—in</nobr> these
          things he delights, and thus he gathers in his harvest. And so completely will men be deceived by him that
          they will declare that these calamities are the result of the desecration of the ﬁrst day of the week. From
          the pulpits of the popular churches will be heard the statement that the world is being punished because
          Sunday is not honored as it should be....</p>
      <p>Satan will bring in pleasing fables to meet the minds of all who love not the truth. With angry zeal he will
          accuse commandment keepers.... Satan claims the world, but there is a little company who withstand</p>
      <p>his devices and contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. Satan sets himself to destroy
          this <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> company. But God is their tower of defense. He will raise up for them a
          standard against the enemy. He will be to them “as an hiding place from the wind,” and “as the shadow of a
          great rock in a weary land” (Isaiah 32:2). He will say to them, “Come, my people, enter thou into thy
          chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
          overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their
          iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain” (Isaiah 26:20, 21). “And
          the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they
          shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall ﬂee away” (Isaiah 35:10).<span
