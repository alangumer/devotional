    <h1>No Room for Shirkers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they
          came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Judges 5:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Shall not this be the time when all who are in connection with God shall come to the front and show their
          colors? Shall it be seen that men and women step back and show no interest, no zeal, no earnest effort when
          help is needed? When the car drags heavily, then is the time for everyone to push, put shoulders to the
          wheels, and not stand back giving orders, or accusing the ones who are trying to push the load, or criticizing
          everything they do, because it is not done in their way and after their ideas.... Let everyone do his level
          best to move the load</p>
      <p>with might and strength....</p>
      <p>If the Lord should treat us as some who claim to be Christians treat one another, we should have a sore, hard
          time. If He should look upon the selﬁsh, or crooked ones as they look upon one another and deal with one
          another, what would become of us? But I am glad the Lord is not man. He bears with our crooked ways, our
          selﬁshness, our separation from Him, our defects of character, and seeks to inform us, sending message after
          message of mercy, encouragement, warning, reproof, and correction, to bring us into a right position before
          Him, that we may have His love, His care, His blessing, abiding upon us....</p>
      <p>We have each a work to do for the Master. Will we do this work, will we labor with unselﬁsh,
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> interest to build up His cause, to advance His work? I am determined to do the
          will of God, to make straight paths for my feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. There are halting,
          lame ones enough.... God forbid</p>
      <p>that any of those who have had a knowledge of, and an experience in, the workings of God should themselves be
          halting, and need to be carried. Let them come up to help; let them become spiritually strong by doing the
          will of our heavenly Father, and then they can help the halting, lame ones....</p>
      <p>May we work intelligently, heartily, with decision and positiveness, that we may be blessed and may bless
          others.<span class="ft15">27</span></p>
