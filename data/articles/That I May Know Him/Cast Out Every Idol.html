    <h1>Cast Out Every Idol</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
          God, and him only shalt thou serve. Matthew 4:10.</strong></p>
      <p>“Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3).... It is not alone in denying the existence of
          God</p>
      <p>or in bowing down to idols of wood and stone that this ﬁrst commandment is broken. By many who profess to be
          followers of Christ, its principles are infringed, but the Lord of heaven does not acknowledge those as His
          children who are cherishing in their hearts anything that takes the place which God alone should hold. With
          many the gratiﬁcation of appetite holds sway, while with others dress and love of the world are given the ﬁrst
          place in the heart....</p>
      <p>God has given us many things in this life upon which to bestow our affections, but when we carry to excess that
          which in itself is lawful we become idolaters.... Anything that separates our affections from God and
          lessens</p>
      <p>our interest in eternal things is an idol. Those who use the precious time given them by <nobr>God—time</nobr>
          that has been purchased at an inﬁnite <nobr>cost—in</nobr> embellishing their homes for display, in following
          the fashions and customs of the world, are not only robbing their own souls of spiritual food, but are failing
          to give God His due. The time thus spent in the gratiﬁcation of selﬁsh desires might be employed in obtaining
          a knowledge of the Word of God, in cultivating our talents, that we might render intelligent service to our
          Creator.... God will not share a divided</p>
      <p>heart. If the world absorbs our attention, He cannot reign supreme. If this diminishes our devotion for God, it
          is idolatry in His eyes....</p>
      <p>“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24). When our
          hearts are tuned to praise our Maker, not only in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs but also in our lives,
          we shall live in communion with Heaven.... There will be gratitude in the heart and in the home, in private as
          well</p>
      <p>as in public devotion. This constitutes the true worship of God.<span class="ft15">15</span></p>
