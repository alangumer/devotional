    <h1>A Heavenly Partnership</h1>

      <p><strong>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 1 Peter
          5:6.</strong></p>
      <p>All heaven enters into copartnership with those who come to Christ for eternal life, submitting themselves to
          Him as those who have made a surrender of all to God. God requires His servants to stand under the
          <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Prince Emmanuel, striving in His power to keep the principles of truth
          pure and uncorrupted. They must never step aside from the path of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and humility which
          every true Christian must travel. As they thus cooperate with God, Christ is formed within, “the hope of
          glory” (Colossians 1:27). Clad in His meekness and lowliness they ﬁnd their highest joy in doing His service.
          Earthly ambition gives way to a desire to serve the Master.</p>
      <p>“Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.” “The
          sacriﬁces of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise” (Psalm
          138:6; 51:17). Those who reveal the meek and lowly spirit of Christ are tenderly regarded by God. Nothing is
          unnoticed by Him. He marks their <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> their effort to uplift Christ before the world.
          Though these humble workers may be looked upon with scorn by the world, they are of great value in the sight
          of God. Not only the wise, the great, the beneﬁcent, will gain a passport into the heavenly
          <nobr>courts—not</nobr> only the busy worker, full of zeal and restless activity. No; the pure in heart, in
          whose lips there is found no guile; the poor in spirit, who are actuated by the Spirit of an abiding Christ;
          the peacemaker, whose highest ambition is to do God’s <nobr>will—these</nobr> will gain an abundant entrance.
          They are God’s jewels, and will be among that number of whom John writes, “I heard as it were the voice of a
          great multitude, ... saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth” (Revelation 19:6). They have
          washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. “Therefore are they before the throne of
          God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them”
          (Revelation 7:15).<span class="ft17">40</span></p>
