    <h1>Depths of Humiliation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of ﬂesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of
          the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. Hebrews
          2:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Wondrous combination of man and God! ... He humbled Himself to man’s nature. He did this that the Scripture
          might be fulﬁlled; and the plan was entered into by the Son of God, knowing all the steps in His humiliation,
          that He must descend to make an expiation for the sins of a condemned, groaning world. What humility was this!
          It amazed angels. The tongue can never describe it; the imagination cannot take it in. The eternal Word
          consented to be made ﬂesh! God became man! It was a wonderful humility.</p>
      <p>But He stepped still lower; the Man must humble Himself as a man to bear insult, reproach, shameful
          accusations, and abuse. There seemed to be no safe place for Him in His own territory. He had to ﬂee from
          place to place for His life. He was betrayed by one of His disciples; He was denied by one of His most zealous
          followers. He was mocked. He was crowned with a crown of thorns. He was scourged. He was forced to bear the
          burden of the cross.</p>
      <p>He was not insensible to this contempt and ignominy. He submitted, but, oh! He felt the bitterness as no other
          being could feel it. He was pure, holy, and undeﬁled, yet arraigned as a criminal! The adorable Redeemer
          stepped down from the highest exaltation. Step by step He humbled Himself to <nobr>die—but</nobr> what a
          death! It was the most shameful, the most <nobr>cruel—the</nobr> death upon the cross as a malefactor. He did
          not die as a hero in the eyes of the world, loaded with honors, as men in battle. He died as a condemned
          criminal, suspended between the heavens and the <nobr>earth—died</nobr> a lingering death of shame, exposed to
          the tauntings and revilings of a debased, <nobr>crime-loaded,</nobr> proﬂigate multitude! ...</p>
      <p>All this humiliation of the Majesty of heaven was for guilty, condemned man. He went lower and lower in His
          humiliation, until there were no lower depths that He could reach, in order to lift man up from his moral
          deﬁlement. All this was for you.<span class="ft11">3</span></p>
