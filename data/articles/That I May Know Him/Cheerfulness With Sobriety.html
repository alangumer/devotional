    <h1>Cheerfulness With Sobriety</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. Proverbs
          8:6.</strong></p>
      <p>[Early morning diary entry, July 12, 1897.] I ask that the Holy Spirit shall control my thoughts through the
          day. I plead for wisdom in judgment, clearness of brain, and understanding, that I may see the treasures in
          the Word of God and bring out the precious truth in the simplest language. Thus did the greatest Teacher the
          world ever knew.</p>
      <p>I feel more and more impressed with the greatness of the subject of the Lord’s soon appearing in the clouds of
          heaven, with power and great glory. This faith moves me greatly to observe due solemnity at all times and in
          all places, but while I enjoin upon myself and others to be sober, they are not to cherish sadness and
          gloom....</p>
      <p>While we are not to be gloomy, but cheerful and happy, there is to be no silliness, but a sobriety in harmony
          with our faith. Words and actions form character. Therefore our words should be clean, pure, simple, yet
          elevated. The gift of speech is a valuable talent, and the Lord has no pleasure in hearing low, cheap,
          degrading nonsense which tastes strongly of vice and revelry. No Christian should condescend to imitate and
          catch such habits from another.... These evil, silly words are discordant notes and contribute to the
          happiness of no one.</p>
      <p>They are a detriment to spirituality. The Word of God forbids them.</p>
      <p>“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil
          treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
          give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justiﬁed, and by thy words thou
          shalt be condemned” (Matthew <nobr>12:35-37).</nobr></p>
      <p>“And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?” (Matthew 9:4). Jesus reads the
          hearts and minds and thoughts.... There is a Witness present, tracing every word spoken and every act</p>
      <p>performed, good or evil.<span class="ft15">19</span></p>
