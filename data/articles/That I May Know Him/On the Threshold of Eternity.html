    <h1>On the Threshold of Eternity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
          then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians
          15:54.</strong></p>
      <p>How precious to those who are losing their loved of this world are their faith and hope in the promises of God
          which open before them the future immortal life! Their hopes may fasten upon unseen realities of the future
          world. Christ has risen from the dead the ﬁrst fruits. Hope and faith strengthen the soul to pass through the
          dark shadows of the tomb, in full faith of coming forth to immortal life in the morning of the resurrection.
          The Paradise of God, the home of the blessed! There all tears shall be wiped from off all faces! When Christ
          shall come the second time, to be “admired in all them that believe” (2 Thessalonians 1:10), death shall be
          swallowed up in victory, and there shall be no more sickness, no more sorrow, no more death! A rich promise is
          given to us: “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may
          enter in through the gates into the city” (Revelation 22:14). Is not this promise rich and comforting to those
          who love God?<span class="ft11">25</span></p>
      <p>The resurrection of Jesus was a sample of the ﬁnal resurrection of all who sleep in Him. The risen body of the
          Saviour, His deportment, the accents of His speech, were all familiar to His followers. In like manner will
          those who sleep in Jesus rise again. We shall know our friends even as the disciples knew Jesus. Though they
          may have been deformed, diseased, or disﬁgured in this mortal life, yet in their resurrected and gloriﬁed body
          their individual identity will be perfectly preserved, and we shall recognize, in the face radiant with the
          light shining from the face of Jesus, the lineaments of those we love.<span class="ft11">26</span></p>
      <p>The <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> will call up His purchased possession in the ﬁrst resurrection, and until that
          triumphant hour, when the last trump shall sound and the vast army shall come forth to eternal victory, every
          sleeping saint will be kept in safety and will be guarded as a precious jewel, who is known to God by
          name.<span class="ft17">27</span></p>
