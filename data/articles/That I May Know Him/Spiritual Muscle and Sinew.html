      <p><strong>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
          which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. James 1:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In seasons of temptation we seem to lose sight of the fact that God tests us that our faith may be tried and be
          found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus. The Lord places us in different positions to
          develop us. If we have defects of character of which we are not aware, He gives us discipline that will bring
          those defects to our knowledge, that we may overcome them. It is His providence that brings us into varying
          circumstances. In each new position, we meet a different class of temptations. How many times when we are
          placed in some trying situation we think, “This is a wonderful mistake. How I wish I had stayed where I was
          before.” But why is it that you are not satisﬁed? It is because your circumstances have served to bring new
          defects in your character to your notice, but nothing is revealed but that which was in you....</p>
      <p>It is coming in contact with difﬁculties that will give you spiritual muscle and sinew. You will become strong
          in Christ if you endure the testing process and the proving of God.... Remember when trials come that you
          are</p>
      <p>a spectacle to angels and to men, and that every time you fail to bear the proving of the Lord you are
          lessening your spiritual strength. You should hold your peace from complaining, and take your burden to Jesus,
          and lay your whole soul open before Him. Do not carry it to a third person. Do not lay your burden upon
          humanity. Say, “I will not gratify the enemy by murmuring. I will lay my care at the feet of Jesus. I will
          tell it to Him in faith.” If you do this you will receive help from above; you will realize the fulﬁllment of
          the promise, “He is on my right hand that I should not be moved” (see Psalm 16:8).<span

      <p>God’s Word declares, “Many shall be puriﬁed, and made white, and tried” (Daniel 12:10). Only he who endures the
          trial will receive the crown of life.<span class="ft15">5</span></p>
