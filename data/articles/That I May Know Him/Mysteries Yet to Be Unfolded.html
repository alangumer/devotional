    <h1>Mysteries Yet to Be Unfolded</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world
          hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ. Ephesians 3:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Many have endeavored to deﬁne the mystery which Paul here mentions. But it embraces much, and our ideas in
          regard to the love, the goodness, and the compassion of God are strangely limited. Because our knowledge of
          spiritual things has become so dwarfed and enfeebled, we have not advanced from light to greater light. The
          Lord has not been able to open to our understanding many precious things. In view of the losses which we have
          sustained by our earthliness and commonness we have much to make us humble....</p>
      <p>Since the promise given in Eden, God has revealed His mysteries through His prophets.... But many
          mysteries</p>
      <p>yet remain unrevealed. How much that is acknowledged to be truth is mysterious and unexplainable to the human
          mind! How dark seem the dispensations of Providence! What necessity there is for implicit faith and trust in
          God’s moral government! ... “How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past ﬁnding out!” (Romans
          11:33).</p>
      <p>We are not now sufﬁciently advanced in spiritual attainments to comprehend the mysteries of God. But when we
          shall compose the family of heaven, these mysteries will be unfolded before us....</p>
      <p>Then much will be revealed in explanation of matters upon which God now keeps silence because we have not
          gathered up and appreciated that which has been made known of the eternal mysteries. The ways of Providence
          will be made clear; the mysteries of grace through Christ will be unfolded. That which the mind cannot now
          grasp, which is hard to be understood, will be explained. We shall see order in that which has seemed
          unexplainable, wisdom in everything withheld, goodness and gracious mercy in everything imparted. Truth will
          be unfolded to the mind, free from obscurity, in a single line, and its brightness will be endurable. The
          heart will be made to sing for joy. Controversies will be forever ended, and all difﬁculties will be
          solved.<span class="ft17">31</span></p>
