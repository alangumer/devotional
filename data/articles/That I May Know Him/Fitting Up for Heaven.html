    <h1>Fitting Up for Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called
          their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. Hebrews 11:16.</strong></p>
      <p>We profess to be pilgrims and strangers on earth, journeying to a better country, even an heavenly. If we are
          indeed but sojourners here, traveling to a land where none but the holy can dwell, we shall make it our ﬁrst
          business to become acquainted with that country; we shall make diligent inquiry as to the preparation needed,
          the manners and character which we must have in order to become citizens there. Jesus, the King of that land,
          is pure and holy. He has commanded His followers, “Be ye holy; for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). If we are
          hereafter to associate with Christ and sinless angels we must here obtain a ﬁtness for such society.</p>
      <p>This is our <nobr>work—our</nobr><nobr>all-important</nobr> work. Every other consideration is of minor
          consequence. Our conversation, our deportment, our every act, should be such as to convince our family, our
          neighbors, and the world that we expect soon to remove to a better country.... Those whose faith is daily
          conﬁrmed and strengthened</p>
      <p>by their works will become acquainted with <nobr>self-denial</nobr> in restricting appetite, controlling
          ambitious desires, bringing every thought and feeling into harmony with the divine will....</p>
      <p>The land to which we are traveling is in every sense far more attractive than was the land of Canaan to the
          children of Israel.... What stayed their progress just in sight of the goodly land?.... It was their own
          willful</p>
      <p>unbelief that turned them back. They were unwilling to risk anything upon the promises of God.... The history
          of</p>
      <p>the children of Israel is written as a warning to us “upon whom the ends of the world are come.” We are
          standing, as it were, upon the very borders of the heavenly Canaan. We may, if we will, look over on the other
          side and behold the attractions of the goodly land. If we have faith in the promises of God we shall show in
          conversation and in deportment that we are not living for this world, but are making it our ﬁrst business to
          prepare for that holy land.<span class="ft11">18</span></p>
