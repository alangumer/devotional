      <p><strong>Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Psalm
          37:3.</strong></p>
      <p>“Trust in the Lord.” Each day has its burdens, its cares and perplexities, and when we meet, how ready we are
          to talk of our difﬁculties and trials.... Some are always fearing and borrowing trouble. Every day they
          are</p>
      <p>surrounded by the tokens of God’s love, every day they are enjoying the bounties of His providence, but they
          overlook these present blessings....</p>
      <p>Why should we be ungrateful and distrustful? Jesus is our friend. All heaven is interested in our welfare, and
          our anxiety and fear grieve the Holy Spirit of God. We should not indulge in a solicitude which only frets and
          wears us but does not help us to bear trials. No place should be given to that distrust of God which leads us
          to make a preparation against future want the chief pursuit of life, as though our happiness consisted in
          these earthly things....</p>
      <p>You may be perplexed in business; your prospects may grow darker and darker and you may be threatened with
          loss. But do not become discouraged; cast your care upon God and remain calm and cheerful. Begin every day
          with earnest prayer, not omitting to offer praise and thanksgiving. Ask for wisdom to manage your affairs with
          discretion and thus prevent loss and disaster. Do all you can on your part to bring about favorable
          results....</p>
      <p>When, relying upon your tried Helper, you have done all you can, accept the result cheerfully. It will not
          always be gain from the worldling’s standpoint, but perhaps success might have been the worst thing for
          you....</p>
      <p>We want an eye single to the glory of God in all the affairs of life; we want a living faith that holds fast
          the promises of God no matter how dark the prospect. We are not to look at the things which are seen, and
          judge from the world’s standpoint, and be ruled by the world’s principles, but we are to look at the things
          which are unseen, eternal.<span class="ft11">19</span></p>
