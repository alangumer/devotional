    <h1>The Holy Spirit Our Helper</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Romans 8:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Through the ministry of the angels the Holy Spirit is enabled to work upon the mind and heart of the human
          agent and draw him to Christ.... But the Spirit of God does not interfere with the freedom of the human
          agent.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is given to be a helper, so that man may cooperate with the Divine, and it is given to Him to
          draw the soul but never to force obedience.</p>
      <p>Christ is ready to impart all heavenly inﬂuences. He knows every temptation that comes to man, and the
          capabilities of each. He weighs his strength. He sees the present and the future, and presents before the mind
          the obligations that should be met, and urges that common, earthly things shall not be permitted to be so
          absorbing that eternal things shall be lost out of the reckoning. The Lord has fullness of grace to bestow on
          every one that will receive of the heavenly gift. The Holy Spirit will bring the <nobr>God-entrusted</nobr>
          capabilities into Christ’s service, and will mold and fashion the human agent according to the divine
          Pattern.<span class="ft17">24</span></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is our efﬁciency in the work of character building, in forming characters after the divine
          similitude. When we think ourselves capable of molding our own experience, we make a great mistake. We can
          never of ourselves obtain the victory over temptation. But those who have genuine faith in Christ will be
          worked by the Holy Spirit. The soul in whose heart faith abides will grow into a beautiful temple for the
          Lord. He is directed by the grace of Christ. Just in proportion as he depends on the Holy Spirit’s teaching he
          will grow.<span class="ft22">25</span></p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. We do not now see Christ and speak to Him,
          but His Holy Spirit is just as near us in one place as another. It works in and through every one who receives
          Christ. Those who know the indwelling of the Spirit reveal the fruit of the <nobr>Spirit—love,</nobr> joy,
          peace, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, goodness, faith.<span class="ft15">26</span></p>
