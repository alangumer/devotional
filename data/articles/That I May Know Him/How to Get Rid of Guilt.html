    <h1>How to Get Rid of Guilt</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant
          of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. Micah
          7:18.</strong></p>
      <p>I am glad indeed that our feelings are no evidence that we are not children of God. The enemy will tempt you to
          think that you have done things that have separated you from God, and that He no longer loves you, but our
          Lord loves us still....</p>
      <p>Look away from yourself to the perfection of Christ. We cannot manufacture a righteousness for ourselves.
          Christ has in His hands the pure robes of righteousness, and He will put them upon us. He will speak sweet
          words of forgiveness and promise. He presents to our thirsty souls fountains of living water whereby we may be
          refreshed. He bids us come unto Him with all our burdens, all our griefs, and He says we shall ﬁnd
          rest....</p>
      <p>Jesus sees the guilt of the past, and speaks pardon, and we must not dishonor Him by doubting His love. This
          feeling of guiltiness must be laid at the foot of the cross of Calvary. The sense of sinfulness has poisoned
          the springs of life and of true happiness. Now Jesus says, “Lay it all on Me. I will take your sins; I will
          give you peace. Banish no longer your <nobr>self-respect,</nobr> for I have bought you with the price of My
          own blood. You are Mine. Your weakened will I will strengthen; your remorse for sin I will remove.” Then turn
          your grateful heart, trembling with uncertainty, to Him and lay hold on the hope set before you. God accepts
          your broken, contrite heart, and extends to you free pardon. He offers to adopt you into His family, with His
          grace to help your weakness, and the dear Saviour will lead you on step by step, you placing your hand in His
          and letting Him guide you.</p>
      <p>Search for the precious promises of God. If Satan thrusts threatenings before your mind, turn from them and
          cling to the promises, and let your soul be comforted by their brightness. The cloud is dark in itself, but
          when ﬁlled with the light it is turned to the brightness of gold, for the glory of God is upon it.<span
