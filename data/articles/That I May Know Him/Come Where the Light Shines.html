    <h1>Come Where the Light Shines</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one
          another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. Hebrews 10:25.</strong></p>
      <p>It is no small matter for a family in an unbelieving community to stand as representatives for Jesus, keeping
          God’s law. We are required to be living epistles, known and read of all men. This position involves fearful
          responsibilities. In order to live in the light we must come where the light shines. It is not well for the
          people of God to lose the privilege of associating with those of like faith with themselves, for the truth
          loses its importance in their minds.... They are not strengthened by the words of the living preacher....</p>
      <p>The faith of most Christians will waver if they constantly neglect to meet together for conference and prayer.
          If it were impossible for them to enjoy such religious privileges, then God would send light direct from
          heaven by His angels, to animate, to cheer, and to bless His scattered people. But He does not propose to work
          a miracle to sustain the faith of His children. They are required to love the truth enough to make some effort
          to secure the privileges and blessings vouchsafed them of God....</p>
      <p>“Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of
          remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they
          shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
          spareth his own son that serveth him” (Malachi 3:16, 17).</p>
      <p>It will pay, then, to improve the privileges within our reach, and even at some sacriﬁce to assemble with those
          who fear God and speak for Him. For He is represented as hearkening to those testimonies, while angels write
          them in a book. God will remember those who have met together and thought upon His name.... They will be
          as</p>
      <p>precious jewels in His sight when His wrath shall fall on the shelterless head of the sinner.<span
