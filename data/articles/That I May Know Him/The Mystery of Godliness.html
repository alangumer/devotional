    <h1>The Mystery of Godliness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
          give us all things?. Romans 8:32.</strong></p>
      <p>Before this wonderful, priceless gift was bestowed, the whole heavenly universe was mightily stirred in an
          effort to understand God’s unfathomable love, stirred to awaken in human hearts a gratitude proportionate to
          the value of the gift. Shall we for whom Christ has given His life, halt between two opinions? Shall we give
          God only a mite of the powers of our nature? Shall we return only a part of the capabilities and powers lent
          us by God? Can we do this while we know that He who was Commander of all heaven ... , realizing the
          helplessness of the human race, came to this earth in human nature to make it possible for us to unite our
          humanity to His divinity?</p>
      <p>He became poor that we might come into possession of the heavenly treasure, a far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory. To rescue the fallen race, He descended from one humiliation to another, until He, the
          <nobr>divine-human</nobr> suffering Christ, was uplifted on the cross, to draw all men unto Him. The Son of
          God could not have shown greater condescension than He did; He could not have stooped lower.</p>
      <p>This is the mystery of godliness, the mystery which has inspired heavenly agencies so to minister through
          fallen humanity that in the world an interest will be aroused in the plan of salvation. This is the mystery
          that has stirred all heaven to unite with man in carrying out God’s great plan for the salvation of a ruined
          world, that men and women may be led, by the signs in the heavens and in the earth, to prepare for the second
          coming of our Lord....</p>
      <p>As the Head of the church Christ is authoritatively calling upon every person who claims to believe on Him to
          follow His example of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce....</nobr> They are called upon to
          rally without delay under the</p>
      <p><nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Christ Jesus. Withholding nothing, they are to make an entire offering for
          the attainment of eternal, measureless <nobr>results—the</nobr> salvation of souls.<span
