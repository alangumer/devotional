    <h1>Have You Enrolled?</h1>

      <p><strong>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. Proverbs 23:26.</strong></p>
      <p>Dear youth, the very best thing you can do is to enlist freely and decidedly in the army of the Lord. Surrender
          yourself into the hands of God, that your will and ways may be guided by the One who is unerring in wisdom and
          inﬁnite in goodness. To withhold yourself from God is to rob God of that which is His own. The Lord hath need
          of you, and you have need of the Lord. It is not safe for you to put off the decisive step, or delay the
          matter of making a complete surrender of yourself to God. If you have not already given yourself to God, I
          beseech you to do it now. Let your name be enrolled in the heavenly records as one of the chosen and elect of
          God....</p>
      <p>“God so loved the world, the he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
          but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).... It is through the inestimable gift of Christ that all our
          blessings</p>
      <p>come. Life, health, friends, reason, happiness, are ours through the merit of Christ. O that the young and the
          old might realize that all comes to them through the virtue of Christ’s life and death, and acknowledge the
          ownership of God....</p>
      <p>Even when we were under the control of a cruel master, even when the prince of darkness ruled our spirits, the
          Lord Jesus Christ paid the ransom price of His own blood for us. You have been bought with a price, even with
          the precious blood of Christ; you are His property, therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
          which are God’s....</p>
      <p>Were it not for the love freely given us of Christ, we should now be in hopeless despair, in spiritual
          midnight. Thank God every day that He gave us Jesus. Will you not accept His gift? Will you not be His
          witness? Time is short, and it becomes you to work while the day lasts, living an imperishable life, hiding
          your life with Christ in God. Then “when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with
          him in glory” (Colossians 3:4).<span class="ft11">29</span></p>
