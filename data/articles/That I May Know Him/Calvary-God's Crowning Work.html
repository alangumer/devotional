    <h1>Calvary—God’s Crowning Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation
          for our sins. 1 John 4:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The love of God was Christ’s theme when speaking of His mission and His work. “Therefore doth my Father love
          me,” He says, “because I lay down my life, that I might take it again” (John 10:17). My Father loves you with
          a love so unbounded that He loves Me the more because I have given My life to redeem you. He loves you, and He
          loves Me more because I love you, and give My life for you.... Well did the disciples understand</p>
      <p>this love as they saw their Saviour enduring shame, reproach, doubt, and betrayal, as they saw His agony in the
          Garden, and His death on Calvary’s cross. This is a love the depth of which no sounding can ever fathom. As
          the disciples comprehended it, as their perception took hold of God’s divine compassion, they realized that
          there is a sense in which the sufferings of the Son were the sufferings of the Father....</p>
      <p>When our Redeemer consented to take the cup of suffering in order to save sinners, His capacity for suffering
          was the only limitation to His suffering.... By dying in our behalf, He gave an equivalent for our debt. Thus
          He</p>
      <p>removed from God all charge of lessening the guilt of sin. By virtue of My oneness with the Father, He says, My
          suffering and death enable Me to pay the penalty of sin. By My death a restraint is removed from His love. His
          grace can act with unbounded efﬁciency.<span class="ft11">4</span></p>
      <p>Christ is our Redeemer. He is the Word that became ﬂesh and dwelt among us. He is the fountain in which we may
          be washed and cleansed from all impurity. He is the costly sacriﬁce that has been given for the reconciliation
          of man. The universe of heaven, the worlds unfallen, the fallen world, and the confederacy of evil cannot say
          that God could do more for the salvation of man than He has done. Never can His gift be surpassed, never can
          He display a richer depth of love. Calvary represents His crowning work. It is man’s part to respond to His
          great love by appropriating the great salvation the blessing of the Lord has made it possible for man to
          obtain.<span class="ft22">5</span></p>
