    <h1>“Come Ye Yourselves Apart”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.
          Psalm 27:14.</strong></p>
      <p>No other life was ever so crowded with labor and responsibility as was that of Jesus, yet how often He was
          found in prayer! How constant was His communion with God! ... As one with us, a sharer in our needs and
          weaknesses, He was wholly dependent upon God, and in the secret place of prayer He sought divine strength that
          He might go forth braced for duty and trial. In a world of sin Jesus endured struggles and torture of soul. In
          communion with God He could unburden the sorrows that were crushing Him....</p>
      <p>In Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of inﬁnite pity. As a man He supplicated the throne of God
          till His humanity was charged with a heavenly current that should connect humanity with divinity. Through
          continual communion He received life from God, that He might impart life to the world. His experience is to be
          ours. “Come ye yourselves apart” (Mark 6:31), He bids us. If we would give heed to His Word we should be
          stronger and more useful.... If today we would take time to go to Jesus and tell Him our needs we should not
          be</p>
      <p>disappointed; He would be at our right hand to help us....</p>
      <p>In all who are under the training of God is to be revealed a life that is not in harmony with the world, its
          customs, or its practices, and everyone needs to have a personal experience in obtaining a knowledge of the
          will of God. We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in
          quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, “Be
          still, and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10). Here alone can true rest be found. And this is the effectual
          preparation for all who labor for God. Amid the hurrying throng and the strain of life’s intense activities,
          the soul that is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. The life will
          breathe out fragrance and will reveal a divine power that will reach men’s hearts.<span
