    <h1>“Wounded for Our Transgressions”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
          God, and afﬂicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the
          chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. Isaiah 53:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>The sincere Christian may indeed grieve as he sees the havoc sin has wrought, but only in a limited sense can
          the human agent comprehend the sadness of Christ as He looks upon sin as it exists in the human heart....</p>
      <p>From the light of His exalted purity the world’s Redeemer could see that the maladies from which the human
          family were suffering were brought upon them by transgression of the law of God. Every case of suffering He
          could trace back to its cause. He read the sad and awful history of the ﬁnal end of unrepenting sinners. He
          knew that He alone could rescue them from the pit into which they had fallen. He alone could place their feet
          in the right path. His perfection alone could avail for their imperfection. He alone could cover their
          nakedness with His own spotless robe of righteousness.</p>
      <p>Christ wanted all. He could not endure that one should be lost. O if the human family could only see the
          results of sin in the transgression and violence and crime that exist in the world! If they could see the
          transformation of men from the image of God to the similitude of Satan! Man was created pure and holy, but
          through transgression he came to possess the attributes of Satan....</p>
      <p>In coming to the world in human form, in becoming subject to the law, in revealing to men that He bore their
          sickness, their sorrow, their guilt, Christ did not become a sinner. He was pure and uncontaminated by any
          disease. Not one stain of sin was found upon Him.... He stood before the world the spotless Lamb of God.
          When</p>
      <p>suffering humanity pressed about Him, He who was in the health of perfect manhood was as one afﬂicted with
          them. This was essential, that He might express His perfect love in behalf of humanity.... Christ was strong
          to</p>
      <p>save the whole world.<span class="ft15">2</span></p>
