    <h1>An Attribute We May Share</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Luke 6:36.</strong></p>
      <p>Mercy is an attribute that the human agent may share with God, thus cooperating with Him. Mercy is kind,
          pitiful. Mercy and the love of God purify the soul and beautify the heart, cleansing the life from
          selﬁshness....</p>
      <p>God’s love for the angelic host is as a part of Himself, direct and positive in its divinity. God’s love for
          the human race is a peculiar <nobr>form—a</nobr> love born of mercy, for the human subject is
          <nobr>all-undeserving....</nobr></p>
      <p>Mercy implies the imperfection of the object upon which it is bestowed. Because of man’s imperfection, mercy
          was brought into active existence. Sin is not the object of God’s love, but of His hatred. Yet He pities the
          sinner, because the guilty one bears the Creator’s image and has received from Him the capabilities that make
          it possible for him to become a son of God, not through his own merits, but through the imputed merits of
          Jesus Christ, through the great sacriﬁce the Saviour has made in his behalf....</p>
      <p>In the church militant the children of men will be ever in need of restoration from the results of sin....
          We</p>
      <p>are all dependent on one another. Almost invariably a man who is superior to another man in some respect is
          inferior to him in other respects. Every human being on earth is subject to temptation. And all are in need of
          human inﬂuence and sympathy.... He who cooperates with God by showing mercy brings himself into a
          position</p>
      <p>where God will extend mercy to him, for he is in harmony with the divine attributes.</p>
      <p>God’s love and mercy are ever extended toward sinners. Shall men who themselves have sinned against God, refuse
          to forgive and accept a repentant sinner? ... God loved us while we were yet sinners. How clear and
          unmistakable the line of duty is made by the words, “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
          likewise” (Luke 6:31).... Only those who walk with Christ can be truly merciful.<span
