    <h1>Will You Let Him In?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love:
          therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. Jeremiah 31:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The work dearest to the heart of Christ is that of drawing souls to Him.... Look at Jesus, the Majesty of</p>
      <p>heaven. [From a personal letter of appeal.] What do you behold in His life history? His divinity clothed with
          humanity, a whole life of continual humility, the doing of one act of condescension after another, a line of
          continual descent from the heavenly courts to a world all seared and marred with the curse, and in a world
          unworthy of His presence, descending lower and still lower, taking the form of a servant, to be despised and
          rejected of men, obliged to ﬂee from place to place to save His life, and at last betrayed, rejected,
          cruciﬁed. Then, as sinners for whom Jesus suffered more than the power of mortal can portray, shall we refuse
          to humble our proud will?</p>
      <p>Study day and night the character of Christ. It was His tender compassion, His inexpressible, unparalleled love
          for your soul, that led Him to endure all the shame, the revilings, the abuse, the misapprehensions of earth.
          Approach nearer Him, behold His hands and His feet, bruised and wounded for our transgressions. “The
          chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”</p>
      <p>Lose no time, let not another day pass into eternity, but just as you are, whatever your weakness, your
          unworthiness, your neglect, delay not to come now.... The call of Jesus to come to Him, the presentation of
          a</p>
      <p>crown of glory that fadeth not away, the life, the eternal life that measures with the life of God, has not
          been of sufﬁcient inducement to lead you to serve Him with your undivided affections....</p>
      <p>Be no longer on Satan’s side of the question. Make decided, radical changes through the grace given you of God.
          No longer insult His grace. He is saying with tears, “Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life” (John
          5:40). Now Jesus is inviting you, knocking at the door of your heart for entrance. Will you let Him come
          in?<span class="ft19">23</span></p>
