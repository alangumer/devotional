    <h1>A Jubilee for Jesus?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long. Psalm 35:28. While I
          was in England, one day there was a great parade in the streets. It was the Queen’s Jubilee.
          Everyone</strong></p>
      <p>was talking about it. The shop windows were ﬁlled with her pictures, and all were extolling the queen of
          England. Could we have taken from the shop windows the pictures of the queen and the signs of her glory, and
          placed instead expressions of the glory and majesty of Jesus, would not the people have regarded us as
          religious fanatics? They would have thought that we were carrying religion too far.... But did not our Master
          lay aside His</p>
      <p>royal robes, His crown of glory? Did He not clothe His divinity with humanity, and come to our world to die
          man’s sacriﬁce? Why should we not talk about it? Why should we not dwell on His matchless love?</p>
      <p>O that our tongues might lose their paralysis, that we might speak forth His praise! O that the spiritual
          torpor which has come upon the souls of men might be removed, that we might discern the glory of God in the
          face of Jesus Christ! We are to be the representatives of our Lord upon earth.... He can communicate heaven’s
          light</p>
      <p>through you to those who sit in darkness. You that have claimed to know the Lord, you who profess to have
          tasted and seen that the Lord is good, reveal it to those around you. Show forth the praises of Him who has
          called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. If men can make so much ado over the Queen’s Jubilee, if
          they can manifest so much enthusiasm over a ﬁnite being, can we not speak to the glory of the Prince of Life,
          who is so soon to come in majesty to take His weary, worn followers to Himself; to unlock the prison bars of
          death, and set the captives free; to give His loved ones who sleep, a glorious immortality? Why cannot Christ
          be introduced into our conversation? We are almost home. Let us speak courage to the weary soldiers of the
          cross.... Let us</p>
      <p>tell the pilgrims and strangers of earth that we shall soon reach a better country, even a heavenly.<span
