    <h1>Robed in His Perfection</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have conﬁdence, and not be
          ashamed before him at his coming. 1 John 2:28.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus came into the world to save sinners, not in their sins but from their sins, and to sanctify them through
          the truth; and in order that He may become a perfect Saviour to us, we must enter into union with Him by a
          personal act of faith. Christ has chosen us, we have chosen Him, and by this choice we become united to Him
          and are to live from henceforth, not unto ourselves, but unto Him who has died for us. But this union can only
          be preserved by constant watchfulness, lest we fall into temptation and make a different choice, for we are
          free always to take another master if we so desire. Union with Christ means an unfailing preference for Him in
          every act and thought....</p>
      <p>We are to consider ourselves as constituting the family of Christ, and we are to follow Him as dear children.
          Adopted into the household of God, shall we not honor our Father and our kindred? ...</p>
      <p>We must establish an unyielding enmity between our souls and our foe, but we must open our hearts to the power
          and inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit. We want Satan’s darkness to be shut out and the light of Heaven to ﬂow in. We
          want to become so sensitive to holy inﬂuences that the lightest whisper of Jesus will move our souls....</p>
      <p>Then we shall delight to do the will of God, and Christ can own us before the Father and before the holy angels
          as those who abide in Him....</p>
      <p>But we shall not boast of our holiness. As we have clearer views of Christ’s spotless and inﬁnite purity we
          shall feel as did Daniel when he beheld the glory of the Lord and said, “My comeliness was turned in me into
          corruption” (Daniel 10:8). We cannot say, “I am sinless” till this vile body is changed and fashioned like
          unto His glorious body. But if we constantly seek to follow Jesus, the blessed hope is ours of standing before
          the throne of God without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, complete in Christ, robed in His righteousness
          and perfection.<span class="ft11">24</span></p>
