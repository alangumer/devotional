    <h1>Evidence of Our Allegiance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye love me, keep my commandments. John 14:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Let this point be fully settled in every mind: If we accept Christ as a Redeemer we must accept Him as a Ruler.
          We cannot have the assurance, the perfect, conﬁding trust in Christ as our Saviour, until we acknowledge Him
          and are obedient to His commandments. Thus we evidence our allegiance to God. We have then the genuine ring in
          our faith. It works by love. Speak it from your heart: “Lord, I believe Thou hast died to redeem my soul. If
          Thou hast placed such a value upon my soul as to give Thy life for mine, I give my life and all its
          possibilities in all my weakness into Thy keeping.” The will must be brought into complete harmony with the
          will of God.<span class="ft22">16</span></p>
      <p>Today the invitation is given: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
          Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your
          souls” (Matthew 11:28, 29). Christ has rest for all who will wear His yoke and learn His meekness and
          lowliness of heart. Here we are taught restraint and obedience, and in this we shall ﬁnd rest. Thank God that
          in humility and obedience we shall ﬁnd just that which we all need so <nobr>much—the</nobr> rest that is found
          in faith and conﬁdence and perfect trust. We must not manufacture an oppressive yoke for our necks. Let us
          take the yoke of Christ and in entire obedience draw with Him....</p>
      <p>“If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide
          in his love” (John 15:10). This is the yoke which Christ invites us to <nobr>wear—the</nobr> yoke of
          obedience. Can we not say, “Lord, I take Thee at Thy word; I receive Thy promise. I come to Thee because I
          need Thee as a personal Saviour. I must have an abiding Christ. I am dependent on Thee. Thou art mine.” Christ
          says, “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth <nobr>them”—not</nobr> in pretense, but with the whole mind,
          heart, soul, and <nobr>strength—“he</nobr> it is that loveth me” (John 14:21). This is the true test of
          character. We must be doers of the Word.<span class="ft11">17</span></p>
