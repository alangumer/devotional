    <h1>Bearer of Our Afﬂictions</h1>

      <p><strong>That it might be fulﬁlled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our inﬁrmities,
          and bare our sicknesses. Matthew 8:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ alone was able to bear the afﬂictions of the many. “In all their afﬂiction he was afﬂicted” (Isaiah
          63:9). He never bore disease in His own ﬂesh, but He carried the sickness of others. With tenderest sympathy
          He looked upon the suffering ones who pressed about Him. He groaned in spirit as He saw the work of Satan
          revealed in all their woe, and He made every case of need and of sorrow His own. No multiplicity of numbers
          distracted Him. No anguish overwhelmed Him. With a power that never quailed He cast out the evil spirits that
          possessed mind and body, while the pain of the sufferers thrilled through His whole being. The power of love
          was in all His healing. He identiﬁed His interests with suffering humanity.</p>
      <p>Christ was health and strength in Himself, and when sufferers were in His immediate presence, disease was
          always rebuked. It was for this reason that He did not go at once to Lazarus. He could not witness his
          suffering and not bring him relief. He could not witness disease or death without combating the power of
          Satan. The death of Lazarus was permitted that through his resurrection the last and crowning evidence might
          be given to the Jews that Jesus was the Son of God.</p>
      <p>And in all this conﬂict with the power of evil there was ever before Christ the darkened shadow into which He
          Himself must enter. Ever before Him was the means by which He must pay the ransom for these souls....</p>
      <p>When He raised Lazarus from the dead He knew that for that life He must pay the ransom on the cross of Calvary.
          Every rescue made was to cause Him the deepest humiliation. He was to taste death for every man.... Of
          the</p>
      <p>suffering multitudes brought to Christ it is said, “He healed them all” (Matthew 12:15). Thus He expressed His
          love for the children of men. His miracles were part of His mission.... He knows how to speak the word
          “Be</p>
      <p>whole,” and when He has healed the sufferer He says, “Go and sin no more.”<span class="ft15">15</span></p>
