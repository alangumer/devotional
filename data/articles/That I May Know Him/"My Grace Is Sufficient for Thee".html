      <p><strong>And he said unto me, My grace is sufﬁcient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most
          gladly therefore will I rather glory in my inﬁrmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2
          Corinthians 12:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Through all my sickness the last eight months, [Written during Ellen White’s long illness in Australia.] I have
          had during my sleepless hours the most precious contemplations of the love of God to man, expressed in the
          wonderful sacriﬁce made to save him from ruin. I loved to repeat the name of Jesus; how full of sweetness,
          light, and love it is! Looking upon the cross, at the humiliations and sufferings endured in bearing our sins,
          that His righteousness might be imputed to us, softens the heart and ﬁlls the soul with His love....</p>
      <p>When pain has seemed to be almost unbearable, I have looked to Jesus and prayed most earnestly, and He has been
          beside me, and the darkness has passed away and all has seemed light. The very air seemed like precious
          fragrance. How glorious seemed the truth! How uplifting! I could rest in the love of Jesus. Pain was still my
          portion, but the promise, “My grace is sufﬁcient for thee,” was enough to give me comfort. The sharpest pains
          seemed to be converted into peace and rest. For hours in the night season I have had sweet communion with God.
          My mind seemed to be illuminated. I had no disposition to murmur or complain.</p>
      <p>Jesus was the spring of my hope and my joy and courage. Heaven has seemed to be very near, and Christ the great
          Physician, my restorer, the remedy of all sickness. In Him all fullness dwells. Jesus is music to my ears, and
          although drinking the cup of suffering, the water of life was presented to me to quench my thirst. Christ is
          our righteousness, our sanctiﬁcation, our redemption. Through these months of suffering I have had such
          precious views of the goodness of Jesus that I want them never to become dim. I believe now that my sickness
          in this strange country is a part of God’s plan.... How urgently my soul pleads for the heavenly endowment.

      <p>myself I can do nothing. The power and the glory is all of God.<span class="ft15">6</span></p>
