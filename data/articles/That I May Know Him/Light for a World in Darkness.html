    <h1>Light for a World in Darkness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall
          arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to
          the brightness of thy rising. Isaiah 60:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>Darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, and how ardently we should desire the presence of the
          divine Instructor to lead us in the way of truth and righteousness. God has already spoken to man at sundry
          times and in divers places and in various ways, yet the world’s ignorance is increasing. We must speak with
          more pronounced utterances concerning the truth, that we may bring to man a knowledge of God. The distinction
          between Christians and worldlings must be more marked. The Bible must become a book of more prominence among
          us, and the attentive, diligent searcher by painstaking effort must search for the hidden treasure. The maxims
          of men, the dogmas of error, though advanced by those who profess to be interpreters of the Word of God, must
          be discarded, for they are calculated to cover up the truth....</p>
      <p>The Jews turned from the Lord Jesus, whom the prophets foretold as the coming Messiah, and they have not been
          able to see to the end of that which was abolished. In making void the law of God, in turning from the truth
          with aversion, the Christian world have turned from Christ, and have made manifest the fact that they were not
          accustomed to looking upon truth of heavenly origin. The darkness has become like a funeral pall, and it
          covers the whole earth. This is not the time to become weak and sickly in faith. This is no time to permit the
          world to convert the church of God. Let those who have light now arise and shine....</p>
      <p>Those who are waiting for the appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ cannot mingle with those who are
          lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, who are seeking amusement in games and pleasure parties. As
          faithful watchmen they must proclaim the warning, “The morning cometh, and also the night” (Isaiah
          21:12).<span class="ft22">3</span></p>
