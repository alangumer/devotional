    <h1>The Peril of Neglect</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do
          these things, ye shall never fall. 2 Peter 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The world’s Redeemer has said, “Search the scriptures” (John 5:39). In them is laid open the bounteous
          provisions for human necessities, and the strongest motives are set forth to inﬂuence to repentance and
          obedience. Here the seeker for truth may read, contemplate, and be stirred to the very depths of his being by
          that which a good and gracious God has done and is continually doing for him. He will be amazed that he should
          ever have treated with indifference the marvelous love and pardon proffered, for in redeeming man, God gave
          the greatest gift that He could offer. And if the objects of so great a love neglect salvation, there is
          nothing that Heaven can do more in their behalf....</p>
      <p>You need to study, to contemplate these great themes, lest you cherish indifference and become too hardened to
          yield to the conditions of the wonderful plan of salvation, and too proud to be humbled by a realization of
          your own fallen condition....</p>
      <p>The Lord enjoins upon children and youth to search for truth as for hidden treasure, and to be attracted and
          fascinated by that which unites the human with the divine.... Well may the apostle ask, “How shall we escape,
          if</p>
      <p>we neglect so great salvation?” (Hebrews 2:3)....</p>
      <p>The power of an angel could not make an atonement for our sins. The angelic nature united to the human could
          not be as costly, as elevated, as the law of God. It was the Son of God alone who could present an acceptable
          sacriﬁce. God Himself became man and bore all the wrath that sin had provoked. This <nobr>problem—How</nobr>
          could God be just and yet the justiﬁer of <nobr>sinners?—bafﬂed</nobr> all ﬁnite intelligence. A divine person
          alone could mediate between God and man. Human redemption is a theme which may well tax the faculties of the
          mind to the utmost....</p>
      <p>We cannot say to the youth or those of mature age, You have nothing to do yourself in this great work. We urge
          to constant effort. You must be diligent to make your calling and election sure.<span
