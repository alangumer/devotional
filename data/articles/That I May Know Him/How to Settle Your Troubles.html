    <h1>How to Settle Your Troubles</h1>

      <p><strong>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
          alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Matthew 18:15.</strong></p>
      <p>We should carefully consider what is our relation to God and to one another. We are continually sinning against
          God, but His mercy still follows us; in love He bears with our perversities, our neglect, our ingratitude, our
          disobedience. He never becomes impatient with us. We insult His mercy, grieve His Holy Spirit, and do Him
          dishonor before men and angels, and yet His compassions fail not. The thought of God’s
          <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> to us should make us forbearing to one another. How patiently should we bear with
          the faults and errors of our brethren when we remember how great are our own failings in the sight of God. How
          can we pray to our heavenly Father, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors” (Matthew 6:12) if we are
          ... exacting in our treatment of others? ...</p>
      <p>If you think your brother has injured you, go to him in kindness and love, and you may come to an understanding
          and to reconciliation.... If you succeed in settling the trouble you have gained your brother</p>
      <p>without exposing his frailties, and the settlement between you has been the covering of a multitude of sins
          from the observation of others....</p>
      <p>It takes special watchfulness to keep the affections alive and our hearts in a condition where we shall be
          sensible of the good that exists in the hearts of others. If we do not watch on this point, Satan will put his
          jealousy into our souls; he will put his glasses before our eyes, that we may see the actions of our brethren
          in a distorted light. Instead of looking critically upon our brethren we should turn our eyes within, and be
          ready to discover the objectionable traits of our own character. As we have a proper realization of our own
          mistakes and failures, the mistakes of others will sink into insigniﬁcance.</p>
      <p>Satan is an accuser of the brethren. He is on the watch for every error, no matter how small, that he may have
          something on which to found an accusation. Keep off from Satan’s side.<span class="ft15">32</span></p>
