    <h1>Wonderful Simplicity of the Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the
          simple. Psalm 19:7.</strong></p>
      <p>How wonderful in its simplicity, its comprehensiveness and perfection, is the law of Jehovah! In the purposes
          and dealings of God there are mysteries which the ﬁnite mind is unable to comprehend....</p>
      <p>But there is no mystery in the law of God. The feeblest intellect can grasp these rules to regulate the life
          and form the character after the divine Model. If the children of men would to the best of their ability obey
          this law, they would gain strength of intellect and power of discernment to comprehend still more of God’s
          purposes and plans....</p>
      <p>The inﬁnite sacriﬁce which Christ has made to magnify and exalt the law testiﬁes that not one jot or tittle of
          that law will relinquish its claims upon the transgressor. Christ came to pay the debt which the sinner had
          incurred by transgression and by His own example to teach man how to keep the law of God. Said Christ, “I have
          kept my Father’s commandments” (John 15:10).... It is inconceivable how so many, professing to be servants
          of</p>
      <p>God, can set aside His law and teach sinners that they are not amenable to its precepts. What a fatal
          delusion!....</p>
      <p>We are living in a land of bondage and of death. Multitudes are enslaved by sinful customs and evil habits, and
          their fetters are difﬁcult to break. Iniquity, like a ﬂood, is deluging the earth. Crimes almost too fearful
          to be even mentioned are of daily occurrence. Shall we say that all this is because men live in obedience to
          the will of God, or is it because ministers and people hold and teach that its precepts have no binding
          force?<span class="ft17">18</span></p>
      <p>“God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son” that the lost might be reclaimed.... He who</p>
      <p>has tasted and found that the Lord is good cannot bear the thought of following in the path of transgression.
          It is pain to him to violate the law of that God who has so loved him.<span class="ft15">19</span></p>
