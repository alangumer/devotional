    <h1>First Things First</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things
          which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan has worked continually to eclipse the glories of the future world, and to attract the whole attention to
          the things of this life. He has striven so to arrange matters that our thought, our anxiety, our labor, might
          be so fully employed in temporal things that we should not see or realize the value of eternal realities. The
          world and its cares have too large a place, while Jesus and heavenly things have altogether too small a share
          in our thoughts and affections. We should conscientiously discharge all the duties of everyday life, but it is
          also essential that we should cultivate above everything else, holy affection for our Lord Jesus Christ.<span

      <p>Views of heavenly things do not incapacitate men and women for the duties of this life, but rather render them
          more efﬁcient and faithful. Although the grand realities of the eternal world seem to charm the mind, engross
          the attention, and enrapture the whole being, yet with spiritual enlightenment there comes a calm,
          <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> diligence that enables the Christian to take pleasure in the performance of the
          commonplace duties of life....</p>
      <p>The contemplation of the love of God manifested in the gift of His Son for the salvation of fallen men will
          stir the heart and arouse the powers of the soul as nothing else will. The work of redemption is a marvelous
          work; it is a mystery in the universe of God. But how indifferent are the objects of such matchless grace!
          ...</p>
      <p>If our senses had not been blunted by sin and by contemplation of the dark pictures that Satan is constantly
          presenting before us, a fervent and continuous ﬂow of gratitude would go out from our hearts toward Him who
          daily loads us with beneﬁts of which we are wholly undeserving. The everlasting song of the redeemed will be
          praise to Him who hath loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood; and if we ever sing that song
          before the throne of God we must learn it here.”<span class="ft11">17</span></p>
