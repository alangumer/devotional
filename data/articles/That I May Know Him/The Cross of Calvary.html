    <h1>The Cross of Calvary</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they cruciﬁed him, and the
          malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Luke 23:33.</strong></p>
      <p>The cross of Calvary appeals in power, affording a reason why we should love Christ now, and why we should
          consider Him ﬁrst, and best, and last, in everything. We should take our ﬁtting place in humble penitence at
          the foot of the cross. We may learn the lessons of meekness and lowliness of mind as we go up to Mount
          Calvary, and, looking upon the cross, see our Saviour in agony, the Son of God dying, the Just for the unjust.
          Behold Him who could summon legions of angels to His assistance with one word, a subject of jest and
          merriment, of reviling and hatred. He gives Himself a sacriﬁce for sin. When reviled, He threatened not; when
          falsely accused, He opened not His mouth. He prays on the cross for His murderers. He is dying for them. He is
          paying an inﬁnite price for every one of them. He would not lose one whom He has purchased at so great cost.
          He gives Himself to be smitten and scourged without a murmur. And this uncomplaining victim is the Son of God.
          His throne is from everlasting, and His kingdom shall have no end.... Look, O look upon the cross of Calvary;
          behold</p>
      <p>the royal victim suffering on your account....</p>
      <p>The Son of God was rejected and despised for our sakes. Can you, in full view of the cross, beholding by the
          eye of faith the sufferings of Christ, tell your tale of woe, your trials? Can you nurse revenge of your
          enemies in your heart while the prayer of Christ comes from His pale and quivering lips for His revilers, His
          <nobr>murderers—“Father,</nobr> forgive them; for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34)? ...</p>
      <p>We must not shrink from the depths of humiliation to which the Son of God submitted in order to raise us from
          the degradation and bondage of sin to a seat at His right hand.... It is high time we devoted the few</p>
      <p>remaining precious hours of our probation to washing our robes of character and making them white in the blood
          of the Lamb, that we may be of that <nobr>white-robed</nobr> company who shall stand about the great white
          throne.<span class="ft22">36</span></p>
