    <h1>“Take Heed Unto Thyself”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save
          thyself, and them that hear thee. 1 Timothy 4:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Some seem to think that there is a certain amount of virtue in expressing their dissatisfaction in whatever is
          being done by others....</p>
      <p>There was Judas; Christ permitted him to be a member of the church, notwithstanding his covetous, avaricious
          character. He had some traits that might have been used to the glory of God, but he did not try to overcome
          the defects in his character. Christ bore with him long and patiently.... He had the same lessons set</p>
      <p>before him that were given to the other apostles, which would have set him right had he made a right use of
          them, but he did not sustain a right relation to Heaven. Christ knew his true condition, and gave him an
          opportunity. He connected John with the church, not because John was above human frailties, but that He might
          bind him to His great heart of love. If John overcame his defects of character, he would stand as a light to
          the church. Peter, if he corrected his faults, would inherit the promises of God. And Jesus said to him, after
          His resurrection, notwithstanding that he had but a few days before denied Him, “Feed my sheep,” and “Feed my
          lambs” (John 21:16, 15). He could trust Peter now, for he had obtained an experience in the things of
          God....</p>
      <p>John was constantly learning to copy the life of Jesus. He was learning in Christ’s school.... Lesson
          after</p>
      <p>lesson Christ gave to His disciples, that they might know the will of the Father and shine as lights in the
          world. John and Peter were men whom God could trust, but Judas was not. They had received and heeded the
          lessons and gained the victory, but Judas had failed at every trial. He saw his faults, but instead of
          correcting them revenged himself by picking ﬂaws in others around him.... Paul says to Timothy, “Take heed
          unto thyself”; that</p>
      <p>is, seek God ﬁrst for thyself. Let us individually turn our attention to ourselves, diligently guard our own
          souls, and set a Christlike example before those whom we would criticise.<span class="ft15">28</span></p>
