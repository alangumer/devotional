    <h1>How to Resist Satan</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will ﬂee from you. James
          4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Our work is to “resist the devil,” not harbor his doubts; and if we do this, the promise is “he will ﬂee from
          you.”</p>
      <p>But the question is often asked, How can I resist Satan? There is only one way by which you can do this, and
          that is by faith, taking Christ as your helper and pleading with Him for strength. When Satan suggests doubt
          to your soul, when he tells you that you are too unworthy, too sinful, to realize the blessing of God, present
          Christ before him as your Advocate and Saviour. Tell him you know that you are a sinner, but that Jesus came
          to seek and save that which was lost. He came “not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance” (Mark
          2:17).</p>
      <p>Repeat His promises: “Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out” (John 6:37).... “Let him take hold</p>
      <p>of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me” (Isaiah 27:5). “Whatsoever ye
          shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive” (Matthew 21:22). Be simplehearted enough to believe these
          promises of God. When Satan comes to you, and tells you that because you are unhappy, perplexed, and troubled
          you are not a child of God, do not become discouraged for one moment, but gird up the loins of your mind. Let
          your heart repose in God. He has promised that if you come to Him, you shall ﬁnd rest to your soul; and if you
          have done this, rest assured that He will fulﬁll His word in you....</p>
      <p>Many pass long years in darkness and doubt because they do not feel as they desire. But feeling has nothing to
          do with faith. That faith which works by love and puriﬁes the soul is not a matter of impulse. It ventures out
          upon the promises of God, ﬁrmly believing that what He has said, He is able also to perform. Our souls may be
          trained to believe, taught to rely upon the Word of God. That Word declares that “the just shall live by
          faith” (Romans 1:17), not by feeling.<span class="ft11">38</span></p>
