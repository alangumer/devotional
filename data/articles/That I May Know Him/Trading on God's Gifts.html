      <p><strong>And unto one he gave ﬁve talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his
          several ability; and straightway took his journey. Matthew 25:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The parable of the talents ... has a personal and individual application to every man, woman, and child
          possessed of the powers of reason. Your obligation and responsibility are in proportion to the talents God has
          bestowed upon you....</p>
      <p>When the master of the house called his servants, he gave to every man his work. The whole family of God are
          included in the responsibility of using their Lord’s goods. Every individual, from the lowliest and most
          obscure to the greatest and most exalted, is a moral agent endowed with abilities for which he is accountable
          to God.... The spiritual, mental, and physical ability, the inﬂuence, station, possessions, affections,
          sympathies, all</p>
      <p>are precious talents to be used in the cause of the Master....</p>
      <p>Let the businessman do his business in a way that will glorify his Master because of his ﬁdelity. Let him carry
          his religion into everything that is done, and reveal to men the Spirit of Christ. Let the mechanic be a
          diligent and faithful representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks of life in the cities of Judea. Let
          every one who names the name of Christ so work, that man by seeing his good works may be led to glorify his
          Creator and Redeemer....</p>
      <p>Those who have been blessed with superior talents should not depreciate the value of the services of those who
          are less gifted than themselves. The smallest trust is a trust from God. The one talent, through diligent use
          with the blessing of God, will be doubled, and the two used in the service of Christ will be increased to
          four; and thus the humblest instrument may grow in power and usefulness. The earnest purpose, the
          <nobr>self-denying</nobr> efforts, are all seen, appreciated, and accepted by the God of heaven.... God alone
          can estimate the worth of their service</p>
      <p>and see the <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> inﬂuence of him who works for the glory of his Maker.<span
