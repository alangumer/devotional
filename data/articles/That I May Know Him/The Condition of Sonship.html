    <h1>The Condition of Sonship</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
          thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the
          Lord Almighty. 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>Do you desire to become the sons and daughters of the Most High? Here is stated the condition of this great
          privilege. Come out, be separate, touch not the unclean. You cannot keep the fellowship of the world,
          participate in its pleasures, identify yourself with its interests, and still be the sons of God. Says John,
          “The world knoweth us not, because it knew him not” (1 John 3:1). But shall we let the desire for the favor of
          our Lord’s enemies weigh against our accepting the conditions of salvation? ...</p>
      <p>There are great things expected from the sons and daughters of God. I look upon the youth of today, and my
          heart yearns over them. What possibilities are open before them! If they sincerely seek to learn of Christ, He
          will give them wisdom, as He gave wisdom to Daniel.... Let the youth try to appreciate the privilege that may
          be</p>
      <p>theirs, to be directed by the unerring wisdom of God....</p>
      <p>It is thought a great honor to be invited into the presence of a king of this earth. But let us consider the
          amazing privilege that is proffered to us. If we obey the requirements of God we may become the sons and
          daughters of the King of the universe. Through a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour we may be ﬁlled with the fruits of
          righteousness, and be ﬁtted to shine in the courts of the King of kings through unending ages. The world does
          not know the exaltation of the sons and daughters of the Most High. Those around them do not see that the
          humble, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> spirit, the patient meekness of heart, has any extraordinary value. They did
          not know or appreciate Christ.... They could not understand Him; and the greater our likeness to the divine
          character of</p>
      <p>our Lord, the more we shall be misunderstood by the world. The more we come into fellowship with Christ and
          heaven, the less will be our fellowship with the world, for we are not of the world.<span
