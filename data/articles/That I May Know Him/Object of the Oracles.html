    <h1>Object of the Oracles</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. Psalm
          119:130.</strong></p>
      <p>The light and understanding which God’s Word imparts is not designed merely, or chieﬂy, to promote intellectual
          culture. For an object higher than any earthly or temporal good were the holy oracles committed unto men. We
          see therein revealed the great plan of human redemption, the means devised to free mankind from the power of
          Satan. We see Christ, the Captain of our salvation, meeting the prince of darkness in open battle, and
          <nobr>single-handed,</nobr> obtaining the victory in our behalf. We learn too that by this victory was opened
          to us a door of hope, a source of strength, and that we may, as faithful soldiers, ﬁght our own battles with
          the wily foe, and conquer in the name of Jesus. The powers of darkness must be met by every soul. The young as
          well as the old will be assailed, and all should understand the nature of the great controversy between Christ
          and Satan, and should realize that it concerns themselves....</p>
      <p>It is not enough to have an intellectual knowledge of the truth.... There must be an entrance of the Word
          into</p>
      <p>the heart. It must be set home by the power of the Holy Spirit. The will must be brought into harmony with its
          requirements. Not only the intellect but the heart and conscience must concur in the acceptance of the
          truth.</p>
      <p>The entrance of God’s Word gives understanding to the <nobr>simple—those</nobr> who are untaught in the wisdom
          of the world. The Holy Spirit brings the saving truths of the Scriptures within the comprehension of all who
          desire to know and do the will of God. Uneducated minds are enabled to grasp the most sublime and
          <nobr>soul-stirring</nobr> themes that can engage the attention of <nobr>men—themes</nobr> that will be the
          study and the song of the redeemed through all eternity.</p>
      <p>It is the knowledge which God’s Word supplies, and which can be found nowhere else, that we need above every
          other. We want to know what to do in this our day to escape the snares of Satan and to win the crown of
          glory.<span class="ft11">8</span></p>
