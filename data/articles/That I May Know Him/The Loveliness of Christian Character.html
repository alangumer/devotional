    <h1>The Loveliness of Christian Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the
          residue of his people. Isaiah 28:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Many seem to think only of the outward adorning, and they make it evident that they are not in Christ by the
          apparel in which they deck themselves.<span class="ft15">33</span></p>
      <p>We are to cultivate the loveliness of Christian character, and to seek the inward adorning.... The religion
          of</p>
      <p>Christ never degrades the receiver; it ennobles and elevates. Upon certain conditions we are assured that we
          may become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. Is not this exaltation something worth
          seeking for? Through faith in Christ and obedience to the requirements of His law we are offered a life that
          shall run parallel with the life of God. And in that immortal life there shall be no sorrow, no sighing, no
          pain, no sin, no death. O that we might be more <nobr>heavenly-minded</nobr> and bring more of heaven into our
          life and conversation!</p>
      <p>But with all the rich promises of God, how many seem wholly absorbed in the things of earth. They are all taken
          up with the thought of what shall we eat, what shall we drink, and wherewithal shall we be clothed? God would
          not have us center our minds upon the things of this world. We are not to seek for our selﬁsh gratiﬁcation,
          but to center the mind upon Christ. Are you separating yourself from everything that will separate you from
          God? If you are in close connection with God you will talk of Him, you will have an abundance in your heart of
          the things of heaven....</p>
      <p>The Lord is waiting to do great things for His children who trust in Him. Do we expect to dwell with Christ in
          the eternal world? Then we must dwell with Him here, that He may help us in every time of trial and temptation
          and make us ready for His coming in the clouds of heaven.... The beauty and grace of Christ must be woven
          into</p>
      <p>our characters. We cannot keep Christ so apart from our lives as we do, and yet be ﬁtted for His companionship
          in heaven. He is to be the all in all of heaven, and must be our all in all upon earth.<span
