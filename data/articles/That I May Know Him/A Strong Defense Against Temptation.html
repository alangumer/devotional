    <h1>A Strong Defense Against Temptation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
          Hebrews 2:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Our Redeemer perfectly understood the wants of humanity. He who condescended to take upon Himself man’s nature
          was acquainted with man’s weakness. Christ lived as our example. He was tempted in all points as we are, that
          He might know how to succor all who should be tempted. He has trodden the path of life before us and endured
          the severest tests in our behalf. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief....</p>
      <p>Christ took upon Himself our inﬁrmities, and in the weakness of humanity He needed to seek strength from His
          Father. He was often to be found in earnest prayer, in the grove, by the lakeside, and in the mountains. He
          has enjoined upon us to watch and pray.... Without a deep sense of our need of help from God there will</p>
      <p>be but little earnest, heartfelt prayer for divine aid. Our hearts are deceitful, our foes many and vigilant.
          If we neglect to fortify a single weak point in our character, Satan will assail us at that point with his
          temptations. He is constantly plotting the ruin of the soul, and he will take every advantage of our careless
          security.</p>
      <p>Christ came to our world to engage in singlehanded combat with this enemy of man, and thus to wrest the race
          from Satan’s grasp. In the accomplishment of this object He withheld not His own life. And now, in the
          strength that Christ will give, man must stand for himself, a faithful sentinel against the wily, plotting
          foe. Says the great apostle, “Walk <nobr>circumspectly”—guard</nobr> every avenue of the soul, look constantly
          to Jesus, the true and perfect Pattern, and seek to imitate His example, not in one or two points merely, but
          in all things. We shall then be prepared for any and every emergency.... He whose mind loves to dwell upon God
          has a strong defense. He</p>
      <p>will be quick to perceive the dangers that threaten his spiritual life, and a sense of danger will lead him to
          call upon God for help and protection.<span class="ft15">32</span></p>
