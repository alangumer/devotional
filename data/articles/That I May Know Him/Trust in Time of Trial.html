    <h1>Trust in Time of Trial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
          according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.</strong></p>
      <p>The Christian’s hope does not rest upon the sandy foundation of feeling. Those who act from principle will
          behold the glory of God beyond the shadows, and rest upon the sure word of promise. They will not be deterred
          from honoring God however dark the way may seem. Adversity and trial will only give them an opportunity to
          show the sincerity of their faith and love. When depression settles upon the soul, it is no evidence that God
          has changed. He is “the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever” (Hebrews 13:8). You are sure of the favor of
          God when you are sensible of the beams of the Sun of Righteousness; but if the clouds sweep over your soul,
          you must not feel that you are forsaken. Your faith must pierce the gloom.... The riches of the grace of
          Christ must be</p>
      <p>kept before the mind. Treasure up the lessons that His love provides. Let your faith be like Job’s, that you
          may declare, “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him” (Job 13:15). Lay hold on the promises of your
          heavenly Father and remember His former dealing with you and with His servants, for “all things work together
          for good to them that love God.”</p>
      <p>The most trying experiences in the Christian’s life may be the most blessed. The special providences of the
          dark hours may encourage the soul in future attacks of Satan, and equip the servant of God to stand in ﬁery
          trials. The trial of your faith is more precious than gold. You must have that abiding conﬁdence in God that
          is not disturbed by the temptations and arguments of the deceiver. Take the Lord at His word....</p>
      <p>It is faith that familiarizes the soul with the existence and presence of God, and when we live with an eye
          single to His glory we discern more and more the beauty of His character. Our souls become strong in spiritual
          power, for we are breathing the atmosphere of heaven and realizing that God is at our right hand.... We
          should</p>
      <p>live as in the presence of the Inﬁnite One.<span class="ft15">9</span></p>
