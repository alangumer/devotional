    <h1>The Faith God Accepts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. James
          2:26.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many in the Christian world who claim that all that is necessary to salvation is to have faith; works
          are nothing, faith is the only essential. But God’s Word tells us that faith without works is dead, being
          alone....</p>
      <p>Faith and works go hand in hand.... Works will never save us; it is the merit of Christ that will avail in our
          behalf.</p>
      <p>Through faith in Him, Christ will make all our imperfect efforts acceptable to God. The faith we are required
          to have is not a <nobr>do-nothing</nobr> faith; saving faith is that which works by love and puriﬁes the soul.
          He who will lift up holy hands to God without wrath and doubting will walk intelligently in the way of God’s
          commandments.</p>
      <p>If we are to have pardon for our sins we must ﬁrst have a realization of what sin is, that we may repent and
          bring forth fruits meet for repentance. We must have a solid foundation for our faith; it must be founded on
          the Word of God, and its results will be seen in obedience to God’s expressed will.... Faith and works will
          keep</p>
      <p>us evenly balanced, and make us successful in the work of perfecting Christian character.... We are living in
          an</p>
      <p>important and interesting period of this earth’s history. We need more faith than we have yet had; we need a
          ﬁrmer hold from above. Satan is working with all power to obtain the victory over us, for he knows that he has
          but a short time in which to work....</p>
      <p>There is no excuse for sin or for indolence. Jesus has led the way, and He wishes us to follow in His steps. He
          has suffered, He has sacriﬁced as none of us can, that He might bring salvation within our reach. We need not
          be discouraged. Jesus came to our world to bring divine power to man, that through His grace we might be
          transformed into His likeness. When it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put forth to this end,
          Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as man’s best service, and He makes up for the deﬁciency with His
          own divine merit.<span class="ft11">16</span></p>
