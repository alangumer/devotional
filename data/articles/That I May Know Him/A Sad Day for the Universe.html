    <h1>A Sad Day for the Universe</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
          men, for that all have sinned. Romans 5:12.</strong></p>
      <p>When our ﬁrst parents were placed in the beautiful garden of Eden, they were tested in regard to their loyalty
          to God. They were free to choose the service of God, or by disobedience to ally themselves with the enemy of
          God and man.... If they disregard God’s commands, and listened to the voice of Satan, as he spoke through
          the</p>
      <p>serpent, they would not only forfeit their claim to Eden, but to life itself.<span class="ft15">15</span></p>
      <p>The ﬁrst great moral lesson given Adam was that of <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> The reins of
          <nobr>self-government</nobr> were placed in his hands. Judgment, reason, and conscience were to bear
          sway....</p>
      <p>Adam and Eve were permitted to partake of every tree in the Garden save one. There was only a single
          prohibition. The forbidden tree was as attractive and lovely as any of the trees in the Garden. It was called
          the tree of knowledge, because in partaking of that tree, of which God had said, “Thou shalt not eat of it,”
          (Genesis 2:17) they would have a knowledge of sin, an experience in disobedience.<span

      <p>With what intense interest the whole universe watched the conﬂict that was to decide the position of Adam and
          Eve. How attentively the angels listened to the words of Satan, the originator of sin, as he ... sought to
          make of none effect the law of God through his deceptive reasoning! How anxiously they waited to see if the
          holy pair would be deluded by the tempter, and yield to his arts! They asked themselves, Will the holy pair
          transfer their faith and love from the Father and Son to Satan? Will they accept his falsehoods as truth?<span
          class="ft17">17</span></p>
      <p>Adam and Eve persuaded themselves that in so small a matter as eating of the forbidden fruit, there could not
          result such terrible consequences as God had declared. But this small matter was sin, the transgression of
          God’s immutable and holy law, and it opened the ﬂoodgates of death and untold woe upon our world.... Let
          us</p>
      <p>not esteem sin as a trivial thing.<span class="ft15">18</span></p>
