      <p><strong>For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his
          servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Mark 13:34.</strong></p>
      <p>When God commanded the tabernacle to be built in the wilderness, each man’s work was assigned him....</p>
      <p>In setting up and taking down the tabernacle, in moving from place to place in the wilderness, the position
          each was to occupy was plainly speciﬁed.</p>
      <p>Christ was the invisible General of that company of more than a million people, and there were no haphazard,
          disorderly movements made. Order, dispatch, and exactitude were required of each one at the post of duty
          assigned him. This is an important lesson to the church and to every man whom God has chosen to act a part in
          His great work. No one is required to do another’s work. Each is to do the work assigned him with exactness
          and integrity. The management of that great church in their journeyings in the wilderness symbolizes the
          management of the church till the close of earth’s history, till we come into possession of the heavenly
          Canaan....</p>
      <p>The Lord has need of all kinds of skillful workmen. “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
          evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
          for the edifying of the body of Christ” (Ephesians 4:11, 12). ... Each worker in every branch of work in the
          Lord’s vineyard must have a head and a heart sanctiﬁed through the truth to enable him to see not merely the
          part of the work which is under his supervision, but its relation to the great whole. When the workers are
          consecrated to God they will reveal the love of God for their brethren who work under the unseen, divine
          Master Worker. “We are labourers together with God” (1 Corinthians 3:9)....</p>
      <p>We are all part of the great web of humanity, thread packed against thread to bring out the pattern of the
          fabric and make it a complete whole.... Be God’s thread to work out His design. You can never handle
          yourself.<span class="ft22">16</span></p>
