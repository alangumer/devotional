    <h1>When You Are Growing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now
          and for ever. Amen. 2 Peter 3:18.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the privilege of the young, as they grow in Jesus, to grow in spiritual grace and knowledge. We may know
          more and more of Jesus through an interested searching of the Scriptures and then following the ways of truth
          and righteousness therein revealed. Those who are ever growing in grace will be steadfast in the faith, and
          moving forward. There should be an earnest desire in the heart of every youth who has purposed to be a
          disciple of Jesus Christ to reach the highest Christian standard, to be a worker with Christ. If he makes it
          his aim to be of that number who shall be presented faultless before the throne of God he will be continually
          advancing. The only way to remain steadfast is to progress daily in divine life. Faith will increase if, when
          brought in conﬂict with doubts and obstacles, it overcomes them.... If you are growing in grace and the
          knowledge of Jesus Christ</p>
      <p>you will improve every privilege and opportunity to gain more knowledge of the life and character of Christ.
          Faith in Jesus will grow as you become better acquainted with your Redeemer by dwelling upon His spotless</p>
      <p>life and His inﬁnite love.... When you are growing in grace you will love to attend religious meetings, and
          you</p>
      <p>will gladly bear testimony of the love of Christ before the congregation. God, by His grace, can make the young
          man prudent, and He can give to the children knowledge and experience. They can grow in grace daily....
          Set</p>
      <p>your aim in life high, as did Joseph and Daniel and Moses, and take into consideration the cost of the
          character building, and then build for time and for eternity.... In doing this work for yourself you are
          having an inﬂuence</p>
      <p>on many others.... How much strength a word of hope, courage, and determination in a right course will
          give</p>
      <p>one who is inclined to slide into habits that are demoralizing! The ﬁrm purpose you may possess in carrying out
          good principles will have an inﬂuence to balance souls in the right direction. There is no limit to the good
          you may do.<span class="ft11">5</span></p>
