    <h1>The Righteousness That God Requires</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
          Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was of a selﬁsh character, consisting of external forms. The
          righteousness which God requires is internal as well as external. The heart must be puriﬁed, else Christ
          cannot be enthroned there. The life must be conformed to the will of God.<span class="ft11">26</span></p>
      <p>External forms cannot take the place of inward piety. The Jewish teachers exalted themselves as righteous; they
          called all those who differed from them accursed, and closed the gates of heaven to them, declaring that those
          who had not learned in their schools, were not righteous. But with all their criticisms and exactions, with
          all their forms and ceremonies, they were an offense to God. They looked down upon and despised the very ones
          precious in the sight of the Lord....</p>
      <p>Human devices, human plans, and human counsels will be without power. Only in Christ Jesus will the church near
          the period of Christ’s coming be able to stand. She is required of her Redeemer to advance in piety, to have
          increasing zeal, understanding better as she nears the end that her own “high calling” is “of God in Christ
          Jesus.”</p>
      <p>There are glorious truths to come before the people of God. Privileges and duties which they do not even
          suspect to be in the Bible will be laid open before the followers of Christ. As they follow on in the path of
          humble obedience, doing God’s will, they will know more and more of the oracles of God, and be established in
          right doctrines.</p>
      <p>The baptism of the Holy Spirit will dispel human imaginings, will break down <nobr>self-erected</nobr>
          barriers, and will cause to cease the feeling that “I am holier than thou.” There will be a humble spirit with
          all, more faith and love; self will not be exalted.... Christ’s spirit, Christ’s example, will be exempliﬁed
          in His people. We shall follow</p>
      <p>more closely the ways and works of Jesus.... The love of Jesus will pervade our hearts.<span
