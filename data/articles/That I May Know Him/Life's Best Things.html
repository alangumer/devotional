    <h1>Life’s Best Things</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. John
          10:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Every moment of our life is intensely real. Life is no play; it is charged with awful importance, fraught with
          eternal responsibilities. When we look upon life from this point of view, we realize our need of divine help.
          The conviction will be forced upon us that a life without Christ will be a life of utter failure, but if Jesus
          abides with us, we shall live for a purpose. We shall then realize that without the power of God’s grace and
          Spirit we cannot reach the high standard He has placed before us. There is a divine excellence of character to
          which we are to attain, and in striving to meet the standard of heaven, divine incentives will urge us on, the
          mind will become balanced, and the restlessness of the soul will be banished in repose in Christ.</p>
      <p>How often do we come in contact with people who are never happy. They fail of enjoying the contentment and
          peace that Jesus can give. They profess to be Christians but they do not comply with the conditions upon which
          the promise of God is fulﬁlled. Jesus has said, “Come unto me.... Take my yoke upon you, and learn of</p>
      <p>me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden
          is light” (Matthew <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr> The reason why many are in a state of unrest is that they are not
          learning in the school of the Master. The submissive, <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> child of God understands by
          experience what it is to have the peace of Christ.<span class="ft11">26</span></p>
      <p>Life’s best <nobr>things—simplicity,</nobr> honesty, truthfulness, purity, unsullied <nobr>integrity—are</nobr>
          not to be bought or sold. They are free to the illiterate as to the educated, to the white man as to the black
          man, to the poor man as to the king upon his throne....</p>
      <p>In the ﬁeld of life we are all sowing seeds. As we sow, so shall we reap. Those who sow <nobr>self-love,</nobr>
          bitterness, jealousy, will reap a like harvest. Those who sow unselﬁsh love, kindness, tender thoughtfulness
          for the feelings of others, will reap a precious harvest.<span class="ft11">27</span></p>
