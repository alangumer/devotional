    <h1>A Hidden Treasure</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a ﬁeld; the which when a man hath found, he
          hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that ﬁeld. Matthew
          13:44.</strong></p>
      <p>Without the kingdom of God we are lost ... and are without hope in the world, but salvation has been provided
          for us through faith in Jesus Christ. He is the treasure, and when the rubbish of the world is swept away, we
          are enabled to discern His inﬁnite value....</p>
      <p>The divinity of Christ was as a hidden treasure. At times when He was upon earth divinity ﬂashed through
          humanity, and His true character was revealed. The God of heaven testiﬁed to His oneness with His Son. At His
          baptism the heavens were opened and the glory of God in the similitude of a dove like burnished gold hovered
          over the Saviour, and a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”
          (Matthew 3:17). But the nation to whom Christ came, though professing to be the peculiar people of God, did
          not recognize the heavenly treasure in the person of Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>The Majesty of heaven was not discerned in the disguise of humanity. He was the divine Teacher sent from God,
          the glorious Treasure given to humanity. He was fairer than the sons of men, but His matchless glory was
          hidden under a cover of poverty and suffering. He veiled His glory in order that divinity might touch
          humanity, and the treasure of immense value was not discerned by the human race....</p>
      <p>“The Word was made ﬂesh, and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). The treasure indeed is hidden under the garb of
          humanity. Christ is the unsearchable riches, and he who ﬁnds Christ ﬁnds heaven. The human agent who looks
          upon Jesus, who dwells by faith on His matchless charms, ﬁnds the eternal treasure.<span

      <p>Christ does not use this parable to commend the man who hides the treasure until he can buy the ﬁeld, but His
          object in using this illustration is to convey to our mind the value of spiritual things. To obtain worldly
          treasure, the man would make a sacriﬁce of his all, and how much more should we give for the priceless,
          heavenly treasure!<span class="ft11">28</span></p>
