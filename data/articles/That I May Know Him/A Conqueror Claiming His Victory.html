    <h1>A Conqueror Claiming His Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful
          and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
          Hebrews 2:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Of the high priest of Israel we read, “Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate
          of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually”
          (Exodus 28:29). What a beautiful and expressive ﬁgure this is of the unchanging love of Christ for His church!
          Our great High Priest, of whom Aaron was a type, bears His people upon His heart.... Christ as the great
          high</p>
      <p>priest, making a perfect atonement for sin, stands alone in divine majesty and glory. Other high priests were
          only types, and when He appeared, the need of their services vanished .... Let human beings, subject to
          temptation,</p>
      <p>remember that in the heavenly courts they have a high priest who is touched with the feeling of their
          inﬁrmities, because He Himself was tempted, even as they are.<span class="ft15">12</span></p>
      <p>Christ is the minister of the true tabernacle, the high priest of all who believe in Him as a personal Saviour,
          and His ofﬁce no other can take. He is the high priest of the church....</p>
      <p>Christ offered up His broken body to purchase back God’s heritage, to give man another trial. “Wherefore he is
          able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
          for them” (Hebrews 7:25). By His spotless life, His obedience, His death on the cross of Calvary, Christ
          interceded for the lost race. And now, not as a mere petitioner does the Captain of our salvation intercede
          for us, but as a conqueror claiming His victory. His offering is complete, and as our intercessor He executes
          His <nobr>self-appointed</nobr> work, holding before God the censer containing His own spotless merits and the
          prayers, confessions, and thanksgiving of His people. Perfumed with the fragrance of His righteousness, these
          ascend to God as a sweet savor. The offering is wholly acceptable, and pardon covers all transgression.<span
