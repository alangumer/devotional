    <h1>A Child in the Temple</h1>

      <p><strong>Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business? Luke 2:49.</strong></p>
      <p>When Christ was twelve years old He went with His parents to Jerusalem to attend the feast of the Passover, and
          on their return He was lost in the multitude. After Joseph and Mary had searched for Him for three days, they
          found Him in the court of the Temple, “sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them
          questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers” (Luke 2:46, 47).<span
          class="ft22">45</span></p>
      <p>His parents listened in amazement as they heard His searching inquiries.... Though taking the attitude of
          a</p>
      <p>learner, Christ imparted light in every word He uttered. He interpreted the Scripture to the darkened mind of
          the rabbis, and gave them clear light in regard to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. The
          sharp, clear questions of the child learner brought a ﬂood of light to their darkened understanding. The truth
          shone out as the clear shining of a light in a darkened place, as He received and imparted the knowledge of
          the plan of salvation.</p>
      <p>It is plainly stated that Christ grew in knowledge. What a lesson is found in this incident in the life of
          Christ for all youth! If they shall diligently search the Word of God, and through the Holy Spirit receive
          divine guidance, they will be able to impart light to others....</p>
      <p>Mary, the mother of Jesus, ... asked, “Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have
          sought thee sorrowing.” Divine light shone through humanity as Jesus lifted His right hand and asked, “How is
          it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business? And they understood not the
          saying which he spake unto them” (verses <nobr>48-50).</nobr> They did not comprehend the true meaning of His
          words. But, though He was the Son of God, He went down with His parents and came unto Nazareth, and was
          subject unto them.... At the age of twelve the Holy Spirit was abiding upon Jesus and He felt something of the
          burden</p>
      <p>of the mission for which He had come to our world.<span class="ft15">46</span></p>
