    <h1>God’s Peculiar People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
          people, zealous of good works. Titus 2:14.</strong></p>
      <p>That which more especially distinguishes God’s people from the popular religious bodies is not their profession
          alone, but their exemplary character and their principles of unselﬁsh love. The powerful and purifying
          inﬂuence of the Spirit of God upon the heart, carried out in words and works, separates them from the world,
          and designates them as God’s peculiar people. The character and disposition of Christ’s followers will be like
          the Master. He is the pattern, the holy and perfect example given for Christians to imitate....</p>
      <p>The <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> humility, and temperance required of the righteous ... are ... in contrast with
          the extravagant, <nobr>health-destroying</nobr> habits of the people who live in this degenerate age. God has
          shown that health reform is as closely connected with the third angel’s message as the hand is united to the
          body. And there is nowhere to be found so great a cause of physical and moral degeneracy as a neglect of this
          important subject.... Whoever</p>
      <p>violates moral obligations in the matter of eating and dressing prepares the way to violate the claims of God
          in regard to eternal interests. Our bodies are not our own. God has claims upon us to take care of the
          habitation He has given us, that we may present our bodies to Him a living sacriﬁce, holy and acceptable. Our
          bodies belong to Him who made them, and we are in duty bound to become intelligent in regard to the best means
          of preserving from decay the habitation He has given us. If we enfeeble the body by
          <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation,</nobr> by indulging the appetite, and by dressing in accordance with
          <nobr>health-destroying</nobr> fashions, in order to be in harmony with the world, we become enemies of
          God....</p>
      <p>God requires of us according to the grace He has bestowed upon us.... In order for us to meet our</p>
      <p>responsibilities we must stand on that elevated ground that the order and advancement of holy, sacred truth has
          prepared for us.<span class="ft15">9</span></p>
