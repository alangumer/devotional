    <h1>Tender, Loving, Compassionate</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> and
          plenteous in mercy and truth. Psalm 86:15.</strong></p>
      <p>God has ordained according to the law of ministry that we should comfort one another in tenderness and love
          when great sorrows come upon us. No man liveth unto himself. No one dieth unto himself. Life and death both
          mean something to every human being.... God has enjoined the duty upon His human agents to communicate
          the</p>
      <p>character of God, testifying to His grace, His wisdom, and His benevolence, by manifesting His reﬁned, tender,
          merciful love.... Jesus ... was ever touched with human woe, and our hearts should be softened and subdued
          by</p>
      <p>His Holy Spirit, that we may be like Him....</p>
      <p>Our work is to restore the moral image of God in man through the abundant grace given us of God by Jesus
          Christ. Everywhere we shall ﬁnd souls ready to die, and how essential it is that the compassion of Christ
          shall be given us of Him, in order that we may never place one soul in deﬁance by not manifesting long
          forbearance and pitying tenderness.... I inquire, Will we ever learn the gentleness of Christ? Oh, how much we
          need to know</p>
      <p>Jesus and our heavenly Father that we may represent Him in character! ...</p>
      <p>Jesus calls us to Himself not simply to refresh us with His grace and presence for a few hours, and then to
          send us forth from His light to walk apart from Him in sadness and gloom. No, no. He tells us that we must
          abide with Him and He with us. Wherever His work is to be done He is <nobr>present—tender,</nobr> loving, and
          compassionate. He has prepared for you and me an abiding dwelling place in Himself. He is our refuge. Our
          experience should broaden and deepen. Jesus has opened up all the divine fullness of His inexpressible love,
          and He declares to you, Ye “are labourers together with God” (1 Corinthians 3:9). O what meaning these words
          <nobr>have—“Abide</nobr> in me” (John 15:4), “Take my yoke upon you” (Matthew 11:29). Will we take it? for the
          promise is, “Ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls.” There is rest, complete rest in abiding in Christ.<span
