    <h1>The Sum and Substance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
          sent. John 17:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The sum and substance of the whole matter of Christian grace and experience is contained in believing on
          Christ, in knowing God and His Son whom He hath sent. But here is where many fail, for they lack faith in God.
          Instead of desiring to be brought into fellowship with Christ in His <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and humiliation,
          they are ever seeking for the supremacy of self.... O if we did but appreciate the love of God, how our hearts
          would be</p>
      <p>expanded, our limited sympathies would be enlarged, and break away from the icy barriers of selﬁshness, and our
          comprehension would be deeper than it now is....</p>
      <p>It is because we do not know God, we do not have faith in Christ, that we are not deeply impressed with the
          humiliation He endured in our behalf, that His abasement does not lead us to the humbling of self, to the
          exalting of Jesus.... O if you loved Him as He has loved you, you would not shun an experience in the dark
          chapters of</p>
      <p>the suffering of the Son of God!</p>
      <p>In order to be partakers with Christ in His sufferings, we must behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the
          sin of the world. When we contemplate the humiliation of Christ, beholding His <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> we are ﬁlled with amazement at the manifestation of divine love for guilty man.
          When for Christ’s sake we are called to pass through trials that are of a humiliating nature, if we have the
          mind of Christ we shall suffer them with meekness, not resenting injury, or resisting evil. We shall manifest
          the spirit that dwelt in Christ.... We are</p>
      <p>to understand what the sacriﬁce, the labors, and the sufferings of Christ are, in order that we may cooperate
          with Him in working out the great scheme of redemption.<span class="ft15">12</span></p>
      <p>The knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ expressed in character is the very highest education. It is the key
          that opens the portals of the heavenly city. This knowledge it is God’s purpose that all who put on Christ
          shall possess.<span class="ft11">13</span></p>
