    <h1>Greatest Educator of All Time</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The people were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
          scribes. Matthew 7:28, 29.</strong></p>
      <p>The world’s men of learning are not easily reached by the practical truths of God’s Word. The reason is, they
          trust to human wisdom and pride themselves upon their intellectual superiority, and are unwilling to become
          humble learners in the school of Christ.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour did not ignore learning or despise education, yet He chose unlearned ﬁshermen for the work of the
          gospel because they had not been schooled in the false customs and traditions of the world. They were men of
          good natural ability and of a humble, teachable spirit, men whom He could educate for His great work. In the
          ordinary walks of life there is many a man patiently treading the round of daily toil, all unconscious that he
          possesses power which if called into action would raise him to an equality with the world’s most honored men.
          The touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse and develop those dormant faculties. It was such men whom
          Jesus connected with Himself, and He gave them the advantages of three years’ training under His own care. No
          course of study in the schools of the rabbis or the halls of philosophy could have equaled this in value. The
          Son of God was the greatest educator the world ever knew.</p>
      <p>The learned lawyers, priests, and scribes scorned to be taught by Christ. They desired to teach Him, and
          frequently made the attempt, only to be defeated by the wisdom that laid bare their ignorance and rebuked
          their folly.... They knew that He had not learned in the schools of the prophets, and they could not discern
          the divine</p>
      <p>excellence of His character beneath the lowly disguise of the Man of Nazareth. But the words and deeds of the
          humble Teacher, recorded by the unlettered companions of His daily life, have exerted a living power upon the
          minds of men from that day to the present. Not merely the ignorant and humble, but men of education,
          intellect, and genius reverently exclaim, with the wondering and delighted listeners of old, “Never man spake
          like this man” (John 7:46).<span class="ft11">4</span></p>
