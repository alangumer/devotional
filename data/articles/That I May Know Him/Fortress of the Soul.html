      <p><strong>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Ephesians
          6:10.</strong></p>
      <p>This has always been applicable to God’s people in every age of the world, but how much more so to the remnant
          church who have to meet the constant and most powerful masterly workings of the power of darkness for this
          last time. The words of the apostle come sounding down the lines to this time: “Put on the whole armour of
          God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against ﬂesh and blood,
          but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
          spiritual wickedness in high places” (Ephesians 6:11, 12).</p>
      <p>These words inspired of God are appropriate for us. They apply in a special manner to those who are endeavoring
          to keep the commandments of God amidst a crooked and perverse nation among whom they shine as lights in the
          world. O how solemn, how fearfully solemn is this time for the youth among us who have had great light, ...
          that their words, spirit, and character shall not be misleading to those with whom they associate....</p>
      <p>“Take unto you the whole armour of God” (verse 13). Make your guide the Word. “Take” it. The whole armor which
          is furnished you in the Scriptures is all prepared for you to take. “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour
          of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore,
          having your loins girt about with truth” (verses 13, 14).</p>
      <p>Fiction, spurious interpretations of the Scriptures, dishes of fables, are everywhere presented for your
          acceptance. But great discernment is needed that the girdle should be the golden chain of truth. “And having
          on the breastplate of <nobr>righteousness”—not</nobr> your own, but the righteousness of Christ. This is the
          fortress of the soul. We may, with Christ’s righteousness going before us, withstand the moral darkness and
          penetrate the devices of the satanic agencies.<span class="ft11">6</span></p>
