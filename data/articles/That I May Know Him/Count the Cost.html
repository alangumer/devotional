    <h1>Count the Cost</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the
          gospel’s, the same shall save it. For what shall it proﬁt a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
          his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Mark <nobr>8:35-37.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus ... lifts up His voice to break the spell of infatuation upon human minds and asks the momentous
          question, “What shall it proﬁt a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” ...</p>
      <p>Disease and death are in our world, and how little we know when our individual probation shall end.... How</p>
      <p>many, if now called to render up their accounts, would do it with grief, regret, and remorse that their
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> probationary time was so fully employed in <nobr>self-serving!</nobr> The eternal
          interests of the soul have been fearfully neglected for unimportant affairs. The mind is kept busy, just as
          Satan designs it shall be, with selﬁsh interests and nothing of any consequence, and time may be passing into
          eternity without a ﬁtting up for heaven at all.</p>
      <p>What can be compared with the loss of a human soul? It is a question which every soul must determine for
          <nobr>himself—whether</nobr> to gain the treasures of eternal life or to lose all because of his neglect to
          make God and His righteousness his ﬁrst and only business. Jesus, the world’s Redeemer,... looks with grief
          upon the large number of those who profess to be Christians who are not serving Him but themselves. They
          scarcely think of eternal realities, notwithstanding He calls their attention to the rich reward awaiting the
          faithful who will serve Him with their undivided affections. He brings eternal realities within the range of
          their vision. He bids them to count the cost now of being an obedient and faithful follower of Christ, and
          says, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon” (Matthew 6:24).</p>
      <p>He would have every individual sense his responsibility to so use his precious time here in this world that it
          will be fruitful daily in good works. This is the only worthy aim of every living <nobr>mortal—to</nobr>
          employ his <nobr>God-given</nobr> faculties with endless results in view.<span class="ft11">14</span></p>
