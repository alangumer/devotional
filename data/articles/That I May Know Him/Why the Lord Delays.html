    <h1>Why the Lord Delays</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and
          a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is
          longsuffering to <nobr>us-ward,</nobr> not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
          repentance. 2 Peter 3:8, 9.</strong></p>
      <p>As I have labored since 1843 and 1844 I have felt so thankful that the Lord has permitted time to last to do
          more fully the missionary work that was needing to be done to warn our cities. O our wise heavenly Father made
          the inﬁnite sacriﬁce of His only begotten Son! He gave Him to our world that the world might, through the
          merciful provisions made, accept the <nobr>Word—Bible</nobr><nobr>truth—and</nobr> prepare for the great event
          of His coming. That which caused the believing church so much sorrow in their disappointment in the time of
          His coming has been a reason of thanksgiving for the delay. Now the angels of God are preparing the way for
          the truth to reach all nations.</p>
      <p>There are thousands in the cities, in the byways and the highways, to hear the warning message. Are we awake?
          Do we understand there is a world to have the warning? The cities are all to be worked diligently. We must
          arouse and do a great work. There are many more to hear the last warning message to a perishing world. We have
          no time to delay, for Satan is doing his best to destroy souls.</p>
      <p>I now praise God for His long and merciful forbearance. The message has been carried to many countries. It is a
          worldwide message. There is most diligent work to do to warn our cities. We have had opportunity to send the
          light to many thousands who have rejoiced in the truth and sacriﬁced their time and their means to build up
          the sanitariums and churches in all parts of America. Schools have been established and new ﬁelds are opening,
          many in new countries. The work at times has moved slowly.... It is for the need of the Holy Spirit that</p>
      <p>many more places are not hearing the last message of warning.... Angels are waiting to ﬁt up converted men
          and</p>
      <p>women to do this work if they will consecrate their whole heart, mind, and soul to the work. We have no time to
          lose.<span class="ft15">10</span></p>
