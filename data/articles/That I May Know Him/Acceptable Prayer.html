    <h1>Acceptable Prayer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples
          said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. Luke 11:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus taught His disciples to pray, and He often urged upon them the necessity of prayer. He did not bid them
          to study books to learn a form of prayer. They were not to offer prayer to men, but to make their requests
          known to God. He taught them that the prayer which God accepts is the simple, earnest petition from a soul
          that feels its need....</p>
      <p>God invites us to come to Him with our burden of guilt and our heart sorrows. Sin ﬁlls us with fear of God.
          When we have sinned we try to hide ourselves from Him. But whatever our sin, God bids us come unto Him through
          Jesus Christ. It is only by taking our sins to God that we can be freed from them. Cain, under the rebuke of
          God, acknowledged his guilt in killing Abel, but he ﬂed away from God, as if he could thus escape from his
          sin. Had he ﬂed to God with his burden of guilt he would have been forgiven. The prodigal son, realizing his
          guilt and wretchedness, said, “I will arise and go to my father” (Luke 15:18). He confessed his sin and was
          taken back to his father’s heart.</p>
      <p>If we would offer acceptable prayer, there is a work to be done in confessing our sins to one another. If I
          have sinned against my neighbor in word or action I should make confession to him. If he has wronged me he
          should confess to me. So far as is possible the one who has wronged another is to make restitution. Then in
          contrition he is to confess the sin to God, whose law has been transgressed. In sinning against our brother,
          we sin against God, and we must seek pardon from Him. Whatever our sin, if we but repent and believe in the
          atoning blood of Christ we shall be pardoned.... We have only one channel of approach to God. Our prayers can
          come to Him</p>
      <p>through one name <nobr>only—that</nobr> of the Lord Jesus, our advocate.<span class="ft15">12</span></p>
      <p>Christ is represented as stooping from His throne and bending earthward to send help to every needy soul who
          asks Him in faith.<span class="ft15">13</span></p>
