    <h1>An Abiding Place for You</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many
          mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a
          place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. John
          <nobr>14:1-3.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>When Christ lay in the tomb, His disciples called to mind these words. They pondered over them, and wept
          because they could not fathom the meaning of them. No faith and hope relieved the brokenhearted disciples.
          They could only repeat the words, “I will come again, and receive you unto myself....”</p>
      <p>Mansions are prepared for all who have subjected themselves in obedience to the divine law. And in order that
          the human family might have no excuse because of Satan’s temptations, Christ became one with them. The only
          Being who was one with God lived the law in humanity, descended to the lowly life of a common laborer, and
          toiled at the carpenter’s bench with His earthly parent. He lived the life which He requires of all who claim
          to be His children. Thus was cut off the powerful argument of Satan that God required of humanity a
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and subjection that He would not Himself render....</p>
      <p>Jesus asks no more of men than that they shall follow in His footsteps. He was the Majesty of heaven, the King
          of glory, but for our sakes He became poor that we through His poverty might be made rich. Almost His last
          words to us are, “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.” In the place of
          being sorrowful, your hearts troubled, you should rejoice. I came into the world for your sakes. My time here
          is now accomplished. I shall henceforth be in heaven. For your sakes I have been an interested worker in the
          world. In the future I shall be engaged just as devotedly in a more important work in your behalf. I came into
          the world to redeem you. I go to prepare an abiding place for you in My Father’s kingdom.<span

      <p>What a comfort these words should be to us! Think of the work Christ is now doing in
          <nobr>heaven—preparing</nobr> mansions for His children. He wants us to prepare to dwell in these
          mansions.<span class="ft15">29</span></p>
