    <h1>Triumph of God’s Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. Clouds and
          darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Psalm 97:1,
          2.</strong></p>
      <p>The law of love is the foundation of God’s government, and the service of love the only service acceptable to
          Heaven. God has granted freedom of will to all, endowed men with capacity to appreciate His character, and
          therefore with ability to love Him and to choose His service. So long as created beings worshiped God they
          were in harmony throughout the universe. While love to God was supreme, love to others abounded. As there was
          no transgression of the law, which is the transcript of God’s character, no note of discord jarred the
          celestial harmonies.</p>
      <p>But known unto God are all His works, and from eternal ages the covenant of grace (unmerited favor) existed in
          the mind of God. It is called the everlasting covenant, for the plan of salvation was not conceived after the
          fall of man, but it was that which was “kept in silence through times eternal, but now is manifested, and ...
          made known unto all the nations ...” (Romans 16:25, 26, R.V.)....</p>
      <p>Before Him who ruleth in the heavens the mysteries of the past and future are alike outspread, and God sees
          beyond the woe and darkness and ruin that sin has wrought, the outworking of His purpose of love and blessing.
          Though clouds and darkness are round about Him, yet righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His
          throne.... Through the plan of salvation a larger purpose is to be wrought out even than the salvation of
          man</p>
      <p>and the redemption of the earth. Through the revelation of the character of God in Christ, the beneﬁcence of
          the divine government would be manifested before the universe, the charge of Satan refuted, the nature and
          result of sin made plain, and the perpetuity of the law fully demonstrated.<span class="ft15">32</span></p>
      <p>Then the extermination of sin will vindicate God’s love and establish His honor before a universe of beings who
          delight to do His will, and in whose heart is His law.<span class="ft15">33</span></p>
