    <h1>The Babe of Bethlehem</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a
          sign unto you; Ye shall ﬁnd the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. Luke 2:11,
          12.</strong></p>
      <p>We cannot understand how Christ became a little, helpless babe. He could have come to earth in such beauty that
          He would have been unlike the sons of men. His face could have been bright with light, and His form could have
          been tall and beautiful. He could have come in such a way as to charm those who looked upon Him, but this was
          not the way that God planned He should come among the sons of men. He was to be like those who belonged to the
          human family and to the Jewish race. His features were to be like those of other human beings and He was not
          to have such beauty of person as to make people point Him out as different from others. He was to come as one
          of the human family, and to stand as a man before heaven and earth. He had come to take man’s place, to pledge
          Himself in man’s behalf, to pay the debt that sinners owed. He was to live a pure life on the earth, and show
          that Satan had told a falsehood when he claimed that the human family belonged to him forever, and that God
          could not take men out of his hands.</p>
      <p>Men ﬁrst beheld Christ as a babe, as a child. His parents were very poor, and He had nothing in this earth save
          that which the poor have. He passed through all the trials that the poor and lowly pass through from babyhood
          to childhood, from youth to manhood....</p>
      <p>The more we think about Christ’s becoming a babe here on earth, the more wonderful it appears. How can it be
          that the helpless babe in Bethlehem’s manger is still the divine Son of God? Though we cannot understand it,
          we can believe that He who made the worlds, for our sakes became a helpless babe. Though higher than any of
          the angels, though as great as the Father on the throne of heaven, He became one with us. In Him God and man
          became one, and it is in this fact that we ﬁnd the hope of our fallen race. Looking upon Christ in the ﬂesh,
          we look upon God in humanity and see in Him the brightness of divine glory, the express image of God the
          Father.<span class="ft22">41</span></p>
