    <h1>Light for Those Who Love Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Psalm 97:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ has left His Holy Spirit to be His representative in the world, to give celestial aid to every
          hungering, thirsting soul.... We are living in a most solemn period of this world’s history, but light is
          shining for those who</p>
      <p>will walk in the light....</p>
      <p>There are many who have not had the light, and they are not judged guilty. They mourn because of their human
          ignorance. They ﬁnd nothing satisfactory, and thirst for a knowledge of the only true God. They have an ideal
          of God in their minds and they desire to ﬁnd Him. He has entrusted light to His people to give to all those
          who are praying for light. He has sent forth His streams of salvation to refresh those who are athirst for a
          knowledge of truth, virtue, and holiness. To such we should speak as did the apostle Paul to the Athenians,
          “Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you” (Acts 17:23). Heavenly inspiration has come to
          men, and they have been entrusted with gospel truth, and have thereby been weighted with a solemn
          responsibility to devote their <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers to making God known to man. Christ says, “And
          this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent”
          (John 17:3)....</p>
      <p>Those who have the mind of Christ will “walk even as he walked.” They will live out the law of God, will feed
          upon Christ, be partakers of the divine nature, and stand as living sentinels for truth. In integrity of heart
          they will voice the cry, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the
          unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters
          ...” (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18)....</p>
      <p>God gives light to those who love light. He imparts truth to those who search for truth as for something of
          most precious value in order that they may impart light to those who are in the valley and the shadow of
          death.<span class="ft22">47</span></p>
