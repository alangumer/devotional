    <h1>In God’s Workshop</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
          sacriﬁces, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 2:5.</strong></p>
      <p>The Word of God has served as a mighty cleaver to separate the children of God from the world. As they are
          taken out of the quarry of the world they are as rough stones, unﬁt for a place in the glorious temple of God.
          But they are brought into the Lord’s workshop, to be hewed and squared and polished, that they may become
          precious, accepted stones. This work of preparation for the heavenly temple is going on continually during
          probationary time. We are naturally inclined to desire our own way and will, but when the transforming grace
          of Christ takes hold upon our hearts the inquiry of our souls is, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” When
          the Spirit of God works within us, we are led to will and to do of the Lord’s good pleasure, and there is
          obedience in heart and action....</p>
      <p>Christians are to be God’s noblemen, who will never grovel in bondage to the great adversary of souls, but will
          bind themselves to God, catching inspiration from Him whom they love, who is high and lifted up. The soul that
          loves God rises above the fog of doubt; he gains a bright, broad, deep, living experience, and becomes meek
          and Christlike. His soul is committed to God, hid with Christ in God. He will be able to stand the test of
          neglect, of abuse and contempt, because his Saviour has suffered all this. He will not become fretful and
          discouraged when difﬁculties press him, because Jesus did not fail or become discouraged. Every true Christian
          will be strong, not in the strength and merit of his good works, but in the righteousness of Christ, which
          through faith is imputed unto him.<span class="ft11">29</span></p>
      <p>We are to occupy some place in the Lord’s spiritual temple, and the important question is not as to whether you
          are a large or a small stone, but whether you have submitted yourself to God that He may polish you and make
          you emit light for His glory. If we are in the Lord’s temple we must emit light. Are we permitting the
          heavenly Builder to hew and square and polish us? Have we faith to rest in Him?<span
