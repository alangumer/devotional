      <p><strong>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set
          down with my Father in his throne. Revelation 3:21.</strong></p>
      <p>These are the words of our substitute and surety. He who is the divine Head of the church, the mightiest of
          conquerors, would point His followers to His life, His toils, His <nobr>self-denials,</nobr> His struggles and
          sufferings, through contempt, through rejection, ridicule, scorn, insult, mockery, falsehood, up the path of
          Calvary to the scene of the cruciﬁxion, that they might be encouraged to press on toward the mark for the
          prize and reward of the overcomer.<span class="ft11">7</span></p>
      <p>The plan of salvation is not appreciated as it should be. It is not discerned or comprehended. It is made
          altogether a cheap affair, whereas to unite the human with the divine required an exertion of
          Omnipotence....</p>
      <p>Christ, by clothing His divinity with humanity, elevates humanity in the scale of moral value to an inﬁnite
          worth. But what a condescension on the part of God and on the part of His only begotten Son, who was equal
          with the Father! ...</p>
      <p>So great has been the spiritual blindness of men that they have sought to make of none effect the Word of God.
          They have declared by their traditions that the great plan of redemption was devised in order to abolish and
          make of none effect the law of God, when Calvary is the mighty argument that proves the immutability of the
          precepts of Jehovah.... The state of the character must be compared with the great moral standard of</p>
      <p>righteousness. There must be a searching out of the peculiar sins which have been offensive to God, which have
          dishonored His name and quenched the light of His Spirit and killed the ﬁrst love from the soul....</p>
      <p>Victory is assured through faith and obedience.... The work of overcoming is not restricted to the age of
          the</p>
      <p>martyrs. The conﬂict is for us, in these days of subtle temptation to worldliness, to
          <nobr>self-security,</nobr> to indulgence of pride, covetousness, false doctrines, and immorality of life....
          Shall we stand before the proving of God?<span class="ft17">8</span></p>
