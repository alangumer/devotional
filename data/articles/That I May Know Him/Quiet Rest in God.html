    <h1>Quiet Rest in God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of
          thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast. Psalm 57:1.</strong></p>
      <p>I am so sorry that men who want to be obedient to God put so much conﬁdence in human sympathy and human help
          which disappoint so often. But God, the living God, is unchangeable. He is the same kind, tender, pitiful,
          loving Saviour today, yesterday, and forever. Satan is now working with all his might, and leaving no means
          untried to unsettle minds because they see men of long experience make mistakes. But Jesus is
          faultless....</p>
      <p>Make God your entire trust. Pray, pray, pray, pray in faith. Then trust the keeping of your soul to God. He
          will keep that which is committed to Him against that day.... Walk humbly with God. The Lord sees every
          sorrow,</p>
      <p>every grief, every trial that besets the human soul, and He knows how to apply the balm....</p>
      <p>In God you can do valiantly. Tell it to the Lord in prayer, talk it to the Lord by the way. “Thee I seek; Thee
          I will follow; Thee I will serve. Under the shadow of Thy wings will I abide. Command me as Thou wilt; I will
          obey Thy voice.” Yield always to the heavenly guidance. When trials come, possess your soul in patience. Wait
          on the Lord and have one purpose in view, to seek the eternal good of all those with whom you are connected,
          holding fast your integrity in the strength of your God. He will redeem His promise. Your bread shall be
          provided; your water shall be sure. This means not only temporal bread and water but the bread and water of
          eternal life.</p>
      <p>Stand in God. Work under the sweet inﬂuence of His grace. The truth of God sanctifying the heart of the
          believer guides his life. We may stand ﬁrmly and assuredly. If you make the face of clay your dependence you
          lean on a reed that has oft broken in your hand and will break. Trust fully, unwaveringly, in God. He is the
          wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. We may keep the conscience
          unsullied and in peace and quiet rest in God.<span class="ft11">22</span></p>
