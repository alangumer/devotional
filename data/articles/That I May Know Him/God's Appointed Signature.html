    <h1>God’s Appointed Signature</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the
          Lord your God. Ezekiel 20:20.</strong></p>
      <p>How shall we distinguish God’s true servants from the false prophets who Christ said should arise to deceive
          many? There is only one test of <nobr>character—the</nobr> law of Jehovah.</p>
      <p>The Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood to show that they were God’s property. So the
          children of God in this age will bear the signature God has appointed. They will place themselves in harmony
          with God’s holy law. A mark is placed upon every one of God’s people just as verily as a mark was placed over
          the doors of the Hebrew dwellings, to preserve the people from the general ruin. God declares, “I gave them my
          sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them” (Ezekiel 20:12).... There is no need for us to be
          deceived....</p>
      <p>Satanic agencies have made the earth a stage for horrors which no language can describe. War and bloodshed are
          carried on by nations claiming to be Christian. A disregard for the law of God has brought its sure result.
          The great conﬂict now being waged is not merely a strife of man against man. On one side stands the Prince of
          life, acting as man’s substitute and surety; on the other, the prince of darkness, with the fallen angels
          under his command....</p>
      <p>There will be a sharp conﬂict between those who are loyal to God and those who cast scorn upon His law. The
          church has joined hands with the world. Reverence to God’s law has been subverted. The religious leaders are
          teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. As it was in the days of Noah, so it is in this age of the
          world. But shall the prevalence of disloyalty and transgression cause those who have reverenced the law of God
          to have less respect for it, to unite with the powers of earth to make it void? The truly loyal will not be
          carried away by the current of evil. They will not throw scorn and contempt on that which God has set apart as
          holy. The test comes to every one. There are only two sides. On which side are you?<span
