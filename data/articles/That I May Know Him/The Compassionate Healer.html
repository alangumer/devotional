    <h1>The Compassionate Healer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he
          healed their sick. Matthew 14:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus, precious Saviour, never seemed to become weary of the importunities of the <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> souls
          and the sick with all kinds of diseases. “And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
          compassion toward them” (Mark 6:34). This means a great deal to the suffering ones. He identiﬁed His interest
          with theirs. He shared their burdens. He felt their fears. He had yearning pity that was pain to the heart of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>O what love, what matchless love! He has become one with us that He might share with humanity in all their
          experience. He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet was without sin. Humanity is not to be demerited
          as a cheap and common thing. Christ clothed His divinity with humanity that humanity might be clothed with the
          righteousness of Christ. Man is the object of His solicitude and great love.</p>
      <p><nobr>Redemption—O</nobr> how much is comprehended in the word! All who will consent to be redeemed are
          uplifted and sanctiﬁed, redeemed through Jesus Christ from all commonness and earthliness, and enabled to
          cooperate with God in the great work of salvation. Jesus accepted humanity and revealed in His own life and
          character what man may be even when, in the providence of God, he is placed in the poorest circumstances of
          life. He had not even a penny wherewith to pay the tax money exacted, and wrought a miracle to obtain the
          little sum.</p>
      <p>Jesus, precious Saviour, was homeless and often hungry. He had not where to lay His head. He was wearied oft.
          Humanity is honored because Jesus assumed humanity to reveal to the world what humanity may become. He came to
          bring life and immortality to light, to ﬁll the commonplace, homeliest pursuits of life with brightness. Jesus
          is bending over us, searching into our characters to see if His own character is reﬂected in us.<span
