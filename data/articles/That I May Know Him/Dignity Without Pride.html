    <h1>Dignity Without Pride</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.... My righteousness I hold fast,
          and</strong></p>
      <p>will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. Job <nobr>27:4-6.</nobr></p>
      <p>We should preserve the strictest chastity in thought, and word, and deportment. Let us remember that God sets
          our secret sins in the light of His countenance. There are thoughts and feelings suggested and aroused by
          Satan that annoy even the best of men, but if they are not cherished, if they are repulsed as hateful, the
          soul is not contaminated with guilt, and no other is deﬁled by their inﬂuence. O that we each might become a
          savor of life unto life to those around us!</p>
      <p>There is great need of a deeper appreciation of the holy truth of God. If all had a realization of the
          solemnity and weight of the message, many sins that are now carelessly committed would cease from among us. Is
          there not too often the common thought and communication mingled with the sacred themes of truth? Wherever
          this is done, the standard is lowered. Your example leads others to regard the truth lightly, and this is one
          of the greatest sins in the sight of God.</p>
      <p>It is the privilege of every one to so live that God will approve and bless him. You may be hourly in communion
          with Heaven; it is not the will of your heavenly Father that you should ever be under condemnation and
          darkness. It is not pleasing to God that you should demerit yourself. You should cultivate
          <nobr>self-respect</nobr> by living so that you will be approved by your own conscience, and before men and
          angels.</p>
      <p>It is not an evidence of true humility that you go with your head bowed down and your heart ﬁlled with thoughts
          of self. It is your privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame and
          remorse. “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
          ﬂesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans 8:1). While we should not think of ourselves more highly than we ought,
          the Word of God does not condemn a proper <nobr>self-respect.</nobr> As sons and daughters of God we should
          have a conscious dignity of character, in which pride and <nobr>self-importance</nobr> have no part<span
