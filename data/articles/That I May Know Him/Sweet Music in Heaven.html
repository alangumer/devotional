    <h1>Sweet Music in Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
          done it unto me. Matthew 25:40.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ says to His redeemed people, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
          the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I
          was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison,
          and ye came unto me” (Matthew <nobr>25:34-36)....</nobr></p>
      <p>Prayers, exhortation, and talk are cheap fruits, which are frequently tied on, but fruits that are manifested
          in good works, in caring for the needy, the fatherless, and widows, are genuine fruits, and grow naturally
          upon a good tree.... When hearts sympathize with hearts burdened with discouragement and grief, when the
          hand</p>
      <p>dispenses to the needy, when the naked are clothed, the stranger made welcome to a seat at your ﬁreside and to
          a place in your heart, angels are coming very near, and an answering strain is responded to in heaven. Every
          act, every deed of justice and mercy and benevolence, makes sweet music ring in heaven. The Father from His
          throne beholds and numbers them with His most precious treasures. “And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of
          hosts, when I make up my jewels.” ...</p>
      <p>Our heavenly Father lays blessings disguised in our pathway, which some will not touch for fear they will
          detract from their enjoyment. Angels are waiting to see if we embrace opportunities within our reach of doing
          <nobr>good—waiting</nobr> to see if we will bless others, that they in turn may bless us. The Lord Himself has
          made us to <nobr>differ—some</nobr> poor, some rich, some <nobr>afﬂicted—that</nobr> all may have an
          opportunity to develop a character. The poor are purposely permitted of God to be thus, that we might be
          tested and proved, and develop what is in our hearts.<span class="ft11">30</span></p>
      <p>Every merciful act done to the needy, the suffering, is counted as though it were done to Jesus Himself. When
          you succor the poor, sympathize with the afﬂicted and oppressed, and befriend the orphan, you bring yourselves
          into a closer relationship to Jesus.<span class="ft11">31</span></p>
