    <h1>The Glorious Reunion in Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall
          come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.... He is
          the</strong></p>
      <p>King of glory. Psalm <nobr>24:7-10.</nobr></p>
      <p>Christ came to earth as God in the guise of humanity. He ascended to heaven as the King of saints. His
          ascension was worthy of His exalted character. He went as one mighty in battle, a conqueror, leading captivity
          captive. He was attended by the heavenly host, amid shouts and acclamations of praise and celestial song....
          All</p>
      <p>heaven united in His reception.<span class="ft15">9</span></p>
      <p>The most precious fact to the disciples in the ascension of Jesus was that He went from them into heaven in the
          tangible form of their divine Teacher.... The last remembrance that the disciples were to have of their
          Lord</p>
      <p>was as the sympathizing Friend, the gloriﬁed Redeemer.... The brightness of the heavenly escort and the
          opening</p>
      <p>of the glorious gates of God to welcome Him were not to be discerned by mortal eyes.</p>
      <p>Had the track of Christ to heaven been revealed to the disciples in all its inexpressible glory, they could not
          have endured the sight. Had they beheld the myriads of angels, and heard the bursts of triumph from the
          battlements of heaven, as the everlasting doors were lifted up, the contrast between that glory and their own
          lives in a word of trial, would have been so great that they would hardly have been able to again take up the
          burden of their earthly lives....</p>
      <p>Their senses were not to become so infatuated with the glories of heaven that they would lose sight of the
          character of Christ on earth, which they were to copy in themselves. They were to keep distinctly before their
          minds the beauty and majesty of His life, the perfect harmony of all His attributes, and the mysterious union
          of the divine and human in His nature. It was better that the earthly acquaintance of the disciples with their
          Saviour should end in the solemn, quiet, and sublime manner in which it did. His visible ascent from the world
          was in harmony with the meekness and quiet of His life.”<span class="ft11">10</span></p>
