      <p><strong>For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. Psalm 119:89.</strong></p>
      <p>The Word of God covers a period of history reaching from the Creation to the coming of the Son of man in the
          clouds of heaven. Yea, more, it carries the mind forward to the future life, and opens before it the glories
          of Paradise restored. Through all these centuries the truth of God has remained the same. That which was truth
          in the beginning is truth now. Although new and important truths appropriate for succeeding generations have
          been opened to the understanding, the present revealings do not contradict those of the past. Every new truth
          understood only makes more signiﬁcant the old.<span class="ft11">14</span></p>
      <p>Commencing with the Fall, down through the patriarchal and Jewish ages even to the present time, there has been
          a gradual unfolding of the purposes of God in the plan of redemption. Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses
          understood the gospel through Christ; they looked for the salvation of the race through man’s substitute and
          surety. These holy men of old held communion with the Saviour who was to come to our world in human ﬂesh, and
          some of them talked with Christ and heavenly angels face to face, as a man talks with his friend.<span
          class="ft22">15</span></p>
      <p>As time has rolled on from Creation and the cross of Calvary, as prophecy has been and is still fulﬁlling,
          light and knowledge have greatly increased.... In the life and death of Christ, a light ﬂashes back upon the
          past,</p>
      <p>giving signiﬁcance to the whole Jewish economy, and making of the old and the new dispensations a complete
          whole. Nothing that God has ordained in the plan of redemption can be dispensed with. It is the working out of
          the divine will in the salvation of man.<span class="ft11">16</span></p>
      <p>All the truths of revelation are of value to us, and in contemplating things of eternal interest, we shall gain
          true perceptions of the character of God.... The entire character will be elevated and transformed. The soul
          will</p>
      <p>be brought into harmony with Heaven.<span class="ft15">17</span></p>
