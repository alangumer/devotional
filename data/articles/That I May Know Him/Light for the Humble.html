    <h1>Light for the Humble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. Psalm 25:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Anything like pride in learning and dependence upon scientiﬁc knowledge which you place between your soul and
          the word of the Bible will most effectually close the door of your heart to the sweet, humble religion of the
          meek and lowly Jesus....</p>
      <p>It is the humble in heart that receive the enlightenment of Heaven that is more precious than the boasted
          wisdom of the world.... He ... becomes spiritual, and discerns spiritual things. The wisdom of God enlightens
          his</p>
      <p>mind, and he beholds wondrous things out of God’s law. This salvation which offers pardon to the transgressor,
          presents to him the righteousness that will bear the scrutiny of the Omniscient One, gives victory over the
          powerful enemy of God and man, provides eternal life and joy for its receiver....</p>
      <p>It is the completeness of salvation that gives it its greatness. No man can measure or understand it by worldly
          wisdom. It may be contemplated with the most profound and concentrated study, but the mind loses itself in the
          untraceable majesty of its Author. But the soul united with God in meditation of His unfathomable riches is
          expanded, and becomes more capable of comprehending to a greater depth and height the glories of the plan of
          salvation.... His abilities develop and strengthen to comprehend and to do with increased skill and wisdom
          the</p>
      <p>requirements of God. The mind devoted unreservedly to God, under the guidance of the divine Spirit develops
          generally and harmoniously. The weak, vacillating character becomes changed through the power of God to one of
          strength and steadfastness. Continual devotion and piety establish so close a relation between Jesus and His
          disciple that the Christian becomes like Him in mind and character. After association with the Son of God the
          humble follower of Christ is found to be a person of sound principle, clear perception, and reliable judgment.
          He has a connection with God, the Source of light and understanding.<span class="ft17">41</span></p>
