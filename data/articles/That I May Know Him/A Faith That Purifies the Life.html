    <h1>A Faith That Puriﬁes the Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But thou, O man of God, ﬂee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
          patience, meekness. Fight the good ﬁght of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called,
          and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 1 Timothy 6:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>Many teach that all that is necessary to salvation is to believe in Jesus, but what saith the word of
          <nobr>truth?—“Faith</nobr> without works is dead” (James 2:26). We are to “ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith, lay
          hold on eternal life,” take up the cross, deny self, war against the ﬂesh, and follow daily in the footsteps
          of the Redeemer....</p>
      <p>It is a fatal mistake to think that there is nothing for you to do in obtaining salvation. You are to cooperate
          with the agencies of heaven. ... There is a cross to be lifted in the pathway, a wall to be scaled before you
          enter the eternal city, a ladder to be climbed before the gate of pearl is reached, and as you realize your
          inability and weakness and cry for help, a divine voice will come to you from the battlements of heaven
          saying, “Take hold of my strength” (Isaiah 27:5)....</p>
      <p>The controversy that was waged between Christ and Satan is renewed over every soul that leaves the black banner
          of the prince of darkness to march under the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Prince Emmanuel. The evil
          one will present the most subtle allurements to draw those away from their allegiance who would be true to
          Heaven, but we must yield all the powers of our being into the service of God, and then we shall be kept from
          falling into the snares of the enemy....</p>
      <p>Any course of action that weakens your physical or mental power unﬁts you for the service of your Creator. We
          are to love God with all our hearts, and if we have an eye single to His glory we shall eat, drink, and clothe
          ourselves with reference to His divine will. Every one who has a realizing sense of what it means to be a
          Christian will purify himself from everything that weakens and deﬁles. All the habits of his life will be
          brought into harmony with the requirements of the Word of truth, and he will not only believe, but will work
          out his own salvation with fear and trembling, while submitting to the molding of the Holy Spirit.<span
