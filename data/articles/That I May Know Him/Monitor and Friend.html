    <h1>Monitor and Friend</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew
          thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. Deuteronomy 32:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Life is like a voyage. We have storm and sunshine, but we bear in mind that we are nearing the desired haven.
          We shall soon be beyond the storms and tempests. Our present duty is to hearken to the voice that says, “Learn
          of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart” (Matthew 11:29). We must accept this invitation daily. The past is
          contained in the book where all things are written down. We cannot blot out the record, but we can learn many
          things if we choose. The past should teach us its lessons. As we make the past our monitor, we may also make
          it our friend. As we call to mind that in the past which has been disagreeable, let it teach us not to repeat
          it. In the future let nothing be traced which will cause regret in the <nobr>by-and-by.</nobr> We may now
          avoid a bad showing. Every day we live we are making our history. Today is ours, yesterday is beyond our
          amendment or control. Then let us not grieve the Spirit of God today, for tomorrow we shall not be able to
          recall this day; it will be yesterday to us....</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ has plentiful help and grace for all who will appreciate it. The Lord is our helper; with Him is
          forgiveness. He alone can blot out the sins of the past. He can strengthen the mind. If we regard the past as
          no longer our enemy but as a friend to warn us off the ground we should not approach, it will prove a true
          friend....</p>
      <p>Will we grasp and appreciate the good, and refuse the evil? Will we walk humbly with God? ... We must not fail
          nor be discouraged; then the present work, now passing beyond our control, will be our paymaster....</p>
      <p>We have only a little period in which to work. We are not to educate ourselves to worry. Keep the eye upward,
          ﬁxed upon the mark of our high calling in Christ Jesus. We have a work to do; let us do it as in the sight of
          the whole universe of heaven. We are not to faint, to stumble on in unbelief. God desires us to look to Him as
          our sufﬁciency and strive to be complete in Him.<span class="ft11">31</span></p>
