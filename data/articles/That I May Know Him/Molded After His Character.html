    <h1>Molded After His Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
          from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18.</strong></p>
      <p>When a man turns away from human imperfections and beholds Jesus, a divine transformation takes place in his
          character. He ﬁxes his eye upon Christ as on a mirror which reﬂects the glory of God, and by beholding he
          becomes changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord....</p>
      <p>Turn your eyes from the imperfections of others and ﬁx them steadfastly on Christ. With a contrite heart, study
          His life and character. You need not only to be more enlightened, but quickened, that you may see the banquet
          that is before you, and eat and drink the ﬂesh and blood of the Son of God, which is His Word. By tasting the
          good Word of Life, by feeding on the Bread of Life, you may see the power of a world to come, and be created
          anew in Christ Jesus. If you receive His gifts you will be renewed unto holiness, and His grace will bring
          forth in you fruit unto the glory of God.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit reveals Christ to the mind, and faith takes hold of Him. If you accept Christ as your personal
          Saviour, you will know by experience the value of the great sacriﬁce made in your behalf upon the cross of
          Calvary. The Spirit of Christ working upon the heart conforms it to His image, for Christ is the model upon
          which the Spirit works. By the ministry of His Word, by His providences, by His inward working, God stamps the
          likeness of Christ upon the soul.</p>
      <p>To possess Christ is your ﬁrst work, and to reveal Him as One who is able to save to the uttermost all who come
          to Him is your next work. To serve the Lord with full purpose of heart is to honor and glorify His name by
          dwelling upon holy things, by having a mind ﬁlled with the vital truths revealed in His Holy Word....</p>
      <p>Goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience, and love are the attributes of Christ’s character. If you have the
          spirit of Christ, your character will be molded after His character.<span class="ft15">38</span></p>
