    <h1>The Greatest Service</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath
          forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.</strong></p>
      <p>The greatest service we can render to the cause of God, and which will reﬂect steady beams of light upon the
          pathway of others, is to be patient, kind, steadfast as a rock to principle, <nobr>God-fearing.</nobr> This
          will constitute us the salt of the earth, the light of the world. We shall be often disappointed, for we shall
          not ﬁnd perfection in those who are connected with us, and they will not see perfection in us. It is only by
          agonizing effort on our part that we shall become unselﬁsh, humble, childlike, teachable, meek and lowly of
          heart, like our divine Lord. We must bring our hearts and minds up to a high point of education in spiritual
          and heavenly things.</p>
      <p>This world is not heaven, but it is the workshop of God for the ﬁtting up of His people for a pure and holy
          paradise. And while each one of us is to feel that he is a part of the great web of humanity, he must not
          expect that others in that web will be without a ﬂaw any more than himself. Mistakes will be made, and if the
          erring are willing to be corrected, a valuable experience is gained, so that their defeat is turned to
          victory. You should consider that many of your own errors are not brought to light, and be careful not to make
          the mistakes and imperfection of others appear in their worst light, either to yourself or to others. No man
          is perfect, and unjust criticism indulged towards others is not wise or Christlike....</p>
      <p>We have a serious, solemn work to do for ourselves to cleanse our own souls from spot and stain if we will
          stand before the Son of man when He shall appear, acquitted of Him. We must be educators as well as reformers.
          To cut loose from every one who errs and does not follow our own ideas is not doing as Christ is doing for us.
          We are all fallible, and we need pity, forbearance, kindly consideration, and sympathetic love for those with
          whom we are connected. We are all unworthy of the love and conﬁdence of God.<span class="ft17">40</span></p>
