    <h1>The Christian Race</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may
          obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a
          corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 1 Corinthians 9:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>Here Paul makes a sharp contrast, to put to shame the feeble efforts of professed Christians who plead for
          their selﬁsh indulgences, and refuse to place themselves by <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and strictly temperate
          habits in a position that they will make a success of overcoming. All who entered the list in the public games
          were animated and excited by the hope of a prize if they were successful. In like manner a prize is held out
          before the Christian, the reward of faithfulness to the end of the race.... All ran in the race, but only one
          received the prize. The other</p>
      <p>strugglers for the perishable laurel wreath, however thorough their preparation, however earnest and determined
          their efforts, were doomed to failure. It is not so with the Christian race.... The weakest saint as well as
          the</p>
      <p>strongest may obtain the crown of immortal glory if he is thoroughly in earnest and will submit to privation
          and loss for Christ’s sake....</p>
      <p>If we create unnatural appetites and indulge them in any degree we violate nature’s laws, and enfeebled
          physical, mental, and mortal conditions will result. We are hence unﬁtted for that persevering, energetic, and
          hopeful effort which we might have made had we been true to nature’s laws. If we injure a single organ of the
          body we rob God of the service we might render to Him.<span class="ft11">6</span></p>
      <p>The apostle calls our attention to the care and diligence which were required to secure the victory in these
          ancient games. He exhorts all who start in the Christian race to give all diligence to make success certain,
          while he presents before them for their encouragement the crown of glory which the righteous Judge will award
          to all who are faithful to the end of the race.... This crown is not a perishable chaplet of ﬂowers, but the
          glorious crown</p>
      <p>of everlasting life, which awaits all who, having completed the Christian race, love the appearing of our
          Lord.<span class="ft15">7</span></p>
