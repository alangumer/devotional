    <h1>The Proof of Our Discipleship</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. John
          13:35.</strong></p>
      <p>There is nothing that can so weaken the inﬂuence of the church as the lack of love....The people of the
          world</p>
      <p>are looking to us to see what our faith is doing for our characters and lives. They are watching to see if it
          is having a sanctifying effect on our hearts, if we are becoming changed into the likeness of Christ. They are
          ready to discover every defect in our lives, every inconsistency in our actions. Let us give them no occasion
          to reproach our faith.</p>
      <p>It is not the opposition of the world that will most endanger us; it is the evil cherished right in our midst
          that works our most grievous disaster. It is the unconsecrated lives of halfhearted professors that retard the
          work of the truth and bring darkness upon the church of God.</p>
      <p>There is no surer way of weakening ourselves in spiritual things than to be envious, suspicious of one another,
          full of faultﬁnding and evil surmising....</p>
      <p>When you are associated together, be guarded in your words.... If the love of the truth is in your heart
          you</p>
      <p>will talk of the truth. You will talk of the blessed hope that you have in Jesus. If you have love in your
          heart you will seek to establish and build up your brother in the most holy faith. If a word is dropped that
          is detrimental to the character of your friend or brother, do not encourage this evil speaking. It is the work
          of the enemy. Kindly remind the speaker that the Word of God forbids that kind of conversation. We are to
          empty the heart of everything that deﬁles the soul temple, that Christ may dwell within. Our Redeemer has told
          us how we may reveal Him to the world. If we cherish His spirit, if we manifest His love to others, if we
          guard one another’s interests, if we are kind, patient, forbearing, the world will have an evidence by the
          fruits we bear that we are the children of God. It is the unity in the church that enables it to exert a
          conscious inﬂuence upon unbelievers and worldlings.<span class="ft11">34</span></p>
