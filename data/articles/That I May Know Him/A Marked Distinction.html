    <h1>A Marked Distinction</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the
          evil. John 17:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Christians are to stand out distinct from the world as God’s standard bearers, showing in their lives the
          inﬂuence of the transforming grace of Christ. They are raised up together to sit with Christ in heavenly
          places that they may reveal to the world, to angels, and to men an enduring representation of the eternal
          world. They are to hold forth the Word of life, warning men of the binding claims of God’s law. God wants His
          servants to be of a high order. He wants them to obey laws of a higher order than the laws of the
          <nobr>world—laws</nobr> which are the transcript of His character.</p>
      <p>God’s work is supreme. He calls for all the powers of the intellect, all the spiritual endowments. They are to
          be consecrated to Him and to the service of humanity. He calls for workers who are partakers of the divine
          nature. Those who really believe in Jesus will be colaborers with Him, showing to the unfallen worlds and to
          the fallen world a character which is after the divine similitude. They are to show that they have a higher,
          holier order of enjoyment than the world can bestow. God will bestow the power of the Holy Spirit upon all who
          will cooperate with Him in the cultivation of all their endowments and talents, that they may stand on vantage
          ground....</p>
      <p>Christ’s followers are to seek to improve the moral tone of the world, under the inﬂuence of the impartation of
          the Spirit of God. They are not to come down to the world’s level, thinking that by doing this they will
          uplift it. In words, in dress, in spirit, in everything, there is to be a marked distinction between
          Christians and worldlings. This distinction has a convincing inﬂuence upon worldlings. They see that the sons
          and daughters of the Lord do separate themselves from the world, and that the Lord binds them up with
          Himself.... “And God hath both</p>
      <p>raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power” (1 Corinthians 6:14). Who is willing to be
          raised to the highest level?<span class="ft15">35</span></p>
