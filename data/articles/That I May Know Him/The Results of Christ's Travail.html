    <h1>The Results of Christ’s Travail</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisﬁed: by his knowledge shall my righteous
          servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Isaiah 53:11.</strong></p>
      <p>What sustained the Son of God during His life of toil and sacriﬁce? He saw the results of the travail of His
          soul, and was satisﬁed. Looking into eternity, He beheld the happiness of those who through His humiliation
          had received pardon and everlasting life. His ear caught the shout of the redeemed. He heard the ransomed ones
          singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.<span class="ft11">38</span></p>
      <p>“God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
          but have everlasting life.” During every moment of Christ’s life in our world, God was repeating His gift.
          Christ, the sinless One, was making an inﬁnite sacriﬁce for sinners, that they might be saved. He came as a
          man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and those for whom He came looked upon Him as stricken, smitten of
          God, and afﬂicted. The cup of suffering was placed in His hand, as if He were the guilty one, and He drained
          it to the dregs. He bore the sin of the world to the bitter end.... No line can fathom, no measurement
          compute, the</p>
      <p>love revealed by the cross of Calvary....</p>
      <p>In every pang of anguish endured we behold the throes of paternal love. The Father Himself travailed in the
          greatness of His almighty love in behalf of a world perishing in sin. By the sacriﬁce that has been made, the
          gift of eternal life has been placed within the reach of every son and daughter of Adam.<span

      <p>Christ’s redeemed ones are His jewels, His precious and peculiar treasure. “They shall be as the stones of a
          <nobr>crown”—“the</nobr> riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints” (Zechariah 9:16; Ephesians
          1:18). In them “he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisﬁed.” Christ looks upon His people
          in their purity and perfection as the reward of all His sufferings, His humiliation, and His love, and the
          supplement of His <nobr>glory—Christ</nobr> the great center, from whom radiates all glory.<span
