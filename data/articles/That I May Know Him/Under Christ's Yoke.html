    <h1>Under Christ’s Yoke</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto
          your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Matthew 11:29, 30.</strong></p>
      <p>The tempter often whispers that the Christian life is one of exaction, of rigorous duties, that it is hard to
          be on the watch continually, and there is no need of being so particular. It was thus that he deceived and
          overthrew Eve in Eden, telling her that God’s commands were arbitrary and unjust.... Satan’s object is the
          same now as</p>
      <p>then. He desires to deceive and ruin us. We should study the life of Christ and seek to cherish His spirit and
          copy His example, and the more we become like Him, the more clearly shall we discern the temptation of Satan,
          and the more successfully resist his power....</p>
      <p>True happiness is to be found, not in <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> and <nobr>self-pleasing,</nobr> but in
          learning of Christ, taking His yoke, and bearing His burden. Those who trust to their own wisdom and follow
          their own ways, go complaining at every step, because the burden which selﬁshness binds upon them is so heavy
          and its yoke so galling. They might change all this if they would but come to Jesus and by His grace put off
          the yoke that links them to Satan,</p>
      <p>... take the burden which Christ gives them, and let His yoke bind them to Him in willing, happy service.</p>
      <p>Jesus loves the young, and He longs to have them possess that peace which He alone can impart.... If we</p>
      <p>have become the disciples of Christ we shall be learning of <nobr>Him—every</nobr> day learning how to overcome
          some unlovely trait of character, every day copying His example and coming a little nearer the Pattern. If we
          are ever to inherit those mansions that He has gone to prepare for us we must here be forming such characters
          as the dwellers there are to possess.<span class="ft11">36</span></p>
      <p>The requirements of God are made in wisdom and goodness. In obeying them, the mind enlarges, the character
          improves, and the soul ﬁnds a peace and rest that the world can neither give nor take away. When the heart is
          fully surrendered to Jesus, His ways will be found to be ways of pleasantness and peace.<span
