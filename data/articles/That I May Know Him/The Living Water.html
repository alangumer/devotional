    <h1>The Living Water</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them:
          and that Rock was Christ. 1 Corinthians 10:4.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ combines the two types. He is the rock, He is the living water.</p>
      <p>The same beautiful and expressive ﬁgures are carried throughout the Bible. Centuries before the advent of
          Christ, Moses pointed to Him as the rock of Israel’s salvation; the psalmist sung of Him as “my redeemer,”
          “the rock of my strength,” “the rock that is higher than I,” “a rock of habitation,” “rock of my heart,” “rock
          of my refuge.” In David’s song His grace is pictured also as the cool, “still waters,” amid green pastures,
          beside which the heavenly Shepherd leads His ﬂock. Again, “Thou shalt make them,” he says, “drink of the river
          of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life.” And the wise man declares, “The wellspring of wisdom
          as a ﬂowing brook.” To Jeremiah, Christ is “the fountain of living waters”; to Zechariah, “a fountain opened
          ... for sin and for uncleanness.”</p>
      <p>Isaiah describes Him as the “rock of ages,” and “the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.” And he records
          the precious promise, bringing vividly to mind the living stream that ﬂowed for Israel: “When the poor and
          needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God
          of Israel will not forsake them.” “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and ﬂoods upon the dry ground”;
          “in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.” The invitation is given, “Ho, every one
          that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” And in the closing pages of the sacred word this invitation is echoed.
          The river of the water of life, “clear as crystal,” proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb; and the
          gracious call is ringing down through the ages, “Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”<span
