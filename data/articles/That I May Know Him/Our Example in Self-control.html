    <h1>Our Example in Self-control</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when
          he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. 1 Peter 2:22,
          23.</strong></p>
      <p>The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian is <nobr>self-control.</nobr> We should copy the example of
          Jesus, for when He was reviled, He reviled not again, but “committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.”
          Our Redeemer met insult and mockery with uncomplaining silence. All the cruel taunts of the murderous throng
          who exulted in His humiliation and trial in the judgment hall could not bring from Him one look or word of
          resentment or impatience. He was the Majesty of heaven, and in His pure breast there dwelt no room for the
          spirit of retaliation, but only for pity and love.<span class="ft11">16</span></p>
      <p>There seems to be a mist before the eyes of many, for they fail to discern spiritual things, and do not
          recognize the workings of Satan to entrap their souls. Christians are not to be the slaves of passion; they
          are to be controlled by the Spirit of God. But many become the sport of the enemy, because when temptation
          comes, they do not rest in Jesus, but worry themselves out of His arms.... We make failures in our little,
          daily difﬁculties, and allow</p>
      <p>them to irritate and vex us; we fall under them, and so make stumbling blocks for ourselves and others. But
          blessings of the greatest importance are to result from the patient endurance of these daily vexations, for we
          are to gain strength to bear greater difﬁculties....</p>
      <p>O that we might control our words and actions! ... What harm is wrought in the family circle by the utterance
          of impatient words, for the impatient utterance of one leads another to retort in the same spirit and manner.
          Then come words of retaliation, words of <nobr>self-justiﬁcation,</nobr> and it is by such words that a heavy,
          galling yoke is manufactured for your neck, for all these bitter words will come back in a baleful harvest to
          your soul.... How</p>
      <p>much better to have the oil of grace in the heart, to be able to pass by all provocation, and bear all things
          with Christlike meekness and forbearance.<span class="ft15">17</span></p>
