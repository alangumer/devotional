    <h1>Exalting the Man of Calvary</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that
          whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. John 3:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>I point you to the cross of Calvary. I ask you to consider the inﬁnite sacriﬁce made in your behalf that
          through faith in Jesus Christ you may not perish but have everlasting life.... I point you to Jesus. You are
          safe</p>
      <p>in committing to Him the innermost working of your mind. The Lord Jesus hath purchased you with an inﬁnite
          price. You may commit the keeping of your soul to Jesus. You may trust Him as your Counselor....
          Constantly</p>
      <p>draw nigh unto God. He will help you.</p>
      <p>O be sure you receive your illumination from the Source of all light. He is the great central Light of the
          universe of heaven and the great Light of the world. He will enlighten every man that cometh into the world.
          Reach no cheap, low standard. Cultivate the gentleness of Christ. Secure the highest attainments, and draw
          your inspiration from Jesus Christ. He is your Friend. You may always depend upon Him and ﬁnd Him faithful and
          true. When you need His sympathy in your greatest perplexity, wounded and bruised, He will not pass you by on
          the other side. To Him you may come in the simplicity of children. To Him you may come with joy and rejoicing.
          With everything that is ﬂattering to your hopes, every success which attends your labors in the Lord, look up
          to Jesus and lay every honor at His feet. Everything depends upon your walking in all humility of mind. Write
          the name of Christ upon your banner and never dishonor your colors.</p>
      <p>All heaven was given to us in Christ Jesus.... O honor Jesus by giving to Him the heart’s best and holiest</p>
      <p>services! He has given His life for you. Who is He that hath done this? The only begotten Son of God, He that
          was One with the Father before the world was.</p>
      <p>Lift up your banner, lift it up higher. Never, never let it trail in the dust of the earth. Exalt Jesus. Lift
          Him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and still higher.<span class="ft15">1</span></p>
