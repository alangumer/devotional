    <h1>Work Where You Are</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they
          went their way. Matthew 20:4.</strong></p>
      <p>There must be those who will come into the harvest ﬁeld and who will be workers without expecting their wages
          in this world. In the next world they will be abundantly rewarded. There are men and women who have been
          letting their talents rust with inaction, ... who could do a most precious work and grow in grace and
          capability to work by doing their best in accepting the work just where they are. They can single out
          <nobr>individuals—their</nobr><nobr>neighbors—and</nobr> give them personal labor....</p>
      <p>The Lord will investigate the use we have made of the talents He has entrusted to us. He has paid the wages of
          His own blood and His own <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and sacriﬁce and sufferings, to secure the willing service
          of every soul as a laborer together with God. If only all felt their accountability to God wisely to employ
          the gifts in talents entrusted, what a revenue would be brought to God through Jesus Christ! The one talent
          may and will increase by use. The supposed lowliest gift, the humblest service, may reach minds and inﬂuence
          hearts that those who possess larger talents could not touch.</p>
      <p>Now, now, now is our most favorable time to work. Individual visitation is of great value. In love for Jesus
          Christ and love for human souls the truth is to be carried to every family, talked of by every ﬁreside that it
          is possible for you to ﬁnd access to.... Bear in mind that the Holy Spirit is the worker. The human agent
          working</p>
      <p>for God is not alone....</p>
      <p>Labor in perseverance, in tenderness, compassion, prayerfulness, and love will do more than sermons. The Lord
          Jesus, in giving His life for the saving of the world from the curse of sin, intended greater things than our
          eyes have yet witnessed. The Holy Spirit is waiting for channels through whom to work.... Satan will not
          always</p>
      <p>triumph. The Spirit of God will be poured out upon the church just as soon as the vessels are prepared to
          receive it.<span class="ft15">25</span></p>
