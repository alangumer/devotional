    <h1>Fragrant With Heaven’s Blessing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his
          works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not
          against the truth. James 3:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>What is lying against the truth? It is claiming to believe the truth while the spirit, the words, the
          deportment, represent not Christ but Satan. To surmise evil, to be impatient and unforgiving, is lying against
          the truth, but love, patience, and long forbearance are in accordance with the principles of truth. Truth is
          ever pure, ever kind, breathing a heavenly fragrance unmingled with selﬁshness....</p>
      <p>To be unkind, to denounce others, to give expression to harsh, severe judgments, to entertain evil thoughts, is
          not the result of that wisdom which is from above.... The language of the Christian must be mild and
          circumspect,</p>
      <p>for his holy faith requires him to represent Christ to the world. All those who abide in Christ will manifest
          the kind, forgiving courtesy that characterized His life. Their works will be works of piety, equity, and
          purity. They will have the meekness of wisdom, and will exercise the gift of the grace of Jesus.<span

      <p>“Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, ... and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly
          in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
          grace in your hearts to the Lord” (Colossians 3:15, 16). This was Christ’s practice. He was often assailed by
          temptation, but in place of yielding or being provoked, He sang God’s praises. With spiritual songs He stopped
          the ﬂuent speech of those whom Satan was using to create strife....</p>
      <p>When those who love God are tempted, let them sing the praises of their Creator rather than speak words of
          accusing or faultﬁnding. The Lord will bless those who thus try to make peace. Trust in God. Be careful not to
          give the enemy any advantage by your unguarded words. Keep looking to Jesus. He is your strength....</p>
      <p>Be so considerate, so tender, so compassionate, that the atmosphere surrounding you will be fragrant with
          Heaven’s blessing.<span class="ft15">39</span></p>
