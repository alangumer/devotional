    <h1>Sowing and Reaping</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that
          soweth to his ﬂesh shall of the ﬂesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit
          reap life everlasting. Galatians 6:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>What is it to sow to the ﬂesh? It is to follow the desires and inclinations of our own natural hearts. Whatever
          may be our profession, if we are serving self instead of God we are sowing to the ﬂesh. The Christian life is
          a life of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and cross bearing. We are to endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus
          Christ.... We cannot</p>
      <p>inquire, What is for our convenience? but only, What are our orders? No one looks upon the life of a soldier as
          a life of <nobr>self-pleasing</nobr> and gratiﬁcation. We are on the battleﬁeld today, and two great forces
          are ever contending for the mastery....</p>
      <p>What are you sowing in your daily life? Are you sowing to your ﬂesh? Are you thinking only of your pleasure,
          your convenience? sowing to pride and vanity and ambition? ... I entreat you to sow to the Spirit. Every
          temptation resisted will give you power to sow to the Spirit in another time of trial.<span
          class="ft11">35</span></p>
      <p>If you are sowing faith, rendering obedience to Christ, you will reap faith and power for future obedience. If
          you are seeking to be a blessing to others, God will bless you.... The joy we give to others will be reﬂected
          upon</p>
      <p>us again, for as we sow, we shall reap....</p>
      <p>Abundant provision has been made that all who desire to live a godly life may have grace and strength through
          Jesus our divine Redeemer. The Christian’s life is not to be one of burdens and cares, although the cross must
          be lifted and the burdens borne; for the servants of God are to draw peace and strength from the Source of
          their strength, and in so doing they will ﬁnd life full of happiness and peace.... The whole being must
          be</p>
      <p>consecrated to God, for our precious Saviour never shares a divided heart. Our inclinations and desires must be
          under the control of the Spirit of God, and then we shall be strengthened to ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. We
          should daily ask, What are the Captain’s orders?<span class="ft11">36</span></p>
