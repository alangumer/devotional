    <h1>The Sin God Cannot Forgive</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy
          against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. Matthew 12:31.</strong></p>
      <p>“The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). No matter how sinful a person has
          been, no matter what his position may be, if he will repent and believe, coming unto Christ and trusting Him
          as his personal Saviour, he may be saved unto the uttermost....</p>
      <p>I know the danger of those who refuse to walk in the light as God gives it. They bring upon themselves the
          terrible crisis of being left to follow their own ways, to do after their own judgment. The conscience becomes
          less and less impressible. The voice of God seems to become more and more distant, and the wrongdoer is left
          to his own infatuation. In stubbornness he resists every appeal, despises all counsel and advice, and turns
          from every provision made for his salvation.... The Spirit of God no longer exerts a restraining power over
          him, and</p>
      <p>the sentence is passed, “He is joined to idols; let him alone” (see Hosea 4:17).... This is the process
          through</p>
      <p>which the soul passes that rejects the working of the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>No one need look upon the sin against the Holy Ghost as something mysterious and indeﬁnable. The sin against
          the Holy Ghost is the sin of persistent refusal to respond to the invitation to repent. If you refuse to
          believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour... , you love the atmosphere that surrounded the ﬁrst great
          apostate. You choose this atmosphere rather than the atmosphere that surrounds the Father and the Son, and God
          allows you to have your choice. But let no soul be discouraged by this presentation of the matter. Let no one
          who is striving to do the will of the Master be cast down.<span class="ft17">35</span></p>
      <p>Come with your whole heart to Jesus. Repent of your sins, make confession to God, forsake all iniquity, and you
          may appropriate to yourself all His promises. “Look unto me, and be ye saved” (Isaiah 45:22) is His gracious
          invitation.<span class="ft11">36</span></p>
