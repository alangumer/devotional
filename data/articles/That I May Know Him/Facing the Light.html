    <h1>Facing the Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thy whole body therefore be
          full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle
          doth give thee light. Luke 11:35, 36.</strong></p>
      <p>The moment the eye is turned from Jesus, darkness is seen, darkness is felt, for Jesus only is light and life
          and peace and assurance forever. “If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light”
          (Matthew 6:22).... What is it to have a single eye? It is to have a disposition to look upon Christ, for by
          beholding we</p>
      <p>become changed from glory to glory, from character to character.</p>
      <p>As we keep Christ in view, the bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon us and ﬂood the chambers of
          the mind and heart and ﬁll the soul temple with light. As the Light of the world shines upon us, we diffuse it
          to those around “as when the bright shining of a candle doth give ... light.” The soul that is stayed upon God
          commits to Christ all that perplexes, all that annoys, all that gives anxiety. The light of Christ shines in
          the soul in all goodness and peace, for in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily....</p>
      <p>Those who behold Christ will never plead that their own will may be done, or that their old ways and habits may
          be left undisturbed. As they behold Jesus, His image becomes engraved on heart and soul, and in all their
          practices they reﬂect His example upon the world. Day by day the hands, the feet, the tongue, follow the
          dictates of the spiritual nature, and faith makes their path a path that grows brighter and brighter unto the
          perfect day. Everything that keeps us from attaining unto the likeness of Christ is working out for us eternal
          loss. Then let no one plead for a continuance of his own way. Let no one seek to excuse his deﬁciencies of
          character by saying, It is “my way.” Cooperate with Jesus Christ and you will see that your own way is a way
          full of deﬁciency and fault, and that if it is not corrected it will cause you to put into your character
          building traits that will be as rotten timbers.... Let nothing of these defects of character be found in your
          building. Build on the rock Christ Jesus.<span class="ft22">5</span></p>
