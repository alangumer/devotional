    <h1>He is Coming Again!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall
          be. Revelation 22:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Was Christ a false prophet when He uttered these words? More than eighteen hundred years have passed since John
          heard this great truth, and the Lord has not yet come to reign. But shall we give up looking for His
          appearance? Shall we say, “My Lord delayeth his coming”?<span class="ft11">8</span></p>
      <p>“And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands
          of his saints” (Jude 14).... The doctrine of Christ’s coming was made known at this early date to the</p>
      <p>man who walked with God in continual communion. The godly character of this prophet is to represent the state
          of holiness to which the people of God must attain who expect to be translated to heaven....</p>
      <p>Shall we say we have been deceived in regard to the doctrine of Christ’s near coming? ... Shall we say that all
          our work to make ready a people prepared for His coming has been for nought? Never.... “Let us</p>
      <p>hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; ... and let us consider one another to
          <nobr>provoke”—unto</nobr> doubts and unbelief, and apostasy? No, but “unto love and to good works: not
          forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, ... but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see
          the day approaching” (Hebrews <nobr>10:23-25).</nobr></p>
      <p>We must have a knowledge of the Scriptures, that we may trace down the lines of prophecy and ... see that the
          day is approaching, so that with increased zeal and effort we may exhort one another to faithfulness....</p>
      <p>Give up our faith? lose our conﬁdence? become impatient? No, no. We will not think of such a thing.... See</p>
      <p>how the speciﬁcations of the prophecies have been and are fulﬁlling. Let us lift up our heads and rejoice, for
          our redemption draweth nigh. It is nearer than when we ﬁrst believed. Shall we not wait patiently, ﬁlled with
          courage and faith? Shall we not make ready a people to stand in the day of ﬁnal reckoning?<span
