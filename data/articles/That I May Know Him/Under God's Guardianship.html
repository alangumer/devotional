    <h1>Under God’s Guardianship</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy
          shade upon thy right hand.... The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
          Psalm</strong></p>
      <p><nobr>121:4-7.</nobr></p>
      <p>[Early morning diary entries.] July 16, 1897. I awakened this morning at three o’clock and lifted my heart in
          prayer and thanksgiving to God for His watchful care over the household. I pray the Lord to take us all under
          His guardianship today and make His face to shine upon us. I pray most earnestly that He will honor our humble
          dwelling with His abiding presence in our home. We may every individual in the family have the converting
          power of God daily upon heart and character.</p>
      <p>The religion of Christ in the heart is the wellspring of life. It is the living water that Christ will give to
          every thirsting soul that asks Him. There are many who keep religion in practice far from the soul temple, and
          their faith is not in Jesus Christ.... The heavenly Guest should be invited to occupy the throne of the soul,
          to control</p>
      <p>every impulse of the mind, and to bring even the thoughts into subjection to Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>July 26, 1897. I render thanks unto my heavenly Father for His blessing, after seeking the Lord in prayer. I go
          to my heavenly Father as a child in need goes to his temporal earthly father. We know that God must be
          interested in us, as the earthly parent is interested in his child, but to a much larger degree. I place
          myself as His child, and in simple faith ask for the small favors as I would ask for larger gifts, believing
          the Lord hears the simple, contrite prayer.</p>
      <p>I keep saying in my heart, He loves me, He wants my love, and He wants me to be happy. “No good thing will he
          withhold from them that walk uprightly.” “For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and
          glory.” “O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee” (Psalm 84:11, 12).</p>
      <p>I will appropriate His promises to myself, and will be glad in the Lord and ever praise His holy name.<span
