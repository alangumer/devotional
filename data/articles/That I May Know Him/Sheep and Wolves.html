      <p><strong>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
          pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. Matthew 5:44.</strong></p>
      <p>In these last days, when iniquity shall abound and the love of many shall wax cold, God will have a people to
          glorify His name, and stand as reprovers of unrighteousness. They are to be a “peculiar people,” who will be
          true to the law of God when the world shall seek to make void its precepts, and when the converting power of
          God works through His servants, the hosts of darkness will array themselves in bitter and determined
          opposition....</p>
      <p>Satan is at enmity with the truth, and he will instigate against its advocates every manner of warfare.<span

      <p>We must have our lives so hid with Christ in God that when bitter speeches and scornful words and unkind looks
          meet us, we shall not permit our feelings to be stirred up against this class, but shall feel the deepest
          sympathy for them, because they know nothing about the precious Saviour whom we claim to know. We must
          remember that they are in the service of one who is the bitterest enemy of Jesus Christ, and that while all
          heaven is opened to the sons and daughters of God, they have no such privilege. You ought to feel that you are
          the happiest people upon the face of the whole earth. Notwithstanding, as Christ’s representatives, you are as
          sheep in the midst of wolves, you have One with you who can help you under all circumstances, and you will not
          be devoured by these wolves if you keep close to Jesus. How careful you should be to represent Jesus in every
          word and action! You should feel when you arise in the morning, and when you go out upon the street, and when
          you come in, that Jesus loves you, that He is by your side, and that you must not cherish a thought that will
          grieve your Saviour....</p>
      <p>The evil angels may be all around you to press their darkness upon you, but the will of God is greater than
          their power. And if you do not in word or action, or in any way, make Christ ashamed of you, the sweet
          blessing and peace of God will be in your heart every day you live.<span class="ft11">36</span></p>
