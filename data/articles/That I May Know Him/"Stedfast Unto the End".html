    <h1>“Stedfast Unto the End”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our conﬁdence stedfast unto the end.
          Hebrews 3:14.</strong></p>
      <p>We must all exercise faith. I am praying to the Lord to give me strength and health and clearness of mind, and
          I believe He hears my prayers. We are exhorted to be sober and watch unto prayer, but this does not mean that
          we are to mourn and repine, like orphaned children. True, the struggle for continual advancement in the
          Christian life must be lifelong, but our advancement in the heavenly path may be hopeful. If we manifest an
          intense energy, proportionate to the object for which we are striving, even eternal life, we are made
          partakers of Christ and of all the rich graces He is willing and ready to give to those who by patient
          continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality. If we hold the beginning of our conﬁdence
          steadfast unto the end we shall see the King in His glory.</p>
      <p>I do not ask for smooth paths, but I do supplicate my heavenly Father for an increase of faith, that I may
          surmount every apparent difﬁculty. He is able and willing to give us the Comforter, but we must have ﬁrmness
          and decision, maintaining under all circumstances a pure, Christian integrity and conﬁdence in our Lord and
          Saviour Jesus Christ. The exhortation comes to us, “Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before,
          beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness” (2 Peter
          3:17).</p>
      <p>Eternal interests are to be gained, even the salvation of our souls, and every day we are to watch and be
          sober. Yet we are to be cheerful, thanking the Lord for His blessings. We must have faith, living faith. God
          is our efﬁciency, the source of all power. His resources cannot be exhausted. We can have a daily, abundant
          supply....</p>
      <p>For every one whose hands seem to be weakening and losing their hold, I have the word, Grasp the standard more
          ﬁrmly. Faith says, Go forward. You must not fail nor be discouraged. There is no weakness of faith in him who
          is constantly advancing.<span class="ft11">19</span></p>
