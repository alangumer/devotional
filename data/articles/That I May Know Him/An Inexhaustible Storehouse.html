    <h1>An Inexhaustible Storehouse</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; in whom are hid all the
          treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Colossians 2:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>Said Christ, “All things that the Father hath are mine.” “I and my Father are one” (John 16:15; 10:30). “I
          appoint unto you a kingdom” (Luke 22:29). The Lord Jesus lays His hand upon the eternal throne of God with all
          the ease and assurance of one who rules and reigns, putting on His head the crown of deity. He sits at the
          right hand of God and receives supreme honor as God, the glory He had before the world was. He distributes His
          gifts to all who by faith shall claim them....</p>
      <p>We have an inexhaustible storehouse, an ocean of love in the God of our salvation. He has placed in the hands
          of Christ all the treasures of the heavenly resources and says, “All these are for man, in order to convince
          fallen, sinful man of My love, ... and that for his happiness I am working and will work.” The happiness of
          man is to know God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent. It was to make this vast treasure house of all good
          available that the Word became ﬂesh and dwelt among us. He sprinkled every gift with His own blood.... The
          gift to</p>
      <p>our world in sending Jesus is an exhibition of His grace which God Himself cannot surpass.... But one thing
          is</p>
      <p>impossible with <nobr>God—the</nobr> power of eclipsing the greatness of His gift in showing His love for
          fallen man....</p>
      <p>Had God the Father come to our world and dwelt among us, humbling Himself, veiling His glory, that humanity
          might look upon Him, the history that we have of the life of Christ would not have been changed....</p>
      <p>In every act of Jesus, in every lesson of His instruction, we are to see and hear and recognize God. In sight,
          in hearing, in effect, it is the voice and movements of the Father.</p>
      <p>But language seems to be so feeble! I refrain, and with John exclaim, “Behold, what manner of love the Father
          hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God” (1 John 3:1).<span
