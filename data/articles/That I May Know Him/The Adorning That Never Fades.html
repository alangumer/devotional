    <h1>The Adorning That Never Fades</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of
          putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the
          ornament of a meek and quite spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 1 Peter 3:3,
          4.</strong></p>
      <p>The charms that consist only in the outward apparel are shallow and changeable; no dependence can be placed
          upon them. The adorning which Christ enjoins upon His followers will never fade....</p>
      <p>If half the time spent by the youth in making themselves attractive in outward appearance were given to soul
          culture, to the inward adorning, what a difference would be seen in their deportment, words, and actions!
          Those who are truly seeking to follow Christ will have conscientious scruples in regard to the dress they
          wear; they will strive to meet the requirements ... so plainly given by the Lord.<span

      <p>Many dress like the world to have an inﬂuence. They spend hours that are worse than thrown away, in studying
          this or that fashion to decorate the poor, mortal body. But here they make a sad and fatal mistake. If they
          would have a saving inﬂuence, if they would have their lives tell in favor of the truth, let them imitate the
          humble Pattern. Let them show their faith by righteous works, and make the distinction broad between
          themselves and the world. The words, the dress, and the actions should tell for God. Then a holy inﬂuence will
          be shed upon all, and all will take knowledge of them, that they have been with Jesus. Unbelievers will see
          that faith in Christ’s coming affects the character....</p>
      <p>The external appearance is an index to the heart. When hearts are affected by the truth there will be a death
          to the world, and those who are dead to the world will not be moved by the laugh, the jeer, and the scorn of
          unbelievers. They will feel an anxious desire to be like their Master, separate from the world. They will not
          imitate its fashions or customs. The noble object will be ever before them, to glorify God and gain the
          immortal inheritance, and in comparison with this everything of an earthly nature will sink into
          insigniﬁcance.<span class="ft17">3</span></p>
