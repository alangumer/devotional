    <h1>Living Out God’s Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Matthew
          11:27.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus came to represent the character of God in living out the holy law of Jehovah. In every lesson He gave to
          His disciples and to the people He sought to deﬁne clearly its principles. By personal obedience to the law He
          invested the common duties of life with a holy signiﬁcance. He lived a man among men.... He lived among</p>
      <p>the people, He shared their poverty and their griefs. He digniﬁed life in all its details by keeping before men
          the glory of God, and by subordinating everything to the will of His Father. His life was characterized by
          supreme love to God, and fervent love to His fellow men....</p>
      <p>His life from its beginning to its close, was one of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr>
          Upon the cross of Calvary He made the great sacriﬁce of Himself in behalf of all men, that the whole world
          might have salvation if they would. Christ was hid in God, and God stood revealed to the world in the
          character of His Son....</p>
      <p>Love for a lost world was manifested every day, in every act of His life. Those who are imbued by His Spirit
          will work in the same lines as those in which Christ worked. In Christ the light and love of God were
          manifested in human nature. No human being has ever possessed so sensitive a nature as did the sinless, holy
          One of God, who stood as head and representative of what humanity may become through the imparting of the
          divine nature. To those who believe in Christ as their personal Saviour, He imputes His merit and imparts His
          power. To those who come to Him with their burden of grief, disappointments, and trials, He will give rest and
          peace. It is through the grace of Christ that the soul sees his need of repentance toward God..., and is led
          to look to Christ by faith, realizing that His merit is efﬁcacious to save to the uttermost all who come unto
          God by Him.... Let us</p>
      <p>open our hearts to receive the love which it is so essential that we should cultivate in order that we may
          fulﬁll the commandments of God.<span class="ft15">11</span></p>
