    <h1>Co-Workers in Creation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. ... So God created man in his own
          image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Genesis 1:26, 27.</strong></p>
      <p>After the earth was created, and the beasts upon it, the Father and Son carried out their purpose, which was
          designed before the fall of Satan, to make man in their own image. They had wrought together in the creation
          of the earth and every living thing upon it. And now God said to His Son, “Let us make man in our image.”<span

      <p>Adam and Eve came forth from the hand of their Creator in the perfection of every physical, mental, and
          spiritual endowment. God planted for them a garden and surrounded them with everything lovely and attractive
          to the eye, and that which their physical necessities required....</p>
      <p>The holy pair looked upon nature as a picture of unsurpassed loveliness. The brown earth was clothed with a
          carpet of living green, diversiﬁed with an endless variety of
          <nobr>self-propagating,</nobr><nobr>self-perpetuating</nobr> ﬂowers. Shrubs, ﬂowers, and trailing vines
          regaled the senses with their beauty and fragrance. The many varieties of lofty trees were laden with fruit of
          every kind and of delicious ﬂavor. ...</p>
      <p>Adam and Eve could trace the skill and glory of God in every spire of grass and in every shrub and ﬂower. The
          natural loveliness which surrounded them, like a mirror reﬂected the wisdom, excellence, and love of their
          heavenly Father. And their songs of affection and praise rose sweetly and reverentially to heaven, harmonizing
          with the songs of the exalted angels, and with the happy birds who were caroling forth their music without a
          care. There was no disease, decay, nor death anywhere. Life, life was in everything the eye rested upon. The
          atmosphere was impregnated with life....</p>
      <p>Adam could reﬂect that he was created in the image of God, to be like Him in righteousness and holiness. His
          mind was capable of continual cultivation, expansion, reﬁnement and noble elevation, for God was his teacher,
          and angels were his companions.<span class="ft11">14</span></p>
