    <h1>Imitating Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of
          our profession, Christ Jesus; who was faithful to him that appointed him. Hebrews 3:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>In giving to men an example of what they should be and do, Jesus, the world’s Redeemer, did not have a smooth
          path to travel.... Jesus had been the commander of heaven, yet on earth He was as one that serveth.</p>
      <p>Uncomplainingly He endured privations, and lived the life of a poor man. He did not indulge in the luxuries
          that many who claim to be His followers surround themselves with; He studied not at all His pleasure, ease, or
          convenience. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. His whole life was one of
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> expressing the prayer, “Not my will, but thine, O God, be done.”</p>
      <p>Christ is our pattern, and those who follow Christ will not walk in darkness, for they will not seek their own
          pleasure. To glorify God will be the continual aim of their life. Christ represented the character of God to
          the world. The Lord Jesus so conducted His life that men were compelled to acknowledge that He had done all
          things well. The world’s Redeemer was the light of the world, for His character was without fault. Though He
          was the only begotten Son of God, and the heir of all things in heaven and earth, He did not leave an example
          of indolence and <nobr>self-indulgence....</nobr></p>
      <p>Christ never ﬂattered any one. He never deceived or defrauded, never changed His course of straightforward
          uprightness to obtain favor or applause. He ever expressed the truth. The law of kindness was in His lips, and
          there was no guile in His mouth. Let the human agent compare his life with the life of Christ, and through the
          grace which Jesus imparts to those who make Him their personal Saviour, reach the standard of righteousness.
          Let him imitate the example of Him who lived out the law of Jehovah, who said, “I have kept my Father’s
          commandments” (John 15:10). Those who follow Christ will be continually looking into the perfect law of
          liberty, and through the grace given them by Christ, will fashion the character according to the divine
          requirements.<span class="ft11">37</span></p>
