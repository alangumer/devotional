    <h1>The Measure of Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed
          up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth
          not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
          endureth all things. 1 Corinthians <nobr>13:4-7.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Through His inspired apostle Christ has presented to us the measure of the character that is imbued with the
          love of Christ. We are to bear the marks of Christ, we are to have His likeness. This example is given us that
          we may know the possibilities, the heights we may reach in and through Christ. The standard He presents is
          perfection in Him, and through His merits we may attain to it. We come short because we are content to look at
          earthly things rather than at heavenly. It is by beholding Christ that we are changed from glory to glory. The
          eye that views common things needs to be elevated....</p>
      <p>No man has yet measured the nature of God or the character of His Son. We must have a knowledge of God by
          living experience.<span class="ft15">30</span></p>
      <p>This life is our time of probation. We are placed under the discipline and government of God to form characters
          and acquire habits for the higher life.... We shall be subject to heavy trials, opposition, bereavement,</p>
      <p>afﬂiction, but we know that Jesus passed through all these. These experiences are valuable to us; the
          advantages are not by any means conﬁned to this short life; they reach into eternal ages.... All the scenes of
          this life in which</p>
      <p>we must act a part are to be carefully studied, for they are a part of our education. We should bring solid
          timbers into our character building, for we are working both for this life and eternal life. And as we near
          the close of this earth’s history we advance more and more rapidly in Christian growth, or we retrograde just
          as decidedly....</p>
      <p>Mercy and truth have met together in Christ, and righteousness and peace have embraced each other. It is when
          you are looking to His throne, offering up your penitence and praise and thanksgiving to God, that you perfect
          Christian character, and represent Christ to the world. You abide in Christ and Christ abides in you.<span
