    <h1>Subjects of the King!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us. Isaiah
          33:22. This morning [Early morning diary entry, Sept. 5, 1900.] my soul is ﬁlled with praise and thanksgiving
          to God from whom come all our mercies and blessings. The Lord is good, and His mercies endure forever. I will
          praise Him who is the light of my countenance and my God. He is the source of all efﬁciency and power. Why do
          we not praise Him by speaking words of hope and comfort to others? Why are our lips so silent? Speech is a
          gift of Heaven, and it should be used in sounding forth the praises of Him who hath called us out of
          darkness</strong></p>
      <p>into His marvelous light....</p>
      <p>O how much good would be accomplished were God honored by all who profess to be Christians! ... The Light of
          the world is shining upon men in richest blessing. Every provision has been made for the supplying of our
          temporal and spiritual needs. Yet how little thanksgiving the Giver receives! ...</p>
      <p>In receiving Christ as our Captain there must be a complete surrender of the human will to the divine will. The
          Lord can work out His will through those who have made this surrender, for they give prompt and cheerful
          obedience to His commands. God expects us to obey without questioning. We are to ask, “Lord, what wilt thou
          have me to do?” Then, though the command may be as stern and startling as that given to Abraham, we are to
          obey. Abraham’s soul was rent asunder by the command, “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
          lovest, and offer him for a sacriﬁce on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of” (Genesis 22:2). But he
          did not hesitate to obey.</p>
      <p>All our activities, all our business arrangements, should be in perfect accord with the Lord’s commands. The
          laws of God’s kingdom must be obeyed by the subjects of that kingdom. Our zeal for the advancement of God’s
          kingdom is to mark us as faithful subjects of the cross of Christ. God can trust as His representatives those
          who implicitly obey Him.<span class="ft11">1</span></p>
