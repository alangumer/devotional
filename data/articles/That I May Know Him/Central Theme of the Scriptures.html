    <h1>Central Theme of the Scriptures</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things
          concerning himself. Luke 24:27.</strong></p>
      <p>There is one great central truth to be kept ever before the mind in the searching of the
          <nobr>Scriptures—Christ</nobr> and Him cruciﬁed. Every other truth is invested with inﬂuence and power
          corresponding to its relation to this theme. It is only in the light of the cross that we can discern the
          exalted character of the law of God. The soul palsied by sin can be endowed with life only through the work
          wrought out upon the cross by the Author of our salvation. The love of Christ constrains man to unite with Him
          in His labors and sacriﬁce. The revelation of divine love awakens in them a sense of their neglected
          obligation to be light bearers to the world, and inspires them with a missionary spirit. This truth enlightens
          the mind and sanctiﬁes the soul. It will banish unbelief and inspire faith.... When Christ in His work of
          redemption is seen to be the great central truth of the system of truth,</p>
      <p>a new light is shed upon all the events of the past and the future. They are seen in a new relation, and
          possess a new and deeper signiﬁcance.<span class="ft15">34</span></p>
      <p>The Old Testament is as verily the gospel in types and shadows as the New Testament is in its unfolding power.
          The New Testament does not present a new religion; the Old Testament does not present a religion to be
          superseded by the New. The New Testament is only the advancement and unfolding of the Old. Abel was a believer
          in Christ and was as verily saved by His power as was Peter or Paul. Enoch was a representative of Christ as
          surely as was the beloved disciple John.... That God who walked with Enoch was our Lord and Saviour,</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ. He was the light of the world then, just as He is now.<span class="ft15">35</span></p>
      <p>The truth for this time is broad in its outlines, far reaching, embracing many doctrines, but these doctrines
          are not detached items which mean little; they are united by golden threads, forming a complete whole, with
          Christ as the living center.<span class="ft11">36</span></p>
