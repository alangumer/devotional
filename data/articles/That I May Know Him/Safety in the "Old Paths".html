    <h1>Safety in the “Old Paths”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way,
          and walk therein, and ye shall ﬁnd rest for your souls. Jeremiah 6:16.</strong></p>
      <p>There is no safety anywhere. Satan has come down with great power and is working with all deceivableness of
          unrighteousness in them that perish. Those who do not follow in Christ’s footsteps will ﬁnd themselves
          following another leader. They have listened to strange voices until they cannot distinguish the voice of the
          True Shepherd. Little by little they ceased to heed the warnings, the reproofs, the instructions. Human wisdom
          came in, human imaginations were followed. Much reliance is placed upon human exertion and devices, and they
          imperceptibly go on until they are fully satisﬁed with their own wisdom, their own inventions, and are ﬁlled
          with their own doings.</p>
      <p>Drink deep at the fountain of truth, and be a close student of the Word, for the Lord will take the words of
          truth and through the Holy Spirit imprint them on your heart that you may present the precious Word with
          simplicity and fervor. “Rejoice in the Lord alway: ...” that Jesus is glad to receive you with all your
          imperfections, with all your weakness, and acknowledge you as His child. Therefore, trust Him. Adorn the
          doctrine of Christ our Saviour by a <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life and a godly conversation. “Let your
          moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for <nobr>nothing”—that</nobr> is, be not
          <nobr>overanxious—“but</nobr> in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be
          made known unto God.” What a privilege is this given to every one to trust in Jesus and tell Him everything!
          “And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus”
          (Philippians <nobr>4:4-7).</nobr></p>
      <p>Have faith in God. However stormy may be the times, looking unto Jesus who is the author and the ﬁnisher of
          your faith, you will be complete in Him. Abide in the old paths, whoever may turn back. Be rooted and grounded
          and built up in the most holy faith, a living epistle known and read of all men.<span
