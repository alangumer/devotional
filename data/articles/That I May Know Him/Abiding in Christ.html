    <h1>Abiding in Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no
          more can ye, except ye abide in me. John 15:4.</strong></p>
      <p>“Abide in me” are words of great signiﬁcance. Abiding in Christ means a living, earnest, refreshing faith that
          works by love and puriﬁes the soul. It means a constant receiving of the spirit of Christ, a life of
          unreserved surrender to His service. Where this union exists, good works will appear. The life of the vine
          will manifest itself in fragrant fruit on the branches. The continual supply of the grace of Christ will bless
          you and make you a blessing, till you can say with Paul, “I am cruciﬁed with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet
          not I, but Christ liveth in me” (Galatians 2:20).</p>
      <p>The sacred union with Christ will unite the brethren in the most endearing bonds of Christian fellowship. Their
          hearts will be touched with divine compassion one for another.... Coldness, variance, strife, are
          entirely</p>
      <p>out of place among the disciples of Christ. They have accepted the one faith. They have joined to serve the one
          Lord, to endure in the same warfare, to strive for the same object, and to triumph in the same cause. They
          have been bought with the same precious blood, and have gone forth to preach the same message of
          salvation....</p>
      <p>Those who are constantly drawing strength from Christ will possess His spirit. They will not be careless in
          word or deportment. An abiding sense of how much their salvation has cost in the sacriﬁce of the beloved Son
          of God will rest upon their souls. Like a fresh and vivid transaction the scenes of Calvary will present
          themselves to their minds and their hearts will be subdued and made tender by this wonderful manifestation of
          the love of Christ to them. They will look upon others as the purchase of His precious blood, and those who
          are united with Him will seem noble and elevated and sacred because of this connection. The death of Christ on
          Calvary should lead us to estimate souls as He did. His love has magniﬁed the value of every man, woman, and
          child.<span class="ft22">7</span></p>
