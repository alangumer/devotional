    <h1>Mercy for the Repentant</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9.</strong></p>
      <p>All are fallible, all make mistakes and fall into sin; but if the wrongdoer is willing to see his errors, as
          they are made plain by the convicting Spirit of God, and in humility of heart will confess them... , then he
          may be restored....</p>
      <p>The mansions that Jesus has gone to prepare for all who love Him will be peopled by those who are free from
          sin. But sins that are not confessed will never be forgiven; the name of him who thus rejects the grace of God
          will be blotted out of the book of life. The time is at hand when every secret thing shall be brought into
          judgment, and then there will be many confessions made that will astonish the world. The secrets of all hearts
          will be revealed. The confession of sin will be most public. The sad part of it is that confession then made
          will be too late to beneﬁt the wrongdoer or to save others from deception. It only testiﬁes that his
          condemnation is just.... You may now close the book of your remembrance in order to escape confessing your
          sins, but when the</p>
      <p>judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, you cannot close them. The recording angel has testiﬁed that
          which is true. All that you have tried to conceal and forget is registered, and will be read to you when it is
          too late for wrongs to be righted.... Unless your sins are canceled, they will testify against you at that
          day.<span class="ft17">29</span></p>
      <p>The prophet Daniel was drawing very near to God when he was seeking Him with confession and humiliation of
          soul. He did not try to excuse himself or his people, but acknowledged the full extent of their transgression.
          In their behalf he confessed sins of which he himself was not guilty, and besought the mercy of God, that he
          might bring his brethren to see their sins....</p>
      <p>To all who seek Him with true repentance God gives the assurance: “I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy
          transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee” (Isaiah 44:22).<span
