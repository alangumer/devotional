      <p><strong>Can two walk together, except they be agreed? Amos 3:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Enoch walked with God. He was of one mind with God. The prophet asks, “Can two walk together, except they be
          agreed?” If we are of one mind with God, our will will be swallowed up in God’s will and we shall follow
          wherever God leads the way. As a loving child places his hand in that of his father, and walks with him in
          perfect trust whether it is dark or bright, so the sons and daughters of God are to walk with Jesus through
          joy or sorrow....</p>
      <p>The followers of Christ are to manifest to the world the characteristics of their Lord. They must not become
          careless or inattentive to their duty, or indifferent as to their inﬂuence, for they are to be representatives
          of Jesus in the earth....</p>
      <p>Those who do not walk in all faith and purity ﬁnd the thought of coming into the presence of God a thought of
          terror. They do not love to think or speak of God. They say in heart and by their actions, “Depart from us, O
          God; we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.” But through faith in Christ the true Christian knows the mind
          and will of God. He understands by a living experience something of the length and depth and breadth and
          height of the love of God that passeth knowledge.</p>
      <p>The soul that loves God loves to draw strength from Him by constant communion with Him. When it becomes the
          habit of the soul to converse with God, the power of the evil one is broken, for Satan cannot abide near the
          soul that draws nigh unto God. If Christ is your companion, you will not cherish vain and impure thoughts; you
          will not indulge in triﬂing words that will grieve Him who has come to be the sanctiﬁer of your soul....</p>
      <p>Those who are sanctiﬁed through the truth are living recommendations of its power, and representatives of their
          risen Lord. The religion of Christ will reﬁne the taste, sanctify the judgment, elevate, purify, and ennoble
          the soul, making the Christian more and more ﬁt for the society of the heavenly angels.<span
