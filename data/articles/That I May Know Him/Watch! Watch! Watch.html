    <h1>Watch! Watch! Watch!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at
          the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he ﬁnd you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say
          unto all, Watch. Mark <nobr>13:35-37.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>It is a time now when we cannot for a moment take the spiritual eye from Christ Jesus. His admonition to us is,
          “What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.” Is there one professed Christian who needs not the warning, and
          whose heart will not bear watching? The heart must be kept with all diligence, under constant
          watchfulness....</p>
      <p>Watch the stealthy approach of the enemy, watch against old habits and natural inclinations lest they exert
          themselves; force them back, and watch; force them back if need be a hundred times. Watch the thoughts, watch
          the plans, lest they become selﬁsh and <nobr>self-centered.</nobr> Watch and pray, lest ye enter into
          temptation. Watch over the souls whom Christ has purchased with His own blood. Watch for opportunities to do
          them good.</p>
      <p>Like Mary, we need to sit at the feet of Jesus to learn of Him, having chosen that better part which will never
          be taken from us. Like Martha we need to be ever abounding in the work of the Lord. The higher Christian
          attainments can be reached only by being much on our knees in sincere prayer.... One ﬁber of the root of</p>
      <p>selﬁshness remaining in the soul will spring up when least expected, and thereby will many be deﬁled.<span

      <p>We are in an enemy’s country. He who was cast out of heaven has come down with great power. With every
          conceivable artiﬁce and device he is seeking to take souls captive. Unless we are constantly on guard we shall
          fall an easy prey to his unnumbered deceptions.</p>
      <p>We are stewards, entrusted by our absent Lord with the care of His household and His interests, which He came
          to this world to serve. He has returned to heaven, leaving us in charge, and He expects us to watch and wait
          and prepare for His coming. Let us be faithful to our trust, lest coming suddenly He ﬁnd us sleeping.<span
