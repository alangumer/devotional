    <h1>Teaching in Depth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The ofﬁcers answered, Never man spake like this man. John 7:46.</strong></p>
      <p>Of Christ’s teaching it is said, “The common people heard him gladly” (Mark 12:37). “Never man spake like this
          man,” declared the ofﬁcers who were sent to take Him. His words comforted, strengthened, and blessed those who
          were hungering for that peace which He alone could give. O how tender and forbearing was Christ! how ﬁlled
          with pity and tenderness were His lessons to the poor, the afﬂicted, and the oppressed! ... His illustrations
          were taken from the things of daily life, and ... had in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The fowls of the
          air, the lilies of the ﬁeld, the seed, the shepherd and the <nobr>sheep—with</nobr> these objects Christ
          illustrated immortal truth, and ever afterward, when His hearers chanced to see these things of nature, they
          recalled His words....</p>
      <p>Christ’s words, so comforting and cheering to those that listened to them, are for us today. As a faithful
          shepherd knows and cares for his sheep, so Christ cares for His children. He knows the trials and difﬁculties
          surrounding each one. “He shall feed his ﬂock like a shepherd,” declares Isaiah: “he shall gather the lambs
          with his arms, and carry them in his bosom.” Christ knows His sheep intimately, and the suffering and helpless
          are objects of His special care....</p>
      <p>Christ has weighed every human afﬂiction, every human sorrow. He bears the weight of the yoke for every soul
          that yokes up with Him. He knows the sorrows which we feel to the depth of our being, and which we cannot
          express. If no human heart is aroused to sympathy for us, we need not feel that we are without sympathy.
          Christ knows; and He says, Look unto Me, and live. “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
          I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). I have borne your griefs and carried your sorrows. You have the
          deepest, richest sympathy in the tender, pitying love of your Shepherd.... His humanity is not lost in the
          exalted character</p>
      <p>of His Omnipotence. He is ever longing to pour out His sympathy and love upon those whom He has chosen, and who
          will respond to His invitation.<span class="ft15">18</span></p>
