    <h1>Isaac a Figure of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up
          his only begotten son, of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Hebrews 11:17,
          18.</strong></p>
      <p>The offering of Isaac was designed by God to preﬁgure the sacriﬁce of His Son. Isaac was a ﬁgure of the Son of
          God, who was offered a sacriﬁce for the sins of the world. God desired to impress upon Abraham the gospel of
          salvation of men.... He was made to understand in his own experience how great was the
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> of</p>
      <p>the inﬁnite God in giving His Son to rescue man from ruin.</p>
      <p>To Abraham no mental torture could be equal to that which he endured in obeying the command to sacriﬁce his
          son. ... With a breaking heart and unnerved hand, he takes the ﬁre, while Isaac inquires, “Behold the ﬁre and
          the wood: but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” (Genesis 22:7). But oh, Abraham cannot tell him now!
          Father and son build the altar, and the terrible moment comes for Abraham to make known to Isaac that which
          has agonized his soul during all that long <nobr>journey—that</nobr> Isaac himself is the victim.... The son
          submits to the</p>
      <p>sacriﬁce because he believes in the integrity of his father. But when everything is ready, when the faith of
          the father and the submission of the son are fully tested, the angel of God stays the uplifted hand of
          Abraham, and tells him that it is enough. “Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy
          son, thine only son from me” (verse 12).<span class="ft11">30</span></p>
      <p>Our heavenly Father surrendered His beloved Son to the agonies of the cruciﬁxion. Legions of angels witnessed
          the humiliation and soul anguish of the Son of God, but were not permitted to interpose as in the case of
          Isaac. No voice was heard to stay the sacriﬁce. God’s dear Son, the world’s Redeemer, was insulted, mocked at,
          derided, and tortured, until He bowed His head in death. What greater proof can the Inﬁnite One give us of His
          divine love and pity? “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with
          him also freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32).<span class="ft11">31</span></p>
