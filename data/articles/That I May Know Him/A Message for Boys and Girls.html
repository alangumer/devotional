    <h1>A Message for Boys and Girls</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Psalm 34:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Every child and every youth should bear in mind, “I am of value in the sight of God; I am bought with a price,
          and I am the property of Jesus Christ. As a follower of Christ I am to practice His virtues, that I may
          represent my Saviour.”</p>
      <p>Pray much. While at your work let your heart be uplifted to God. When you have committed to God the keeping of
          your soul, do not go away and act directly contrary to the prayer you have made. Watch as well as pray, lest
          you be overcome with temptation. Resist the ﬁrst inclination to do wrong. Pray in your heart, “Jesus, help me;
          preserve me from evil,” and then do what you know Christ would be pleased to have you do....</p>
      <p>You may ask, as many others have done, How may I know that Jesus receives me and loves me? Shall I know by my
          feelings? No; by obedience to His Holy Word. Appropriate to yourself the rich promises of God. Believe His
          word that Jesus is abiding in your heart by faith. Through faith and trust in God you may have His peace, and
          you can then say, “I know in whom I have believed. I will listen to every whisper of His Holy Spirit.”</p>
      <p>There is but one way to be victorious. Serve God with all your heart because you love Him. Seek Him daily
          because you love Him and know what He is to you. Be faithful in the little things, although no eye but the
          Lord’s may review your work. Remember that you are doing service for Christ. You may now be obtaining a
          precious experience every day in serving God. Plant the principles of truth in your own soul, and reveal
          Christ in your character. Do not be satisﬁed with a common, low level. You can ... resemble Christ in
          character....</p>
      <p>Look unto Jesus constantly if you would advance step by step in the narrow path cast up for the chosen of the
          Lord to walk in, saying in your heart, “Thee will I seek, O God; Thee will I follow; Thee will I serve; under
          Thy guidance I can and will go forward.”<span class="ft15">6</span></p>
