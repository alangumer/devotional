    <h1>The Game of Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 1 Corinthians 16:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The truth of God obeyed, the living by every word of God, is alone sufﬁcient to make any of us stand in these
          evil times. Satan is playing the game of life for the soul....</p>
      <p>There are opportunities and advantages which are within the reach of all to strengthen the moral and spiritual
          powers. The mind can be expanded and ennobled and should be made to dwell upon heavenly things.... Unless
          it</p>
      <p>ﬂows in a heavenward direction it becomes an easy prey to the temptation of Satan to engage in worldly projects
          and enterprises that have no special connection with God. And all zeal and devotion and restless energy and
          feverish desire are brought into this work, and the devil stands by and laughs to see human effort wrestling
          so perseveringly for an object that it will never gain, which eludes its grasp.... Schemes and projects which
          Satan</p>
      <p>invents ensnare the soul, and poor, deceived human beings go on blindfolded to their own ruin....</p>
      <p>There is one safeguard against Satan’s deceptions and snares, that is the truth as it is in Jesus. The truth
          planted in the heart, nourished by watchfulness and prayer, nourished by the grace of Christ, will give us
          discernment. The truth must abide in the heart, be felt in its power in spite of all the alluring enchantments
          of Satan, and your experience and mine must be that the truth can purify, guide, and bless the soul....</p>
      <p>The enemy is on the track of every one of us, and if we would resist temptations which assail us from without
          and from within, we need to make sure we are on the Lord’s side, that His truth is in our hearts, that it
          keeps watch in our souls, ready to sound an alarm and summon us to action against every enemy. Without this
          defense amid unseen foes we shall be like the willow bending to the blast, driven of the wind and tossed. But
          if Christ abides in the soul we may be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.<span
