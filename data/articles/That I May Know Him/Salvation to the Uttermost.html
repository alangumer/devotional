    <h1>Salvation to the Uttermost</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
          liveth to make intercession for them. Hebrews 7:25.</strong></p>
      <p>What does intercession comprehend? It is the golden chain which binds ﬁnite man to the throne of the inﬁnite
          God. The human agent whom Christ has died to save importunes the throne of God, and his petition is taken up
          by Jesus who has purchased him with His own blood. Our great High Priest places His righteousness on the side
          of the sincere suppliant, and the prayer of Christ blends with that of the human petitioner.</p>
      <p>Christ has urged that His people pray without ceasing. This does not mean that we should always be upon our
          knees, but that prayer is to be as the breath of the soul. Our silent requests, wherever we may be, are to be
          ascending unto God, and Jesus our Advocate pleads in our behalf, bearing up with the incense of His
          righteousness our requests to the Father.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus loves His people, and when they put their trust in Him, depending wholly upon Him, He
          strengthens them. He will live through them, giving them the inspiration of His sanctifying Spirit, imparting
          to the soul a vital transfusion of Himself. He acts through their faculties and causes them to choose His will
          and to act out His character. With the apostle Paul they then may say, “I am cruciﬁed with Christ:
          nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the ﬂesh I live by
          the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me” (Galatians 2:20)....</p>
      <p>The Lord will not leave His afﬂicted, tried children to be the sport of Satan’s temptations. It is your
          privilege to trust in Jesus. The heavens are full of rich blessings.... We have not because we ask not, or
          because we do not</p>
      <p>pray in faith, believing that we shall be blessed with the special inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit. To the true
          seeker through the mediation of Christ the gracious inﬂuences of the Holy Spirit are imparted.<span
