    <h1>Where Are You Pitching Your Tent?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right
          hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. Colossians 3:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>Many who should be setting their tents nearer to the land of Canaan are pitching their camp nearer to Egypt.
          They are not living in the light of the Sun of Righteousness. Many attend places of amusement to gratify the
          taste, but no spiritual strength is gained by so doing, and you will ﬁnd yourself on the losing side. To
          encourage the love of amusement is to discourage the love of religious exercises, for the heart becomes so
          crowded with triﬂing, with what is pleasing to the natural heart, that there is no room for Jesus....</p>
      <p>It requires the faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul to meet the mind of God. There are those who
          believe in Christ; they do not think Him an impostor; they believe the Bible to be a revelation of His divine
          character. They admire its holy doctrines, and revere the name, the only name given under heaven whereby men
          can be saved, and yet, with all this knowledge, they may be as truly ignorant of the grace of God as the
          veriest sinner. They have not opened the heart to let Jesus in.<span class="ft11">37</span></p>
      <p>What shall I say for the beneﬁt of the youth? Will you open your hearts to Jesus, that His love, His mercy, may
          ﬁll the chambers of your soul, that you may sing and make melody in your hearts unto God? O if all your
          affections were given unto Jesus, you would learn the language and the songs of Canaan!</p>
      <p>In the worldling you expect to see lightness, triﬂing, vanity, immorality, jesting, and joking, but let it not
          so much as be named among you who are risen with Christ.... We must now elevate our thoughts and come to
          learn</p>
      <p>in the school of the Master.<span class="ft15">38</span></p>
      <p>As we near the close of time, the current of evil will set more and more decidedly toward perdition. We can be
          safe only as we hold ﬁrmly to the hand of Jesus, constantly looking to the Author and Finisher of our faith.
          He is our mighty Helper.<span class="ft11">39</span></p>
