    <h1>Equality of Believers in Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.... There is neither Jew nor Greek,
          there</strong></p>
      <p>is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Galatians
          <nobr>3:26-28.</nobr></p>
      <p>The secret of unity is found in the equality of believers in Christ. The reason for all division, discord, and
          difference is found in separation from Christ. Christ is the center to which all should be attracted; for the
          nearer we approach the center, the closer we shall come together in feeling, in sympathy, in love, growing
          into the character and image of Jesus. With God there is no respect of persons.</p>
      <p>Jesus knew the worthlessness of earthly pomp, and He gave no attention to its display. In His dignity of soul,
          His elevation of character, His nobility of principle, He was far above the vain fashions of the world....
          He</p>
      <p>desired not the applause of men.... Wealth, position, worldly rank in all its varieties and distinctions of
          human</p>
      <p>greatness, were all but so many degrees of littleness to Him who had left the honor and glory of heaven, and
          who possessed no earthly splendor, indulged in no luxury, and displayed no adornment but humility.</p>
      <p>The lowly, those bound with poverty, pressed with care, burdened with toil, could ﬁnd no reason in His life and
          example which would lead them to think that Jesus was not acquainted with their trials, knew not the pressure
          of their circumstances, and could not sympathize with them in their want and sorrow. The lowliness of His
          humble, daily life was in harmony with His lowly birth and circumstances. The Son of the inﬁnite God, the Lord
          of life and glory, descended in humiliation to the life of the lowliest, that no one might feel himself
          excluded from His presence. He made Himself accessible to all. He did not select a favored few with whom to
          associate and ignore all others.<span class="ft11">4</span></p>
      <p>All men are of one family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came to demolish every wall
          of partition, ... that every soul may have free access to God. His love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it
          penetrates everywhere.<span class="ft11">5</span></p>
