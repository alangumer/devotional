    <h1>Reaching the Stature of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
          unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephesians 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The tremendous issues of eternity demand of us something more than an imaginary religion. A stately form of
          worship and high devotional ceremonies do not constitute a light to the world, and yet truth that is looked
          upon and admired in the same way as a beautiful picture or lovely ﬂower, and not brought into the inner
          sanctuary of the soul, is thought by many to be all that is required in a worshiper....</p>
      <p>We shall be saved eternally when we enter in through the gates into the city. Then we may rejoice that we are
          saved, eternally saved. But until then we need to heed the injunction of the apostle, and to “fear, lest, a
          promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should seem to come short of it” (Hebrews 4:1).
          Having a knowledge of Canaan, singing the songs of Canaan, rejoicing in the prospect of entering into Canaan,
          did not bring the children of Israel into the vineyards and olive groves of the Promised Land. They could make
          it theirs in truth only by occupation, by complying with the conditions, by exercising living faith in God, by
          appropriating His promises to themselves....</p>
      <p>Christ is the author and ﬁnisher of our faith, and when we yield to His hand we shall steadily grow in grace
          and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour. We shall make progress until we reach the full stature of men
          and women in Christ. Faith works by love, and puriﬁes the soul, expelling the love of sin that leads to
          rebellion against, and transgression of, the law of God.... Through the agency of the Holy Spirit the
          character</p>
      <p>is transformed and the mind and will of the human agent are brought into perfect conformity to the divine will,
          and this is conformity to the divine standard of righteousness. To those who are thus transformed Christ will
          say, “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter
          in through the gates into the city” (Revelation 22:14).<span class="ft11">6</span></p>
