    <h1>Holiness a Companion of Humility</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and
          be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 1 Peter
          5:5.</strong></p>
      <p>How many cling with tenacious grasp to their <nobr>self-termed</nobr> dignity, which is only
          <nobr>self-esteem.</nobr> These seek to honor themselves instead of waiting in humbleness of heart for Christ
          to honor them. In conversation more time is spent in talking of self than in exalting the riches of the grace
          of Christ....</p>
      <p>True holiness and humility are inseparable. The nearer the soul comes to God, the more completely is it humbled
          and subdued. When Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he exclaimed, “I abhor myself, and
          repent in dust and ashes” (Job 42:6). It was when Isaiah saw the glory of the Lord and heard the cherubim
          crying, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,” that he cried out, “Woe is me! for I am undone” (Isaiah 6:3,
          5). Daniel, when visited by the holy messenger, says, “My comeliness was turned in me into corruption” (Daniel
          10:8). Paul, after he was caught up into the third heaven and heard things that it was not lawful for a man to
          utter, speaks of himself as “less than the least of all saints” (Ephesians 3:8). It was the beloved John, who
          leaned on Jesus’ breast and beheld His glory, who fell as one dead before the angel. The more closely and
          continuously we behold our Saviour, the less shall we see to approve in ourselves.<span

      <p>He who catches a glimpse of the matchless love of Christ counts all other things as loss, and looks upon Him as
          the chiefest among ten thousand and as the one altogether lovely. As seraphim and cherubim look upon Christ,
          they cover their faces with their wings. Their own perfection and beauty are not displayed in the presence and
          glory of their Lord. Then how improper it is for men to exalt themselves! Let them rather be clothed with
          humility, cease all strife for supremacy, and learn what it means to be meek and lowly of heart. He who
          contemplates God’s glory and inﬁnite love, will have humble views of himself, but by beholding the character
          of God, he will be changed into His divine image.<span class="ft17">26</span></p>
