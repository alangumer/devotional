    <h1>Beware of Satan’s Snares</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,
          which drown men in destruction and perdition. 1 Timothy 6:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan has nets and snares, like the snares of the fowler, all prepared to entrap souls. It is his studied
          purpose that men shall employ their <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers for selﬁsh ends rather than yield them to
          glorify God. God would have men engage in a work that will bring them peace and joy and will render them
          eternal proﬁts, but Satan wants us to concentrate our efforts for that which proﬁteth not, for things that
          perish with the using....</p>
      <p>The heart of man may be the abode of the Holy Spirit. The peace of Christ that passeth understanding may rest
          in your soul, and the transforming power of His grace may work in your life and ﬁt you for the courts of
          glory. But if brain and nerve and muscle are all employed in the service of self, you are not making God and
          heaven the ﬁrst consideration of your life. It is impossible to be weaving the graces of Christ into your
          character while you are putting all your energies on the side of the world. You may be successful in heaping
          up treasure on the earth for the glory of self, but “where your treasure is, there will your heart be also”
          (Matthew 6:21). Eternal considerations will be made of secondary importance. You may take part in the outward
          forms of worship, but your service will be an abomination to the God of heaven....</p>
      <p>If the eye is single, if it is directed heavenward, the light of heaven will ﬁll the soul, and earthly things
          will appear insigniﬁcant and uninviting. The purpose of the heart will be changed, and the admonition of Jesus
          will be heeded. You will lay up your treasure in heaven. Your thoughts will be ﬁxed upon the great reward of
          eternity. All your plans will be made in reference to the future, immortal life. You will be drawn toward your
          treasure. You will not study your worldly interest, but in all your pursuits the silent inquiry will be,
          “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (Acts 9:6). Bible religion will be woven into your daily life.<span
