    <h1>Life Not to Be Triﬂed With</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Romans 14:12.</strong></p>
      <p>All of us, as beings blessed of God with reasoning powers, with intellect and judgment, should acknowledge our
          accountability to God. The life He has given us is a sacred responsibility, and no moment of it is to be
          triﬂed with, for we shall have to meet it again in the record of the judgment. In the books of heaven our
          lives are as accurately traced as in the picture on the plate of the photographer. Not only are we held
          accountable for what we have done, but for what we have left undone. We are held to account for our
          undeveloped characters, our unimproved opportunities....</p>
      <p>It is love of selﬁsh ease, love of pleasure, your <nobr>self-esteem,</nobr><nobr>self-exaltation,</nobr> that
          prevents you from learning the precious life lessons in the school of Christ. It is the Christian’s duty not
          to permit surroundings and circumstances to mold him, but to live above surroundings, fashioning his character
          according to the divine Model. He is to be faithful in whatever place he is found. He is to do his duty with
          ﬁdelity, improving the opportunities given him of God, making the most of his capabilities....</p>
      <p>If you are abiding in Christ, learning in His school, you will not be rude, dishonest, or unfaithful. The cross
          of Christ cuts to the root of all unholy passions and practices. Whatever the nature of your work, you will
          carry the principles of Christ into your labor and identify yourself with the task given into your hands. Your
          interest will be one with that of your employer. If you are paid for your time, you will realize that the time
          for work is not your own, but belongs to the one who pays you for it. If you are careless and extravagant,
          wasting material, squandering time, failing to be painstaking and diligent, you are registered in the books of
          heaven as an unfaithful servant.... Faithfulness, economy, caretaking, thoroughness, should characterize all
          our work.... “He</p>
      <p>that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much” (Luke 16:10).<span
