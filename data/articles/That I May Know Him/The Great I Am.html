      <p><strong>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. John
          8:58.</strong></p>
      <p>I AM means an eternal presence; the past, present, and future are alike with God. He sees the most remote
          events of past history and the far distant future with as clear a vision as we do those things which are
          transpiring daily. We know not what is before us, and if we did, it would not contribute to our eternal
          welfare. God gives us an opportunity to exercise faith and trust in the great I AM.... Our Saviour says, “Your
          father Abraham rejoiced</p>
      <p>to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad” (John 8:56). Fifteen hundred years before Christ laid off His royal
          robe, His kingly crown, and left His position of honor in the heavenly courts, assumed humanity, and walked a
          man among the children of men, Abraham saw His day, and was glad. “Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not
          yet ﬁfty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
          Abraham was, I am” (verses 57, 58)....</p>
      <p>Christ was using the great name of God that was given to Moses to express the idea of the eternal presence
          Isaiah also saw Christ, and his prophetic words are full of signiﬁcance. He says, “For unto us a child is
          born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
          Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace” (Isaiah 9:6). Speaking
          through him, the Lord says, “I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.... Fear not: for I am
          with thee.... I,</p>
      <p>even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.... Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.
          Yea,</p>
      <p>before the day was I am he.... I am the Lord, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King” (Isaiah
          <nobr>43:3-15)....</nobr></p>
      <p>When Jesus came to our world, He proclaimed Himself, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto
          the Father, but by me” (John 14:6)....</p>
      <p>The Lord must be believed and served as the great “I AM,” and we must trust implicitly in Him.<span
