    <h1>Under the Great Teacher</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things
          are become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17.</strong></p>
      <p>When true conversion takes place in the heart, it is made manifest in a transformation of character, for those
          who are converted become Christlike. Pride no longer lives in the heart, sin seems abominable. The converted
          soul hates the thing that depraves his moral sensibilities. He hates that which cruciﬁed the Lord of life and
          glory. Those who are truly converted grow in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and as
          knowledge of Christ increases, they see more clearly where their own weakness lies; they realize the deep
          depravity of their natures. They understand the strength of sin, and know the power of their old habits....
          They have daily a sense</p>
      <p>of their entire inability to do anything without the help of Jesus Christ, therefore they say to Him, “I cast
          my helpless soul upon Thee. ‘In my hand no price I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling.”’</p>
      <p>As the sinner beholds the Lamb of God, he sees more clearly what provision God has made to take away the sins
          of the world. He sees the sufﬁciency and adaptation of the Spirit of grace for every conﬂict. The mysterious
          provision for the taking away of sin is Jesus Christ.... “He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for
          our’s only,</p>
      <p>but also for the sins of the whole world” (1 John 2:2)....</p>
      <p>The true Christian will not refuse to practice <nobr>self-denial</nobr> for Christ’s sake. Those who are
          children of God are earnest workers; they are not slothful servants. There are no drones in the household of
          God. Every member of the household of faith has his work appointed to him.... If he is a learner in the school
          of Christ, he will learn</p>
      <p>how to give a testimony, how to pray, how to be a living witness for the Master....</p>
      <p>The true Christian will be a diligent and constant student. He will realize that he lacks wisdom, strength, and
          experience, and he will place his will and all his interests in the care of the great Teacher.<span
