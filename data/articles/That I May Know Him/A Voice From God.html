    <h1>A Voice From God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of
          mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. Acts 17:11.</strong></p>
      <p>To some the Word of God is uninteresting. The reason is, they have so long indulged in the bewitching stories
          to be found in the literature of the present day that they have no relish for the reading of God’s Word or for
          religious exercises. This reading disqualiﬁes the mind to receive sound Bible principles and to work out
          practical godliness....</p>
      <p>When reading the Bible with humble, teachable heart, we are holding intercourse with God Himself. The thoughts
          expressed, the precepts speciﬁed, the doctrines revealed, are a voice from the God of heaven. The Bible will
          bear to be studied, and the mind, if not bewitched by Satan, will be attracted and charmed.... The light
          which</p>
      <p>beams through the Scriptures is light from the eternal throne ﬂashed down to this earth....</p>
      <p>All who make the Word of God their guide in this life will act from principle. Those who are vacillating, vain,
          and extravagant in dress, who are gratifying the appetite and following the promptings of the natural heart,
          will, in obeying the teachings of God’s Word, become balanced. They will devote themselves to duty with an
          energy that never falters, and they will rise from one degree of strength to another. Their characters will be
          beautiful and fragrant and devoid of selﬁshness. They will make their way and be acceptable anywhere among
          those who love truth and righteousness.<span class="ft11">12</span></p>
      <p>The psalmist prayed, “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.” The Lord heard
          him, for how full of assurance are the words, “How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
          to my mouth!” “More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much ﬁne gold: sweeter also than honey and the
          honeycomb.” (Psalm 119:18, 103; 19:10.). And as the Lord heard and answered David, so He will hear and answer
          us, making our hearts full of gladness and rejoicing.<span class="ft11">13</span></p>
