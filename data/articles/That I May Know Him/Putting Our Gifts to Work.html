    <h1>Putting Our Gifts to Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. 1 Corinthians
          7:7.</strong></p>
      <p>God gives more than money to His stewards. Your talent of imparting is a gift. What are you communicating of
          the gifts of God, in your words, in your tender sympathy? ... The knowledge of truth is a talent. There are
          many souls in darkness that might be enlightened by true, faithful words from you. There are hearts that are
          hungering for sympathy, perishing away from God. Your sympathy may help them. The Lord has need of your words,
          dictated by His Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>The ﬁrst work for all Christians to do is to search the Scriptures with most earnest prayer, that they may have
          that faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul from every thread of selﬁshness. If the truth is received
          into the heart, it works like good leaven, until every power is brought into subjection to the will of God.
          Then you can no more help shining than can the sun....</p>
      <p>All natural gifts are to be sanctiﬁed as precious endowments. They are to be consecrated to God, that they may
          minister for the Master. All social advantages are talents. They are not to be devoted to
          <nobr>self-pleasing,</nobr> amusement, or <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation....</nobr> The gift of correct example is a
          great thing. But many gather about the soul</p>
      <p>an atmosphere that is malarious....</p>
      <p>The gifts of speech, of knowledge, of sympathy and love, communicate a knowledge of Christ. All these gifts are
          to be converted to God. The Lord stands in need of them, He calls for them. All are to act a part in preparing
          their own souls and the souls of others to rededicate their talents to God. Every soul, every gift, is to be
          laid under contribution to God. All are to cooperate with God in the work of saving souls. The talents you
          possess are given you of God to make you efﬁcient colaborers with Christ. There are hearts hungering for
          sympathy, perishing for the help and assistance God has given you to give to them.<span
