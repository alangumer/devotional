    <h1>Author and Teacher of Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the
          truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. John 18:37.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is the author of all truth. Every brilliant conception, every thought of wisdom, every capacity and
          talent of men, is the gift of Christ. He borrowed no new ideas from humanity, for He originated all. But when
          He came to earth He found the bright gems of truth which He had entrusted to man all buried up in superstition
          and tradition. Truths of most vital importance were placed in the framework of error, to serve the purpose of
          the arch deceiver.... But Christ swept away erroneous theories of every grade. No one save the world’s
          Redeemer</p>
      <p>had power to present the truth in its primitive purity, divested of the error that Satan had accumulated to
          hide its heavenly beauty.... The work of Christ was to take the truth of which the people were in want, and
          separate</p>
      <p>it from error and present it free from the superstitions of the world, that the people might accept it on its
          own intrinsic and eternal merit. He dispersed the mists of doubt, that the truth might be revealed and shed
          distinct rays of light into the darkness of men’s hearts.<span class="ft11">31</span></p>
      <p>The truth came from His lips clothed in new and interesting representations that gave it the freshness of a new
          revelation. His voice was never pitched to an unnatural key, and His words came with an earnestness and
          assurance appropriate to their importance and the momentous consequences involved in their reception or
          rejection.<span class="ft11">32</span></p>
      <p>He invited men to learn of Him, for He was a living representation of the law of God. He was the only one in
          human garb that could stand among a nation of witnesses, and looking round upon them, say, “Which of you
          convinceth me of sin?” (John 8:46). He knew that no man could point out any defect in His character or
          conduct. What power His spotless purity gave to His instructions, what force to His reproofs, what authority
          to His commands! ... He proved Himself to be the way, the truth, and the life.<span
