    <h1>It Will Not Be Long</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were
          for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. Isaiah 26:20.</strong></p>
      <p>It will not be long until the gathering storm will burst upon the world that is so asleep in sin.... When
          the</p>
      <p>earth is reeling to and fro like a drunkard, when the heavens are shaking, and the great day of the Lord has
          come, who shall be able to stand? One object they behold in trembling agony from which they will try in vain
          to escape. “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him” (Revelation 1:7). The unsaved utter
          wild imprecations to dumb <nobr>nature—their</nobr> god: “Mountains and rocks, ‘Fall on us, and hide us from
          the face of him that sitteth on the throne”’ (Revelation 6:16).</p>
      <p>Creation is loyal to her God, and deaf to the frenzied call. That unrequited love is now turned to wrath.
          Sinners who would not let Jesus take away their sins are rushing from place to place in search of a hiding
          place, crying, The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and our souls are not saved! ...</p>
      <p>That Lamb whose wrath will be so terrible to the scorners of His grace will be grace and righteousness and love
          and blessing to all who have received Him. The pillar of cloud that was dark with terror and avenging wrath to
          the Egyptians, was to the people of God a pillar of ﬁre for brightness. So will it be to the Lord’s people in
          these last days. The light and glory of God to His <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people are darkness to the
          unbelieving. They see that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The arm, long
          stretched, strong to save all who come unto Him, is strong to execute His judgment upon all who would not come
          unto Him that they might have life. God grant that while mercy still lingers, while the voice of invitation is
          still heard, there will be a turning unto the Lord. The sure provision has been made to shelter every soul and
          shield those who have kept His commandments until the indignation be overpast.<span
