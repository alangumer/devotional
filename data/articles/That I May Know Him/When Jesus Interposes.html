    <h1>When Jesus Interposes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the ﬁgures of the true; but
          into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Hebrews 9:24.</strong></p>
      <p>Our precious Redeemer is standing before the Father as our intercessor.... Let those who would meet the</p>
      <p>divine standard search the Scriptures for themselves, that they may have a knowledge of the life of Christ and
          understand His mission and work. Let them behold Him as their Advocate, standing within the vail, having in
          His hand the golden censer from which the holy incense of the merits of His righteousness ascends to God in
          behalf of those who pray to Him. Could they thus behold Him they would feel an assurance that they have a
          powerful, inﬂuential Advocate in the heavenly courts, and that their suit is gained at the throne of God.</p>
      <p>What an experience may be attained at the footstool of mercy, which is the only place of sure refuge! You may
          discern the fact that God is back of His promises, and not dread the issue of your prayers or doubt that Jesus
          is standing as your surety and substitute. As you confess your sins, as you repent of your iniquity, Christ
          takes your guilt upon Himself and imputes to you His own righteousness and power. To those who are contrite in
          spirit He gives the golden oil of love and the rich treasures of His grace. It is then that you may see that
          the sacriﬁce of self to God through the merits of Christ makes you of inﬁnite value, for clothed in the robe
          of Christ’s righteousness you become the sons and daughters of God. Those who ... ask forgiveness in the name
          of Jesus will receive their request. At the very ﬁrst expression of penitence Christ presents the humble
          suppliant’s petition before the throne as His own desire in the sinner’s behalf. He says, “I will pray the
          Father for you.”</p>
      <p>Jesus, our precious Saviour, could not see us exposed to the fatal snares of Satan and forbear making an
          inﬁnite sacriﬁce on our behalf. He interposes Himself between Satan and the tempted soul and says, “‘Get thee
          behind me, Satan.’ Let me come close to this tempted soul.” He pities and loves every humble, trembling
          suppliant.<span class="ft11">16</span></p>
