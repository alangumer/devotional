    <h1>The Fulﬁllment of God’s Purpose</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the
          church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
          Lord. Ephesians 3:10, 11.</strong></p>
      <p>We should consider that it was not merely to accomplish the redemption of man that Christ came to earth, it was
          not merely that the inhabitants of this little world might regard the law of God as it should be regarded, but
          it was to demonstrate to all the worlds that God’s law is unchangeable and that the wages of sin is
          death.</p>
      <p>There is a great deal more to this subject than we can take in at a glance. O that all might see the importance
          of carefully studying the Scriptures! Many seem to have the idea that this world and the heavenly mansions
          constitute the universe of God. Not so. The redeemed throng will range from world to world, and much of their
          time will be employed in searching out the mysteries of redemption. And throughout the whole stretch of
          eternity this subject will be continually opening to their minds. The privileges of those who overcome by the
          blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony are beyond comprehension.</p>
      <p>We have each to battle with the fallen foe.... Begin the warfare at once by gaining victories over self. Do
          not</p>
      <p>give place to the devil.... Throw all the weight of your inﬂuence on the side of Christ.</p>
      <p>When you look at the cross of Calvary you cannot doubt God’s love or His willingness to save. He has worlds
          upon worlds that give Him divine honor, and heaven and all the universe would have been just as happy if He
          had left this world to perish, but so great was His love for the fallen race that He gave His own dear Son to
          die that they might be redeemed from eternal death. As we see the care, the love, that God has for us, let us
          respond to it; let us give to Jesus all the powers of our being, ﬁghting manfully the battles of the Lord. We
          cannot afford to lose our souls; we cannot afford to sin against God. Life, eternal life in the kingdom of
          glory, is worth everything.<span class="ft11">34</span></p>
