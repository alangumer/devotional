    <h1>Soldiers of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
          left. 2 Corinthians 6:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The church of Christ may be ﬁtly compared to an army. The life of every soldier is one of toil, hardship, and
          danger. On every hand are vigilant foes, led on by the prince of the powers of darkness, who never slumbers
          and never deserts his post. Whenever a Christian is off his guard, this powerful adversary makes a sudden and
          violent attack. Unless the members of the church are active and vigilant, they will be overcome by his
          devices.</p>
      <p>What if half the soldiers in an army were idling or asleep when ordered to be on duty; the result would be
          defeat, captivity, or death. Should any escape from the hands of the enemy, would they be thought worthy of a
          reward? No; they would speedily receive the sentence of death. And is the church of Christ careless or
          unfaithful, far more important consequences are involved. A sleeping army of Christian
          <nobr>soldiers—what</nobr> could be more terrible! ...</p>
      <p>The Master calls for gospel workers. Who will respond? All who enter the army are not to be generals, captains,
          sergeants, or even corporals. All have not the care and responsibility of leaders. There is hard work of other
          kinds to be done. Some must dig trenches and build fortiﬁcations, some are to stand as sentinels, some to
          carry messages. While there are but few ofﬁcers, it requires many soldiers to form the rank and ﬁle of the
          army, yet its success depends upon the ﬁdelity of every soldier....</p>
      <p>There is earnest work to be done by us individually if we would ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. Eternal interests
          are at stake. We must put on the whole armor of righteousness, we must resist the devil, and we have the sure
          promise that he will be put to ﬂight. The church is to conduct an aggressive warfare, to make conquests for
          Christ, to rescue souls from the power of the enemy. God and holy angels are engaged in this warfare. Let us
          please Him who has called us to be soldiers.<span class="ft11">33</span></p>
