      <p><strong>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the
          Lord out of a pure heart. 2 Timothy 2:22.</strong></p>
      <p>I long to address the young men and women who are so willing to reach only cheap standards. O that the Lord
          might inﬂuence their minds to see what perfection of character is! O that they might know the faith that works
          by love and puriﬁes the soul! We are living in days of peril. Christ alone can help us and give us the
          victory. Christ must be all in all to us; He must dwell in the heart; His life must circulate through us, as
          the blood circulates through the veins. His Spirit must be a vitalizing power.<span

      <p>It is anything but wise, my young friends, to seek your own pleasure, to sow a crop of tares in foolish, sinful
          actions, which will not only lead others to do the same but will bring forth a bitter harvest for your own
          reaping. The Lord says: “... Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his ﬂesh
          shall of the ﬂesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting”
          (Galatians 6:7, 8). Youth is the sowing time, and the words and deeds of the early life are like seeds that
          will germinate and produce a harvest after their kind. Then why not sow seeds of kindness, of love, of faith,
          of patience, of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and true benevolence, and keep all your passions under control? Such
          sowing will produce a harvest after its kind. Let every word and deed be a seed that will result in good
          fruit.</p>
      <p>If you seek the help and grace of God, the Holy Spirit will take possession of mind and character and work in
          you that which you can work out with all safety to yourself, and with all beneﬁt to others.... The
          atmosphere</p>
      <p>that surrounds your soul will be of a pure, healthful character.<span class="ft15">26</span></p>
      <p>The Lord loves the youth. He sees in them great possibilities, and is ready to help them to reach a high
          standard if they will only realize the need of His help and lay a foundation of character that cannot be
          moved.<span class="ft27">27</span></p>
