    <h1>The Weight of God’s Wrath</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on
          him the iniquity of us all. Isaiah 53:6.</strong></p>
      <p>In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ suffered in man’s stead, and the human nature of the Son of God staggered
          under the terrible horror of the guilt of sin, until from His pale and quivering lips was forced the agonizing
          cry, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me”; but if there is no other way by which the
          salvation of fallen man may be accomplished, then “not as I will, but as thou wilt” (Matthew 26:39).</p>
      <p>The power that inﬂicted retributive justice upon man’s substitute and surety, was the power that sustained and
          upheld the suffering One under the tremendous weight of wrath that would have fallen upon a sinful world.
          Christ was suffering the death that was pronounced upon the transgressors of God’s law. It is a fearful thing
          for the unrepenting sinner to fall into the hands of the living God. This is proved by the history of the
          destruction of the old world by a ﬂood, by the record of the ﬁre which fell from heaven and destroyed the
          inhabitants of Sodom. But never was this proved to so great an extent as in the agony of Christ, ... when He
          bore the wrath of God for a sinful world....</p>
      <p>Man has not been made a <nobr>sin-bearer,</nobr> and he will never know the horror of the curse of sin which
          the Saviour bore. No sorrow can bear any comparison with the sorrow of Him upon whom the wrath of God fell
          with overwhelming force. Human nature can endure but a limited amount of test and trial. The ﬁnite can only
          endure the ﬁnite measure, and human nature succumbs; but the nature of Christ had a greater capacity for
          suffering; for the human existed in the divine nature, and created a capacity for suffering to endure that
          which resulted from the sins of a lost world. The agony which Christ endured, broadens, deepens, and gives a
          more extended conception of the character of sin, and the character of the retribution which God will bring
          upon those who continue in sin. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus
          Christ.<span class="ft17">35</span></p>
