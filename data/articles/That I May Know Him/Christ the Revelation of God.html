    <h1>Christ the Revelation of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
          declared him. John 1:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ came to the world to reveal the character of the Father and to redeem the fallen race. The world’s
          Redeemer was equal with God. His authority was as the authority of God. He declared that He had no existence
          separate from the Father. The authority by which He spoke and wrought miracles was expressly His own, yet He
          assures us that He and the Father are one....</p>
      <p>Jesus had imparted a knowledge of God to patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. The revelations of the Old
          Testament were emphatically the unfoldings of the gospel, the unveiling of the purpose and will of the inﬁnite
          Father. Through the holy men of old, Christ labored for the salvation of fallen humanity. And when He came to
          the world it was with the same message of redemption from sin, and restoration to the favor of God.<span

      <p>What speech is to thought, so is Christ to the invisible Father. He is the manifestation of the Father, and is
          called the Word of God. God sent His Son into the world, His divinity clothed with humanity, that man might
          bear the image of the invisible God. He made known in His words, His character, His power and majesty, the
          nature and attributes of God.<span class="ft11">2</span></p>
      <p>As legislator, Jesus exercised the authority of God; His commands and decisions were supported by the
          sovereignty of the eternal throne. The glory of the Father was revealed in the Son; Christ made manifest the
          character of the Father. He was so perfectly connected with God, so completely embraced in His encircling
          light, that he who had seen the Son had seen the Father. His voice was as the voice of God.... He says, “I am
          in</p>
      <p>the Father, and the Father in me.” “No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father,
          save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.” “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father” (John
          14:11; Matthew 11:27; 14:9).<span class="ft11">3</span></p>
