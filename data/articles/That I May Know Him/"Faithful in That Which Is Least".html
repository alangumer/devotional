    <h1>“Faithful in That Which Is Least”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least
          is unjust also in much. Luke 16:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The active service of God is directly connected with the ordinary duties of life, even its humblest
          occupations. We are to serve God just where He puts us. He is to place us individually, and not we ourselves.
          Perhaps service in the home life is the place we are to occupy for a time, if not always. Then a preparation
          for that work should be obtained, that we may do our best in service for the Lord.</p>
      <p>The Lord is testing and proving us to see what sort of timbers, or attributes, we are bringing into the
          character building. If we are listless and indifferent, negligent and careless, in the small, everyday duties
          we shall never be ﬁtted for any other service for God.... He that is unfaithful in that which is least would
          certainly repeat this</p>
      <p>unfaithfulness if placed in higher positions of trust and given larger responsibilities.... The service of God
          will</p>
      <p>be done in a haphazard manner....</p>
      <p>The importance of little things is underrated just because they are small, but the inﬂuence of the little
          things for good or evil is great. They supply much of the actual discipline of life for every human being.
          They are part of the training of the soul in the sanctiﬁcation of all our entrusted talents to God.
          Faithfulness in the little things in the line of duty makes the worker in God’s service reﬂect more and more
          the likeness of Christ.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour is a Saviour for the perfection of the whole man. He is not the God of part of the being only. The
          grace of Christ works to the disciplining of the whole human fabric. He made all. He has redeemed all. He has
          made the mind, the strength, the body as well as the soul, partaker of the divine nature, and all is His
          purchased possession. He must be served with the whole mind, heart, soul, and strength. Then the Lord will be
          gloriﬁed in His saints in even the common, temporal things with which they are connected. “Holiness unto the
          Lord” will be the inscription placed upon them.<span class="ft11">26</span></p>
