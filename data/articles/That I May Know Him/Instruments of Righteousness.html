    <h1>Instruments of Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto
          God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. Romans
          6:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has given you talents to use, and in using these talents as He intended they should be used, you will
          have increased aptitude and wisdom and clear spiritual eyesight to understand His work. Your mind and eyes
          must watch for His appearing, your ears open to hear the faintest whisperings of His voice. Your knees He has
          made; use them in kneeling in prayer. He is your strength. By faith take hold of the Unseen. Let your feet be
          shod with the preparation of the gospel for running obediently in the way of His commandments. Your tongue and
          voice are a talent given you of God to tell the story of His life, of His lessons, of His death, of His
          resurrection, of His ascension. Your bodily strength is to be devoted to the Master in ﬁghting the good ﬁght
          of faith on the battleﬁeld, overcoming His enemies with “It is written.” Your sympathies and energies belong
          to God. Use them to glorify your Redeemer....</p>
      <p>Cultivate the thought that you are not alone. All your steps are watched by the Lord. You are encompassed with
          vigilant angels.... As the angels ministered unto Jacob, so certainly will they minister unto all of the
          Lord’s</p>
      <p>humble, contrite ones....</p>
      <p>Reach up, higher and still higher, taking hold of one line of faith after another. Walk and work in love to God
          and the poor oppressed ones, and the Lord will be your helper. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye
          shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man” (John 1:51). Jesus
          the precious Saviour, the Son of the living God, is the ladder uniting the celestial world with the
          terrestrial. His divinity lays hold of the throne of God. His humanity touches the earth. His human arm
          encircles the entire human race. Through Jesus Christ the angelic ministrations in love, in comfort, in
          reproof, in light, reach us. O thank the Lord, for He is good, and His mercies endure forever!<span
