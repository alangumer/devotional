    <h1>And Jesus Prayed</h1>

      <p><strong>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in
          prayer to God. Luke 6:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The Majesty of heaven, while engaged in His earthly ministry, was often in earnest prayer. Frequently He spent
          the entire night thus. His spirit was sorrowful as He felt the power of the darkness of this world, and He
          left the busy city and the noisy throng to seek a retired place for intercession with His Father. The Mount of
          Olives was the favorite resort of the Son of God. Frequently, after the multitude had left Him for the
          retirement of the night, He rested not though weary with the labors of the day.... While the city was hushed
          in silence and</p>
      <p>His disciples had retired to obtain refreshment in sleep, His divine pleadings were ascending to His Father
          from the Mount of Olives, that His disciples might be kept from the evil inﬂuences which they would daily
          encounter in the world, and that His own soul might be strengthened and braced for the duties and trials of
          the coming day. All night, while His followers were sleeping, was their divine Teacher praying, while the dew
          and frost of night fell upon His bowed head....</p>
      <p>The example of Christ is left on record for His followers. Jesus was Himself a source of blessing and strength.
          He could heal the sick and raise the dead; He commanded even the tempests, and they obeyed Him; He was
          unsullied with corruption, a stranger to sin; yet He endured agony which required help and support from His
          Father, and He prayed often with strong crying and tears. He prayed for His disciples and for Himself, thus
          identifying Himself with the needs, the weaknesses, and the failings which are common to humanity. He was a
          mighty petitioner, not possessing the passions of our human, fallen natures, but compassed with like
          inﬁrmities, tempted in all points even as we are....</p>
      <p>Christ, our Example, turned to His Father in these hours of distress. He came to earth that He might provide a
          way whereby we could ﬁnd grace and strength to help in every time of need by following His example in
          frequent, earnest prayer.<span class="ft11">10</span></p>
