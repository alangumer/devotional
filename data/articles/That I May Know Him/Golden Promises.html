    <h1>Golden Promises</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart:
          for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts. Jeremiah 15:16.</strong></p>
      <p>In the night season I was before a company, [Ellen White is here describing a dream or night vision.] talking
          with them upon faith, and trying to make them understand that they were far behind in this respect.... They
          had</p>
      <p>a deﬁcient experience in the knowledge of God and their Redeemer. I was trying to show them that they must be
          able intelligently to voice the words of John, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
          world” (John 1:29), that they must behold Him as their sin bearer.</p>
      <p>Then the Word of God was opened before me in a most beautiful, striking light. Page after page was turned, and
          I read the gracious invitations and words of entreaty to seek God’s glory and God’s will, and all other things
          would be added. These invitations, promises, and assurances stood out as in golden letters. Why do you not
          grasp them? I said. Seek ﬁrst to know God before any other thing. Search the Scriptures. Feed on the words of
          Christ, which are spirit and life, and your knowledge will enlarge and expand. Study your Bible. Study not the
          philosophy contained in many books, but study the philosophy of the Word of the living God. Other literature
          is of little consequence when compared with this. Do not crowd into your minds so many things that are cheap
          and unsatisfying. In the Word of God is spread before you the richest banquet. It is the Lord’s table,
          abundantly provided, whereof you may eat and be satisﬁed.</p>
      <p>The promises of God stood out clear and distinct, as though placed in letters of gold. Why, oh, why are they
          not appreciated! Why is not the heart ﬁlled with thanksgiving and praise? Why are your tongues so silent?
          ...</p>
      <p>The talent of speech is misappropriated. Let the talent of choice words be given to God in thanksgiving and
          rejoicing, and this will glorify His name. Surrender self entirely to God. “Let the peace of God rule in your
          hearts ... ; and be ye thankful” (Colossians 3:15).<span class="ft11">23</span></p>
