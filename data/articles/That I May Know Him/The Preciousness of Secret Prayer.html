    <h1>The Preciousness of Secret Prayer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Psalm
          62:8.</strong></p>
      <p>A deep sense of our need and a great desire for the things for which we ask must characterize our prayers, else
          they will not be heard. But we are not to become weary and cease our petitions because the answer is not
          immediately received. “The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force” (Matthew
          11:12). The violence here meant is a holy earnestness, such as Jacob manifested. We need not try to work
          ourselves up into an intense feeling, but calmly, persistently, we are to press our petitions at the throne of
          grace. Our work is to humble our souls before God, confessing our sins, and in faith drawing nigh unto God....
          It is the</p>
      <p>design of God to reveal Himself in His providence and in His grace. The object of our prayers must be the glory
          of God, not the gloriﬁcation of ourselves....</p>
      <p>God has honored us by showing how greatly He values us. We are bought with a price, even the precious blood of
          the Son of God. When His heritage shall conscientiously follow the Word of the Lord, His blessing will rest
          upon them in answer to their prayers. “Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your
          heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and not your garments, and
          turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness” (Joel
          2:12, 13).<span class="ft11">28</span></p>
      <p>In secret prayer the soul should be laid bare to the inspecting eye of God.... How precious is secret</p>
      <p><nobr>prayer—the</nobr> soul communing with God! Secret prayer is to be heard only by the
          <nobr>prayer-hearing</nobr> God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of petitions. Calmly, yet fervently,
          the soul is to reach out after God; and sweet and abiding will be the inﬂuence emanating from Him who sees in
          secret, whose ear is open to the prayer arising from the heart. He who in simple faith holds communion with
          God will gather to himself divine rays of light to strengthen and sustain him in the conﬂict with Satan.<span
