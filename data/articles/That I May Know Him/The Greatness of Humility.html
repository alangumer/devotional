    <h1>The Greatness of Humility</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
          of the cross. Philippians 2:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ came to this world for no other purpose than to manifest the glory of God, that man might be uplifted by
          its restoring power. All power and grace were given to Him. His heart was a wellspring of living water, a
          <nobr>never-failing</nobr> fountain, ever ready to ﬂow forth in a rich, clear stream to those around Him. His
          whole life was spent in pure disinterested benevolence. His purposes were full of love and sympathy. He
          rejoiced that He could do more for His followers than they could ask or think. His constant prayer for them
          was that they might be sanctiﬁed through the truth, and He prayed with assurance, knowing that an almighty
          decree had been given before the world was made. He knew that the gospel of the kingdom would be preached in
          all the world; that truth, armed with the omnipotence of the Holy Spirit, would conquer in the contest with
          evil; and that the bloodstained banner would one day wave triumphantly over His followers.</p>
      <p>Yet Christ came in great humility. When He was here He pleased not Himself, but “humbled himself, and became
          obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” To His followers He says, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn
          of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:29)....</p>
      <p>From the root of true humility springs the most precious greatness of <nobr>mind—greatness</nobr> which leads
          men to conform to the image of Christ. Those who possess this greatness gain patience and trust in God. Their
          faith is invincible. Their true consecration and devotion keep self hidden. The words that fall from their
          lips are molded into expressions of Christlike tenderness and love. Having a sense of their own weakness, they
          appreciate the help which the Lord gives them, and they crave His grace that they may do that which is right
          and true. By their manner, their attitude, and their spirit, they carry with them the credentials of learners
          in the school of Christ.<span class="ft22">60</span></p>
