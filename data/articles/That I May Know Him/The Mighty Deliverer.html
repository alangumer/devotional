    <h1>The Mighty Deliverer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not
          good, after their own thoughts. Isaiah 65:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord God through Christ holds out His hand all the day long in invitations to the needy. He will receive
          all. He welcomes all. He rejects none. It is His glory to pardon the chief of sinners. He will take the prey
          from the mighty, He will deliver the captive, He will pluck the brand from the burning. He will lower the
          golden chain of His mercy to the greatest depths of human wretchedness and guilt and lift up the debased soul
          contaminated with sin. But man must will to come, and cooperate in the work of saving his soul by availing
          himself of opportunities given him of God. The Lord forces no one. The spotless wedding robe of Christ’s
          righteousness is prepared to clothe the sinner, but if he refuses it he must perish.<span

      <p>The record of the past can be blotted out with His [Christ’s] blood, the page made clean and white. “Come now,
          and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool” (Isaiah 1:18)....</p>
      <p>The words falling from the lips of Jesus, “Thy sins be forgiven thee” (Matthew 9:2), are worth everything to
          us. He saith, I have borne your sins in My own body on Calvary’s cross. He sees your sorrows. His hand is laid
          upon the head of every contrite soul, and Jesus becomes our Advocate before the Father, and our Saviour. The
          lowly, contrite heart will make very much of forgiveness and pardon....</p>
      <p>We may repeat His tender compassion for us to others who are wandering in the mazes of sin. The grace of Christ
          revealed to us must be tenderly revealed to others. A great tenderness and compassion will ﬁll the soul for
          human beings who are still under the control of Satan. Christ is to be multiplied in every man and woman who
          believes in Him, for they are to live over the life of Christ in blessing and enlightening and bringing hope
          and peace and joy to other hearts.<span class="ft11">24</span></p>
