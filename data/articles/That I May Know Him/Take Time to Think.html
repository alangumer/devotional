    <h1>Take Time to Think</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift up our heart with our hands
          unto God in the heavens. Lamentations 3:40, 41.</strong></p>
      <p>I would appeal to the youth to consider their ways, to take time to think, to weigh their actions....
          Compassed</p>
      <p>with temptation as you are, nothing will be sufﬁcient as a safeguard against evil except the indwelling of
          Christ in your hearts through faith in His righteousness. You must practice His virtues, making Him your daily
          pattern....</p>
      <p>Good character does not come by chance; it is formed by persevering, untiring effort. The youth should seek to
          make all that is possible of themselves, by improving every entrusted talent and capability to the glory of
          God. The world’s Redeemer says, “Without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5). Faith in Jesus Christ as your
          personal Saviour will give strength and solidity to your character. Those who have faith in Christ will be
          <nobr>sober-minded,</nobr> ever remembering that God’s eye is upon them, that angels of God are watching to
          see what manner of characters they will develop....</p>
      <p>Individually, probation is granted to you in order that you may form characters for the future, immortal life.
          Precious, golden moments are given you that you may improve them according to the light which the Lord has
          graciously permitted to shine upon you from the throne of His glory.... Christ is the greatest teacher the
          world</p>
      <p>ever knew. Where He abides in the heart by faith, His spirit will become a vitalizing agent to purify and
          vivify the soul....</p>
      <p>The truth in the heart will surely have a correcting inﬂuence on the character. Hold the truth as from God, as
          a treasure of the highest value, that must not be dimmed or tarnished by evil practices that are wholly out of
          harmony with its holy character. Under the divine inﬂuence of truth the mind will be strengthened, the
          intellect invigorated, and that which is useless will be discarded for that which is pure and beneﬁcial. Under
          the inﬂuence of truth the Christian character will develop through the knowledge of the only true God and
          Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.<span class="ft11">20</span></p>
