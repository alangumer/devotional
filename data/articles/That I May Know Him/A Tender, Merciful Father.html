    <h1>A Tender, Merciful Father</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. Psalm
          103:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Our God should be regarded as a tender, merciful father. The service of God should not be looked upon as a
          <nobr>heart-saddening,</nobr> distressing exercise. It should be a pleasure to worship the Lord and to take
          part in His work. As the people of God meditate upon the plan of salvation their hearts will be melted in love
          and gratitude....</p>
      <p>God would not have His children, for whom so great a salvation has been provided, act as though He were a hard,
          exacting taskmaster. He is their best friend, and when they worship Him, He expects to be with them to bless
          and comfort them and ﬁll their hearts with joy and love. The Lord desires His children to take comfort in His
          service, and to ﬁnd more pleasure than hardship in His work. The Lord desires that those who come to worship
          Him shall carry away with them precious thoughts of His care and love that they may be cheered in all the
          employments of daily life, that they may have grace to deal honestly and faithfully in all things....</p>
      <p>We dishonor God when we think of Him only as a judge ready to pass sentence upon us, and forget that He is a
          loving Father. The whole spiritual life is molded by our conceptions of God, and if we cherish erroneous views
          of His character, our souls will sustain injury. We should see in God one who yearns toward the children of
          men, longing to do them good.... All through the Scriptures, God is represented as one who calls, woos by
          His</p>
      <p>tender love, the hearts of His erring children. No earthly parent could be as patient with the faults and
          mistakes of their children as is God with those He seeks to save. No one could plead more tenderly with the
          transgressor. No human lips ever poured out more tender entreaty to the wanderer than does He. O shall we not
          love God, and show our love by humble obedience? Let us have a care for our thoughts, our experiences, our
          attitude toward God, for all His promises are but the breathings of unutterable love.<span
