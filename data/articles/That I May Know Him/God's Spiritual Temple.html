    <h1>God’s Spiritual Temple</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In whom all the building ﬁtly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also
          are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. Ephesians 2:21, 22.</strong></p>
      <p>The gospel is designed for all, and it will bring together in church capacity men and women who are different
          in training, in character, and in disposition. Among these will be some who are naturally slack, who feel that
          order is pride, and that it is not necessary to be so particular. God will not come down to their low
          standard....</p>
      <p>The people of God have a high and holy calling. They are Christ’s representatives. Paul addresses the church in
          Corinth as those who are “sanctiﬁed in Christ Jesus, called to be saints” (1 Corinthians 1:2)....</p>
      <p>If we have habits of speech and deportment that do not rightly represent the Christian religion we should at
          once set about the work of reform. As we represent Christ to the world, let us form such habits as will honor
          Him. Everywhere hidden from observation, agencies are at work to draw souls from Christ, and God would have
          still more powerful agencies at work among His people to attract souls to Christ.<span

      <p>The Jewish Temple was built of hewn stones quarried out of the mountains, and every stone was ﬁtted for its
          place in the Temple, hewed, polished and tested, before it was brought to Jerusalem. And when all were brought
          to the ground, the building went together without the sound of an ax or hammer. This building represents God’s
          spiritual temple, which is composed of material gathered out of every nation and tongue and people, of all
          grades, high and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant. These are not dead substances, to be ﬁtted by
          hammer and chisel. They are living stones quarried out from the world by the truth, and the great Master
          Builder, the Lord of the temple, is now hewing and polishing them and ﬁtting them for their respective places
          in the spiritual temple. When completed, this temple will be perfect in all its parts, the admiration of
          angels and of men, for its builder and maker is God. Truly, those who are to compose this glorious building
          are “called to be saints.”<span class="ft22">32</span></p>
