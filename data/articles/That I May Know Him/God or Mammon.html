    <h1>God or Mammon?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold
          to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Matthew 6:24.</strong></p>
      <p>You have, as an individual, a soul to save or to lose. And although Noah, Job, and Daniel were in the land they
          could save but their own souls through their righteousness. If you consider this it will help you to realize
          that you must be in earnest to apply your mind and all your powers day by day to secure proﬁtable
          results.</p>
      <p>The worshipers of the world make mammon their god, and everything else is subordinate to this worship. Should
          not the Christian keep in subordination the love of pleasure, the love of everything that is contrary to the
          interests of Jesus Christ? Precious time has not been given to be wasted on that which is less than nothing,
          and vanity. In thus doing we are cheating ourselves out of present peace in this life, and eternal happiness
          in the life to come....</p>
      <p>Do not make a low standard your aim; aim high. Never be found at any time working on the side of the great
          adversary of souls, who is seeking to counteract the workings of the Spirit of God. Walk not hesitatingly but
          ﬁrmly in the strength and grace of Jesus Christ.... You are the property of Christ both by creation and
          redemption,</p>
      <p>and the glory of God is involved in your individual success....</p>
      <p>You are a spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men. Be brave in God. Put on the whole armor of God and
          let your unbelieving father [From a letter to a youth whose father was an unbeliever.] see that your life is
          not spoiled because you stand loyal and true to all the commandments of God as a <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr>
          Adventist. You can be, and God requires you to be, a decided witness for Him.... Do not work at all on Satan’s
          side of the question.</p>
      <p>Probationary time is precious. Make the most of the golden moments, putting to use the talents God has given,
          that you may accumulate something for the Master and be a blessing to all around you. Let the heavenly angels
          look down with joy upon you because you are loyal and true to Jesus Christ.<span class="ft11">42</span></p>
