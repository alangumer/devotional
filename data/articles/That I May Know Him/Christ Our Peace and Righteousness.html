    <h1>Christ Our Peace and Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to
          Israel, and forgiveness of sins. Acts 5:31.</strong></p>
      <p>He who has the spotless robe of righteousness, woven in the loom of heaven, in which is not a thread that
          sinful humanity can claim, is at the right hand of God, to clothe His believing children in the perfect
          garment of His righteousness. Those who are saved in the kingdom of God will have nothing of which to boast in
          themselves; the praise and the glory will all ﬂow back to God....</p>
      <p>It is not now the work of the sinner to make peace with God, but to accept Christ as his peace and
          righteousness. Thus man becomes one with Christ and one with God. There is no way by which the heart may be
          made holy, save through faith in Christ. Yet many think that repentance is a kind of preparation which men
          must originate themselves before they can come to Christ. They must take steps themselves in order to ﬁnd
          Christ a mediator in their behalf. It is true that there must be repentance before there is pardon, but the
          sinner must come to Christ before he can ﬁnd repentance. It is the virtue of Christ that strengthens and
          enlightens the soul, so that repentance may be godly and acceptable.... Repentance is as certainly a gift of
          Jesus Christ as is</p>
      <p>forgiveness of sins. Repentance cannot be experienced without Christ, for it is the repentance of which He is
          the author that is the ground upon which we may apply for pardon. It is through the work of the Holy Spirit
          that men are led to repentance. It is from Christ that the grace of contrition comes, as well as the gift of
          pardon, and repentance as well as forgiveness of sins is procured only through the atoning blood of Christ.
          Those whom God pardons He ﬁrst makes penitent.<span class="ft11">19</span></p>
      <p>When the sinner accepts Christ and lives in Him, Jesus takes his sins and weaknesses and then grafts the
          repentant soul into Himself, so that he sustains the relation to Christ that the branch does to the vine. We
          have nothing, we are nothing, unless we receive virtue from Jesus Christ.<span class="ft11">20</span></p>
