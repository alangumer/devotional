    <h1>Simple Faith and Unquestioning Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
          children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
          Matthew 19:29.</strong></p>
      <p>Many are strongly convinced of the truth, but either husband or wife prevents their stepping out. How can one
          who is in fellowship with Christ’s sufferings refuse to obey His will and do His work? ... It is by following
          in the path of obedience in simple faith that the character attains perfection....</p>
      <p>Christ has promised us sufﬁcient power to reach this high standard. He says, “Whatsoever ye shall ask in my
          name, that will I do, that the Father may be gloriﬁed in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will
          do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
          Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive” (John
          <nobr>14:13-17).</nobr></p>
      <p>Consider this statement a moment. Why “cannot” the world receive the truth? “Because it seeth him not, neither
          knoweth him” (verse 17). The world is leagued against the truth, because it does not desire to obey the truth.
          Shall I, who perceive the truth, close my eyes and heart to its saving power because the world chooses
          darkness rather than light? Shall I bind myself up with the bundles of tares because my neighbors refuse to be
          bound up with the wheat? Shall I refuse light, the evidence of truth which leads to obedience, because my
          relatives and friends choose to follow in the paths of disobedience which lead away from God? Shall I close my
          mind against the knowledge of truth because my neighbors and friends will not open their understanding to
          discern the truth as it is in Jesus? Shall I refuse to grow in the grace and knowledge of my Lord and Saviour
          Jesus Christ because my neighbors consent to remain dwarfs? ...</p>
      <p>We cannot overestimate the value of simple faith and unquestioning obedience.<span class="ft15">29</span></p>
