    <h1>Truths That Transform</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any <nobr>two-edged</nobr> sword, piercing
          even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
          thoughts and intents of the heart. Hebrews 4:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The truths of the Bible, treasured in the heart and mind and obeyed in the life, convince and convert the soul,
          transform the character, and comfort and uplift the heart.... The Word makes the proud humble, the
          perverse</p>
      <p>meek and contrite, the disobedient obedient. The sinful habits natural to man are interwoven with the daily
          practice. But the Word cuts away the ﬂeshly lusts. It is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the mind.
          It divides the joints and marrow, cutting away the lusts of the ﬂesh, making men willing to suffer for their
          Lord.<span class="ft22">19</span>The service of Christ is a heavenly and holy and blessed thing. The Word is
          to be diligently searched, for the ministry of the Word discovers the imperfections in our characters and
          teaches us that the sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit is a work of heavenly devising, presenting in Christ Jesus the
          true perfection that if maintained will become a perfect whole in behalf of every soul. We are educated in
          Bible lines to become complete in Christlikeness and</p>
      <p>to see His Father’s face in Him who gave His own life for the saving of the soul.<span
          class="ft15">20</span></p>
      <p>If you are an intelligent Christian you will maintain religious vitality and will not be deterred by
          difﬁculties....</p>
      <p>You will work the works of God in gloom as well as in glory, in shade as well as in sunshine, in trial as well
          as in peace. The truth must be treasured up in your heart as well as incorporated in your being, so that no
          temptation and no argument can induce you to yield to Satan’s suggestions or devices. The truth is precious.
          It has wrought important changes upon the life and upon the character, exerting a masterly inﬂuence over
          words, deportment, thoughts, and experience. The soul who appreciates the truth lives under its inﬂuence and
          senses the tremendous realities of eternal things. He lives not to himself, but to Jesus Christ who died for
          him. To him, God lives and is very cognizant of all his words and actions.<span class="ft17">21</span></p>
