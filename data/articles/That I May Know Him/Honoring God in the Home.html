    <h1>Honoring God in the Home</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in
          psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. Colossians
          3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>This is what we need in our households. There is in it no <nobr>fault-ﬁnding,</nobr> no harshness; but peace,
          and joy, and rest in the Lord.... God calls for loving service. He calls upon parents to speak lovingly and
          tenderly to their</p>
      <p>children. Let them see that you think they help you. Give them responsibilities to bear, small ones at ﬁrst,
          and larger ones as they grow older. Never, never, let them hear you say of them, “They hinder me more than
          they help me.”...</p>
      <p>How many there are who forget that the home is a school in which children are trained to work either for Christ
          or Satan. Fathers and mothers, remember that every word you speak in the hearing of your children has an
          inﬂuence upon them, an inﬂuence either for good or for ill. Remember that if you ﬁnd fault with one another
          you are educating your children to ﬁnd fault.</p>
      <p>With your children around you, bow before the Father in heaven. Ask Him for help to guard the trust He has
          given you. Let your petitions be short and earnest. Say, “Heavenly Father, I want my children to be saved.
          Grant me the aid of Thy Spirit that I may so train them that they may be counted worthy to inherit eternal
          life.” Train your children to offer their simple words of prayer. Tell them that God delights to have them
          call upon Him.</p>
      <p>We can subdue our children only as we subdue ourselves. But there are so many parents who have brought with
          them into the home life their hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong. They have not left their
          childishness behind. They scold their children for things which should never be noticed. Parents, never scold
          your children. Deal ﬁrmly but kindly with them. Keep them busy. Make them feel that they are a part of the
          family ﬁrm, that they can help mother and father. Thank them for what they do for you.</p>
      <p>Let your home be a place where God is loved and honored.<span class="ft15">28</span></p>
