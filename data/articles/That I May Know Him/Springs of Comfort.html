      <p><strong>My soul shall be satisﬁed as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
          Psalm 63:5.</strong></p>
      <p>There is marrow and fatness for all who seek for truth as the miner seeks for gold. Who is it that God will
          instruct? Isaiah tells us: “Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I
          dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit
          of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah <nobr>57:15)—those</nobr> who see the
          evil of their unconverted characters, and repent, mourning over the life that has so poorly represented
          Christ....</p>
      <p>Gather the precious rays of light shining around you and focus them in one blaze upon the Word, and truths
          hidden from the casual reader will stand forth plainly and distinctly. All over the ﬁeld of revelation are
          scattered grains of <nobr>gold—the</nobr> sayings of the wisdom of God. If you are wise you will gather up
          these precious grains of truth. Make the promises of God your own. Then when test and trial come, these
          promises will be to you glad springs of heavenly comfort. As you study the Word, it will become to you a
          wellspring of wisdom. Thus you eat the ﬂesh and drink the blood of the Son of God.</p>
      <p>Ask God to reveal light and truth to you by His Holy Spirit, that you may understand what you read in His Word.
          When, after the resurrection, Christ walked with the disciples to Emmaus, He opened their understanding that
          they might understand the Scriptures. The same divine Teacher will enlighten our understanding if we keep the
          windows of the heart opened heavenward and closed earthward. The ofﬁce of the Holy Spirit is to bring all
          things to our remembrance and to guide us into all truth.</p>
      <p>The Lord loves us, and we are to love Him with the whole heart. Ask Him to guide you into all truth. He will do
          this. He longs to do it. He is waiting for you to ask Him with true humility and a ﬁrm belief that He will
          hear and answer you.<span class="ft11">24</span></p>
