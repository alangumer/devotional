    <h1>A New Song in Our Hearts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and
          shall trust in the Lord. Psalm 40:3.</strong></p>
      <p>He who believes in Christ becomes one with Christ, to show forth the glory of God, for God hath put a new song
          into his mouth, even praise unto the Lord. He daily desires to know more of Christ, that he may become more
          like Him. He discerns spiritual things and enjoys contemplation of Christ, and by beholding Him he is changed,
          imperceptibly to himself, into the image of Christ.... He does not place his dependence for acceptance</p>
      <p>with God upon what he can do, but relies wholly upon the merits of Christ’s righteousness. Yet he knows that he
          cannot be slothful and be a child of God. He searches the Scriptures that testify to him of Christ, that
          present before him the perfect Pattern....</p>
      <p>Precious truth is unfolded to his mind, and he receives it into the inner sanctuary of the soul. The
          attractions of the world become tame to him, for the glory and value of eternity are opened before him. He can
          say with the apostle, “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God” (1
          Corinthians 2:12)....</p>
      <p>He who has a genuine experience in the things of God will not be indifferent to those who are in darkness, but
          will inquire, What would Jesus say to these poor needy souls? He will seek to let his light shine forth. He
          will pray for wisdom, grace, and tact, that he may know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary. In
          place of engaging in triﬂing conversation, in jesting and joking, he will as a faithful steward of the grace
          of God, make the most of his opportunity, and the seed sown will spring up and bear fruit unto life eternal.
          The treasure of truth is in his heart, and he brings forth good things. The wellspring of life is in his soul,
          and the living waters ﬂow forth....</p>
      <p>Is this your experience? Are you growing up into Christ, your living head? ... O that the youth may consider
          the life of Christ, and copy the Pattern!<span class="ft15">1</span></p>
