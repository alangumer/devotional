    <h1>Christ Suffered, Being Tempted</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Hebrews
          2:16.</strong></p>
      <p>We need not place the obedience of Christ by itself, as something for which He was particularly adapted, by His
          particular divine nature, for He stood before God as man’s representative and was tempted as man’s substitute
          and surety. If Christ had a special power which it is not the privilege of man to have, Satan would have made
          capital of this matter. The work of Christ was to take from the claims of Satan his control of man, and He
          could do this only in the way that He <nobr>came—a</nobr> man, tempted as a man, rendering the obedience of a
          man.<span class="ft22">56</span></p>
      <p>Would that we could comprehend the signiﬁcance of the words, Christ “suffered being tempted” (Hebrews 2:18).
          While He was free from the taint of sin, the reﬁned sensibilities of His holy nature rendered contact with
          evil unspeakably painful to Him. Yet with human nature upon Him, He met the arch apostate face to face, and
          singlehanded withstood the foe of His throne. Not even by a thought could Christ be brought to yield to the
          power of temptation.</p>
      <p>Satan ﬁnds in human hearts some point where he can gain a foothold; some sinful desire is cherished, by means
          of which his temptations assert their power. But Christ declared of Himself, “The prince of this world cometh,
          and hath nothing in me” (John 14:30). The storms of temptation burst upon Him, but they could not cause Him to
          swerve from His allegiance to God.</p>
      <p>All the followers of Christ have to meet the same malignant foe that assailed their Master. With marvelous
          skill he adapts his temptations to their circumstances, their temperament, their mental and moral bias, their
          strong passions. He is ever whispering in the ears of the children of men, as he points to worldly pleasures,
          gains, or honors, “All this will I give you, if you will do my bidding.” We must look to Christ; we must
          resist as He resisted; we must pray as He prayed; we must agonize as He agonized, if we would conquer as He
          conquered.<span class="ft22">57</span></p>
