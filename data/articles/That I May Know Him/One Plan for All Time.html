      <p><strong>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. Acts
          15:11.</strong></p>
      <p>God’s truth is the same in all ages, although differently developed to meet the wants of His people in various
          periods. Under the Old Testament dispensation every important work was closely connected with the sanctuary.
          In the holy of holies the great I AM took up His abode.... There, above the mercy seat, overshadowed by
          the</p>
      <p>wings of the cherubim, dwelt the Shekinah of His glory, the perpetual token of His presence, while the
          breastplate of the high priest, set with precious stones, made known from the sacred precincts of the
          sanctuary the solemn message of Jehovah to the people. Wonderful dispensation, when the Holy One, the Creator
          of the heavens and the earth, thus manifested His glory, and revealed His will to the children of men!</p>
      <p>The typical sacriﬁces and offerings of that dispensation represented Christ, who was to become the perfect
          offering for sinful man. Besides these mystic symbols and shadowy types pointing to a Saviour to come, there
          was a present Saviour to the Israelites. He it was, who, enshrouded in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar
          of ﬁre by night, led them in their travels, and He it was who gave direct words to Moses to be repeated to the
          people....</p>
      <p>He who was equal with the Father in the creation of man was commander, lawgiver, and guide to His ancient
          people.<span class="ft15">7</span></p>
      <p>Many look upon the days of Israel as a time of darkness, when men were without Christ, without repentance and
          faith. Many hold the erroneous doctrine that the religion of the children of Israel consisted in forms and
          ceremonies in which faith in Christ had no part. But men in that age were saved by Christ as verily as men are
          saved by Him today.... Christ was shadowed forth in the sacriﬁces and symbols, which were to last till
          type</p>
      <p>should reach antitype in His coming to our world. The Hebrews rejoiced in a Saviour to come. We rejoice in a
          Saviour who has come, and who is coming again.... Christ’s blood avails for us, as it did for ancient
          Israel.<span class="ft17">8</span></p>
