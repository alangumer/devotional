    <h1>Filled With His Fullness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be ﬁlled with all the fulness of
          God. Ephesians 3:19.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many who think that it is impossible to escape from the power of sin, but the promise is that we may
          be ﬁlled with all the fullness of God. We aim too low. The mark is much higher. Our minds need expansion, that
          we may comprehend the signiﬁcance of the provision of God. We are to reﬂect the highest attributes of the
          character of God. We should be thankful that we are not to be left to ourselves. The law of God is the exalted
          standard to which we are to attain.... We are not to walk according to our own ideas... , but we are to follow
          in</p>
      <p>the footsteps of Christ.<span class="ft15">27</span></p>
      <p>The work of overcoming is in our hands, but we are not to overcome in our own name or strength, for of
          ourselves we cannot keep the commandments of God. The Spirit of God must help our inﬁrmities. Christ has
          become our sacriﬁce and surety. He has become sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
          Through faith in His name He imputes unto us His righteousness, and it becomes a living principle in our
          life.... Christ imputes to us His sinless character and presents us to the Father in His own purity.<span
          class="ft17">28</span></p>
      <p>We cannot provide a robe of righteousness for ourselves, for the prophet says, “All our righteousnesses are as
          ﬁlthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). There is nothing in us from which we can clothe the soul so that its nakedness
          shall not appear. We are to receive the robe of righteousness woven in the loom of heaven, even the spotless
          robe of Christ’s righteousness. We are to say, “He died for me. He bore my soul’s disgrace, that in His name I
          might be an overcomer and be exalted to His throne.”<span class="ft11">29</span></p>
      <p>It is privilege of the children of God to be ﬁlled with all the fullness of God. “Now unto him that is able to
          do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be
          glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end” (Ephesians 3:20, 21).<span
