    <h1>When Man Cooperates</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Philippians 2:13.
          “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
          him,</strong></p>
      <p>and will sup with him, and he with me” (Revelation 3:20). Thus the world’s Redeemer illustrates the work of the
          Holy Spirit upon the human heart. The living agent, by an act of faith of his own, places himself in the hands
          of the Lord for Him to work in him His good pleasure in His time. There must be a continual exercise of faith
          to be in Christ and keep in Christ, abiding by faith in Him.</p>
      <p>This is a training process, a constant discipline of the mind and heart, that Christ shall work His great work
          in human hearts. Self, the old natural self, dies, and Christ’s will is our will, His way is our way, and the
          human agent becomes, with heart, mind, and intellect, an instrument in the hands of God to work no more
          wickedness but the righteousness of Christ....</p>
      <p>In the divine arrangement God does nothing without the cooperation of man. He compels no man’s will. That must
          be given to the Lord completely, else the Lord is not able to accomplish His divine work that He would do
          through the human agency. Jesus declared that in a certain place He could not do many mighty works among the
          people because of their unbelief. He wanted to do for them in that place just what He knew that they needed to
          have done, but He could not because unbelief barred the way. The potter cannot mold and fashion unto honor
          that which has never been placed in his hands. The Christian life is one of daily surrender, submission, and
          continual overcoming, gaining fresh victories every day. This is the growing up into Christ, fashioning the
          life into the divine Model....</p>
      <p>Devotion, piety, and sanctiﬁcation of the entire man come through Jesus Christ our righteousness. The love of
          God needs to be constantly cultivated. O how my heart cries out to the living God for the mind of Jesus
          Christ! I want to lose sight of self.<span class="ft11">22</span></p>
