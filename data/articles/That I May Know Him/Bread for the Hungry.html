    <h1>Bread for the Hungry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that
          believeth on me shall never thirst. John 6:35.</strong></p>
      <p>Many are starved and strengthless because, instead of eating of the Bread which came down from heaven, they ﬁll
          their minds with things of minor importance. But if the sinner will partake of the Bread of Life, he will,
          regenerated and restored, become a living soul. The Bread sent down from heaven will infuse new life into his
          weakened energies. The Holy Spirit will take of the things of God and show them to him, and if he will receive
          them his character will be cleansed from all selﬁshness, and reﬁned and puriﬁed for heaven.</p>
      <p>To the careless, the indifferent, the unconcerned, those standing on the precipice of ruin, Christ says: Open
          the door of your heart; give Me entrance, and I will make you a child of God. I will transform your weak,
          sinful nature into the divine image, giving it beauty and perfection....</p>
      <p>Not only does Christ give us the Bread of Life, but the Water of Life, which He gives, is as a well of water,
          springing up into everlasting life. It possesses <nobr>life-giving</nobr> properties and purifying efﬁcacy for
          it proceeds from the throne of God.</p>
      <p>Those who will permit God to work in them will grow up unto the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus.
          Every power of the mind and body will be used in the service of God.... He has wonderful blessings to</p>
      <p>give to those who will receive Him. He is mighty in strength and wonderful in counsel. By the ministration of
          the Holy Spirit, He seeks to impress His image upon our characters. If we will feed upon Him we shall become
          new creatures in Christ Jesus. The virtues of a true Christian character, the excellences that are revealed in
          the character of Christ, will be seen in the life born of the Spirit. Man, with his human nature, will become
          a partaker of divinity. The power of Christ will work to sanctify every part of the being, diffusing life,
          activity, and soundness through the whole, and developing spiritual efﬁciency.<span
