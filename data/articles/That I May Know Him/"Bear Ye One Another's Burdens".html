      <p><strong>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in
          peace, be ye warmed and ﬁlled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body;
          what doth it proﬁt? James 2:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>Any neglect of duty to the needy and to the afﬂicted is a neglect of duty to Christ in the person of His
          saints. When the cases of all come in review before God, the question What did they profess? is never asked,
          but, What have they done? Have they been doers of the Word? Have they lived for themselves? or have they been
          exercised in works of benevolence, in deeds of kindness, in love preferring others before themselves, and
          denying themselves that they might bless others? If the record shows that this has been their life, that their
          characters have been marked with tenderness, <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and benevolence, they will receive the
          blessed assurance and benediction from Christ, “Well done.” ...</p>
      <p>Our spiritual strength and blessing will be proportionate to the labor of love and good works which we perform.
          The injunction of the apostle is, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulﬁl the law of Christ” (Galatians
          6:2). Keeping the commandments of God requires of us good works,
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr><nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> and devotion for the good of others, not that our good
          works alone can save us, but that we surely cannot be saved without good works. After we have done all that we
          are capable of doing we are then to say, We have done no more than our duty, and at best are unproﬁtable
          servants, unworthy of the smallest favor from God. Christ must be our righteousness....</p>
      <p>All around us there are those who have soul hunger and who long for love expressed in words and deeds. Friendly
          sympathy and real feelings of tender interest for others would bring to our souls blessings that we have never
          yet experienced, and would bring us into close relation to our Redeemer, whose advent to the world was for the
          purpose of doing good, and whose life we are to copy. What are we doing for Christ?<span
