    <h1>The Motive for Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 1
          John 5:3.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the keeping of the commandments of God that honors and gloriﬁes Him in His chosen. Wherefore every soul
          to whom God has given reasoning faculties is under obligation to God to search the Word and ascertain all that
          is enjoined upon us as God’s purchased possession. We should seek to understand all that the Word requires of
          us.... We cannot show greater honor to our God, whose we are by creation and redemption, than to</p>
      <p>give evidence to the beings of heaven, to the worlds unfallen, and to fallen men, that we diligently hearken
          unto all His commandments, which are the laws that govern His kingdom.</p>
      <p>We need to study diligently that we may gain a knowledge of the laws of God. How can we be obedient subjects if
          we fail to understand the laws that govern the kingdom of God? Then open your Bibles and search for everything
          that will enlighten you in regard to the precepts of God; and when you discern a Thus saith the Lord, ask not
          the opinion of men, but whatever the cost to yourself, obey cheerfully. Then the blessing of God will rest
          upon you....</p>
      <p>Often ask prayerfully, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Am I in any way disregarding the divine precepts?
          Am I in any way placing my inﬂuence on the enemy’s side? Am I showing a careless disregard of God’s
          commandments? Am I willing to yoke up with Christ, to lift the burdens, and to be a <nobr>co-laborer</nobr>
          with Him? Am I studying out possible excuses for neglecting obedience to a Thus saith the Lord? Am I risking
          the consequences of neglect to obey the clearly revealed precepts of Jehovah because I am not willing to come
          out from the world and be separate? Shall the fear of man have a greater inﬂuence over me than the fear of
          God?”</p>
      <p>Surrender yourself to God, saying, “‘Here, Lord, I give myself away; ‘tis all that I can do.’ I will not be
          found in disobedience to Thy law, for that would place me in the enemy’s ranks.”<span
