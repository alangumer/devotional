    <h1>Pledge of Divine Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto
          me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts
          1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>On the day of Pentecost the Inﬁnite One revealed Himself in power to the church. By His Holy Spirit He
          descended from the heights of heaven as a rushing mighty wind to the room in which the disciples were
          assembled. Words of penitence and confession of sin were mingled with songs of praise for sins forgiven. Words
          of thanksgiving and of prophecy were heard. All heaven was bending low to behold and adore the wisdom of
          matchless, incomprehensible love.</p>
      <p>The apostles and disciples were lost in wonder, and exclaimed, “Herein is love!” They grasped the imparted
          gift. Their hearts were surcharged with a benevolence so full, so deep, so <nobr>far-reaching,</nobr> that it
          impelled them to go to the ends of the earth testifying, God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross of
          our Lord Jesus Christ. They were ﬁlled with an intense longing to add to the church such as should be
          saved....</p>
      <p>As the disciples went forth to proclaim the gospel, ﬁlled with the power of the Spirit, so God’s servants are
          to go forth today. All around us are ﬁelds white unto the harvest. These ﬁelds are to be reaped. We are to
          take up the work, ﬁlled with an unselﬁsh desire to give the message of mercy to those who are in the darkness
          of error and unbelief. God will move on the hearts of believers to carry forward His work to the regions
          beyond....</p>
      <p>The Lord God is bound by an eternal pledge to supply power and grace to every one who is sanctiﬁed through
          obedience to the truth. Jesus Christ, to whom is given all power in heaven and on earth, unites in sympathy
          with His <nobr>instrumentalities—the</nobr> earnest souls who day by day partake of the living bread “which
          cometh down from heaven” (John 6:33). The church on earth, united with the church in heaven, can accomplish
          all things.<span class="ft22">4</span></p>
