    <h1>True Christian Culture</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in
          sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
          heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Ephesians <nobr>2:4-6.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>If you come into close relationship to Jesus Christ you see wondrous things out of His law that are not now
          seen. The softening, subduing inﬂuence of the Spirit of God upon human hearts and minds will make the true
          children of God to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Christian culture will be carried on in
          every heart worked by the Holy Spirit. There will be a soft, subdued spirit in all those who are looking unto
          Jesus. The love of Jesus always leads to Christian courtesy, reﬁnement of language, and purity of expression
          that testify the company we are <nobr>with—that</nobr> like Enoch we are walking with God. There is no
          storming, no harshness, but a sweet fragrance in speech and in spirit.</p>
      <p>The Word is to be our study. Here is a mine of precious ore. Much of it has been glimpsed at, but there is the
          digging to be done to secure much more precious treasures. There have been many who have just rummaged over
          the surface in a most careless, slovenly manner, when others are searching more carefully and prayerfully and
          perseveringly, and hidden, inestimable treasures are found....</p>
      <p>Let it be seen that your life is hid with Christ in God. Let there be no hasty speech, no cheap words, no slang
          phrases. Let it be demonstrated that you are conscious of a Companion whom you honor, and that you will not
          make Him ashamed of you. Only think, we are representatives of Jesus Christ! Then represent His character in
          words, in deportment.... The converting power of God is needed every day to sanctify and ﬁt vessels for
          the</p>
      <p>Master’s use. O there are precious lessons in the Holy Book that we are yet to ﬁnd and practice! Our conscience
          must recognize and revere a higher standard of Christianity .... You may be all light in the Lord. You may
          be</p>
      <p>increasing in efﬁciency, in purity, in the knowledge of God, if you keep meek and lowly of heart.<span
