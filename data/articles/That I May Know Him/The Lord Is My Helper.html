    <h1>The Lord Is My Helper</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my
          helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Hebrews 13:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>We must ﬁght every day, every hour, the good ﬁght of faith. You will meet with many trials, but if you bear
          them patiently they will reﬁne and purify, ennoble and elevate you spiritually.... Very great troubles are
          coming</p>
      <p>upon the world, and the powers of Satan are stirring with intensity the powers from beneath to work suffering,
          disaster, and ruin. His work is to create all the misery upon human beings that is possible. The earth is the
          scene of his action, but he is held in check. He can go no farther than the Lord permits.</p>
      <p>O how gracious is our Lord! “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). “I have graven thee
          upon the palms of my hands” (Isaiah 49:16).... “I will not leave you comfortless” (John 14:18). The Holy
          Spirit</p>
      <p>is to be given for the asking. Only think of it, He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
          Him than parents are to give good gifts unto their children. Then let us rejoice, let us be glad. Let us not
          look at the hellish work of the powers of darkness until hope and courage shall fail. Jesus lives, and we must
          let our faith pierce the blackness ... and rest in the light, rejoice in the light of the Sun of
          Righteousness.</p>
      <p>Jesus lives to make intercession for us. While the blackness and darkness are closing about the world, our
          lives are only secure as they are hid with Christ in God. Precious Saviour! In Him alone are our hopes of
          eternal life to be centered. We will then talk faith, talk hope, talk courage, and diffuse light on every
          side. “Ye are,” saith Christ, “the light of the world. A city ... set on an hill.... Let your light so shine
          before men, that they may ...</p>
      <p>glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew <nobr>5:14-16).</nobr> Faith must pierce the darkest cloud.
          Simple, earnest trust in God will glorify His name, and in that trust you may be all light in the Lord. Praise
          the Lord. Praise Him, and glorify God for His matchless love.<span class="ft15">7</span></p>
