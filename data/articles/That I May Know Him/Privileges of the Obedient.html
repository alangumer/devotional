    <h1>Privileges of the Obedient</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. John 15:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who live in close fellowship with Christ will be promoted by Him to positions of trust. The servant who
          does the best he can for his Master is admitted to familiar intercourse with the One whose commands he loves
          to obey. In the faithful discharge of duty we may become one with Christ, for those who are obeying God’s
          commands may speak to Him freely. The one who talks most familiarly with his divine leader has the most
          exalted conception of His greatness and is the most obedient to His commands.</p>
      <p>“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you....
          Ye</p>
      <p>are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
          not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have
          made known unto you.” ...</p>
      <p>The character of the one who comes to God in faith will bear witness that the Saviour has entered into his
          life, directing all, pervading all. Such a one is continually asking, “Is this Thy will and way, O my
          Saviour?” Constantly he looks to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of his faith. He consults the will of his
          divine Friend in reference to all his actions, for he knows that in this conﬁdence is his strength. He has
          made it a habit to lift up the heart to God in every perplexity....</p>
      <p>He who accepts God as his sovereign must take the oath of allegiance to Him. He must put on the Christian
          uniform and bear aloft the banner that shows to whose army he belongs. He must make an open avowal of his
          allegiance to Christ. Concealment is impossible. Christ’s impress must appear in the life in sanctiﬁed
          works.</p>
      <p>“I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people.... Ye shall be holy unto me; for I
          the</p>
      <p>Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine” (Leviticus
          <nobr>20:24-26)....</nobr> “This</p>
      <p>people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise” (Isaiah 43:21).<span
