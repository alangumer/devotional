    <h1>The Terms of Our Salvation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in
          my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. John 16:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>The disciples of Christ who were with Him from day to day did not comprehend His mission.... They were</p>
      <p>unacquainted with His unlimited resources and power. Although they had witnessed His miracles they did not
          discern His relationship to the Father. Just before His death He said to them, “Hitherto have ye asked nothing
          in my name.” In simple language Jesus explained to them that the secret of their success would be in asking
          the Father for strength and grace in His name. He would be present before the face of the Father to make
          request in their behalf....</p>
      <p>We need to become better acquainted with the terms upon which salvation will be ours, and better understand the
          relation which Christ sustains to us and to the Father. He has pledged Himself to honor His Son’s name as we
          present it at the throne of grace. We should consider the great sacriﬁce that was made in our behalf to
          purchase for us the robe of righteousness woven in the loom of heaven. He has invited us to the wedding feast,
          and has provided for every one of us the wedding garment. The robe of righteousness has been purchased at
          inﬁnite cost, and how daring is the insult to Heaven when one presents himself as a candidate for entrance at
          the wedding feast when wearing his own citizen’s dress of <nobr>self-righteousness!</nobr> How greatly he
          dishonors God, openly showing contempt for the sacriﬁce made on Calvary! ...</p>
      <p>No one will taste of the marriage supper of the Lamb who has not on a wedding garment. But John writes, “... He
          that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book
          of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.” Then, before it is eternally
          too late, let each one go to the heavenly Merchantman for the white raiment, the eyesalve, the gold tried in
          the ﬁre, and the oil of heavenly grace.<span class="ft11">17</span></p>
