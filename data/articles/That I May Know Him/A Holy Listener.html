    <h1>A Holy Listener</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>There is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. Psalm
          139:4.</strong></p>
      <p>Every hour of the day we should realize that the Lord is near, that He sees all we do, and hears every word we
          utter.... Cheap, earthly, unchristian words may be represented as “strange ﬁre,” and with this God can
          have</p>
      <p>nothing to do. The loud, boisterous laugh is a denial of God in the soul, for it reveals that the truth is not
          ruling in the heart.... By our vain words and unchristian example we dishonor God, and imperil not only our
          own souls</p>
      <p>but also the souls of those with whom we associate.</p>
      <p>The example which Christ has given to the world forbids all levity and cheapness, and if the life is made
          fragrant by the grace of God, these elements will not appear. A genuine cheerfulness, an uplifting inﬂuence,
          will ﬂow forth from all who love God and keep His commandments. And this carries with it a convincing,
          converting power. “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12), says the apostle.
          Why with fear and trembling? Lest you shall in any way misrepresent your holy faith by lightness, by triﬂing,
          by jesting or joking, and thus give others the impression that the truth which you profess has no sanctifying
          inﬂuence upon the character.<span class="ft11">14</span></p>
      <p>As followers of Christ we should make our words such as to be a help and an encouragement to one another in the
          Christian life. Far more than we do, we need to speak of the precious chapters in our experience. We should
          speak of the mercy and <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> of God, of the matchless depths of the Saviour’s love. Our
          words should be words of praise and thanksgiving. If the mind and heart are full of the love of God, this will
          be revealed in the conversation.... Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, unselﬁsh
          purposes, yearnings</p>
      <p>for piety and holiness, will bear fruit in words that reveal the character of the heart treasure. When Christ
          is thus revealed in our speech, it will have power in winning souls to Him.<span class="ft15">15</span></p>
