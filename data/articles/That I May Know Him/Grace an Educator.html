    <h1>Grace an Educator</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
          ...</strong></p>
      <p>who shall also conﬁrm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1
          Corinthians <nobr>1:4-8.</nobr></p>
      <p>In this world we have temporal duties to perform, and in the performance of these duties we are forming
          characters that will either stand the test of the judgment or be weighed in the balances and found wanting. We
          may do the smallest duties nobly, ﬁrmly, faithfully, as if seeing the whole heavenly host looking upon us.
          Take a lesson from the gardener. If he wishes a plant to grow he cultivates and trims it; he gives water, he
          digs about its roots, plants it where the sunshine will fall upon it, and day by day he works about it; and
          not by violent efforts, but by acts constantly repeated, he trains the shrub until its form is perfect and its
          bloom is full.</p>
      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ works upon the heart and mind as an educator. The continued inﬂuence of His
          Spirit upon the soul trains and molds and fashions the character after the divine model. Let the youth bear in
          mind that a repetition of acts, forms habits, and habit, character.... Is the love of Christ a living, active
          agent</p>
      <p>in your soul, correcting, reforming, reﬁning you, and purifying you from your wrong practices? There is need of
          cultivating every grace that Jesus through His suffering and death has brought within your reach. You are to
          manifest the grace that has been so richly provided for you, in the small as well as in the large concerns of
          life....</p>
      <p>Great truths can be brought into little things, and religion can be carried into the little as well as into the
          large concerns of life.</p>
      <p>The commandments of God are exceeding broad, and the Lord is not pleased to have His children disorderly, to
          have their lives marred by defects and their religious experience crippled, their growth in grace dwarfed,
          because they persist in cherishing hereditary and cultivated deﬁciencies in wrong habits that will be imitated
          by others and thus be perpetuated. If the grace of Christ cannot remedy these defects, what then constitutes
          transformation of character?<span class="ft11">38</span></p>
