    <h1>The Most Proﬁtable Investment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul
          knoweth right well. Psalm 139:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Only one lease of life is granted us here, and the inquiry with every one should be, How can I invest my life
          that it may yield the greatest proﬁt? Life is valuable only as we improve it for the beneﬁt of our fellow
          creatures and the glory of God. Careful cultivation of the abilities with which the Creator has endowed us
          will ﬁt us for usefulness here and eternal life in the world to come.</p>
      <p>That time is well spent which is directed to the establishment and preservation of sound physical and mental
          health.... It is easy to lose health, but it is difﬁcult to regain it....</p>
      <p>We can ill afford to dwarf or cripple a single function of mind or body by overwork or by abuse of any part of
          the living machinery. So sure as we do this, we must suffer the consequences. It is our ﬁrst duty to God and
          our fellow beings to develop all our powers. Every faculty with which the Creator has endowed us should be
          cultivated to the highest degree of perfection, that we may be able to do the greatest amount of good of which
          we are capable. The grace of Christ is needed to reﬁne and purify the mind; this will enable us to see and
          correct our deﬁciencies, and to improve that which is excellent in our characters. This work, wrought for
          ourselves in the strength and name of Jesus, will be of more beneﬁt to society than any sermon we might
          preach. The inﬂuence of a <nobr>well-balanced,</nobr><nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life is of inestimable
          value....</p>
      <p>There are few as yet who are aroused sufﬁciently to understand how much their habits of diet have to do with
          their health, their characters, their usefulness in this world, and their eternal destiny. The appetite should
          ever be in subjection to the moral and intellectual organs. The body should be servant to the mind, and not
          the mind to the body. All should understand in regard to their own physical frames, that with the psalmist
          they may be able to exclaim, “I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”<span
