    <h1>God in Human Flesh</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Word was made ﬂesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
          begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. John 1:14.</strong></p>
      <p>When we want a deep problem to study, let us ﬁx our minds on the most marvelous thing that ever took place in
          earth or <nobr>heaven—the</nobr> incarnation of the Son of God.<span class="ft15">37</span></p>
      <p>Christ alone was able to represent the Deity.... God Himself must be revealed to humanity. In order to do</p>
      <p>this, our Saviour clothed His divinity with humanity. He employed the human faculties, for only by adopting
          these could He be comprehended by humanity. Only humanity could reach humanity. He lived out the character of
          God through the human body which God had prepared for Him.<span class="ft11">38</span></p>
      <p>Had Christ come in His divine form, humanity could not have endured the sight. The contrast would have been too
          painful, the glory too overwhelming. Humanity could not have endured the presence of one of the pure, bright
          angels from glory; therefore Christ took not on Him the nature of angels; He came in the likeness of men.<span
          class="ft11">39</span></p>
      <p>Looking upon Him, we behold the invisible God, who clothed His divinity with humanity in order that through
          humanity He might shed forth a subdued and softened glory, so that our eyes might be enabled to rest upon Him,
          and our souls not be extinguished by His undimmed splendor. We behold God through Christ, our Creator and
          Redeemer. It is our privilege to contemplate Jesus by faith, and see Him standing between humanity and the
          eternal throne. He is our Advocate, presenting our prayers and offerings as spiritual sacriﬁces to God. Jesus
          is the great sinless propitiation, and through His merit God and man may hold converse together.</p>
      <p>Christ has carried His humanity into eternity. He stands before God as the representative of our race. When we
          are clothed with the wedding garment of His righteousness, we become one with Him, and He says of us, “They
          shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy” (Revelation 3:4). His saints will behold Him in His glory,
          with no dimming veil between.<span class="ft11">40</span></p>
