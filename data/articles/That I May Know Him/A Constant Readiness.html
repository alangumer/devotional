    <h1>A Constant Readiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Matthew 24:44.
          We are incapable of looking into the future, which often causes us disquietude and unhappiness. But one of the
          greatest evidences we have of the <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> of God is His concealment of the events of the
          morrow. Our ignorance of tomorrow makes us more vigilant and earnest today. We cannot see what is before us.
          Our <nobr>best-laid</nobr> plans sometimes seem to be unwise and faulty. We think, “If we only knew the
          future!” But God would have His children trust in Him and be ready to go where He shall lead them. We know not
          the precise time when our Lord shall be revealed in the clouds of heaven, but He has told us that our only
          safety is in a constant <nobr>readiness—a</nobr> position of watching and waiting. Whether we have one year
          before us, or ﬁve, or ten, we are to be faithful to our trust today. We are to perform each day’s duties as
          faithfully as though that day were to be our</strong></p>
      <p>last.</p>
      <p>We are not doing the will of God if we wait in idleness. To every man He has given his work, and He expects
          each one to do his part with ﬁdelity.... As never before, resistance must be made against
          <nobr>sin—against</nobr> the powers</p>
      <p>of darkness. The time demands energetic and determined activity on the part of those who believe present truth.
          They should teach the truth by both precept and example.</p>
      <p>If the time seems long to wait for our Deliverer to come, if, bowed by afﬂiction and worn with toil, we feel
          impatient for our commission to close, and to receive an honorable release from the warfare, let us
          <nobr>remember—and</nobr> let the remembrance check every <nobr>murmur—that</nobr> God leaves us on earth to
          encounter storms and conﬂicts, to perfect Christian character, to become better acquainted with God our Father
          and Christ our Elder Brother, and to do work for the Master in winning many souls to Christ, that with glad
          heart we may hear the words “Well done, good and faithful servant; ... enter thou into the joy of thy lord”
          (Matthew 25:23).<span class="ft17">21</span></p>
