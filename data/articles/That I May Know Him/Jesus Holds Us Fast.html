    <h1>Jesus Holds Us Fast!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and
          they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. John 10:27, 28.</strong></p>
      <p>In the courts above, Christ is pleading for His <nobr>church—pleading</nobr> for those for whom He has paid the
          redemption price of His blood. Centuries, ages, can never lessen the efﬁcacy of His atoning sacriﬁce. Neither
          life nor death, height nor depth, can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus; not because
          we hold Him so ﬁrmly, but because He holds us so fast. If our salvation depended on our own efforts, we could
          not be saved; but it depends on the One who is behind all the promises. Our grasp on Him may seem feeble, but
          His love is that of an elder brother; so long as we maintain our union with Him, no one can pluck us out of
          His hand.<span class="ft11">20</span></p>
      <p>Jesus, precious Jesus, “merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy
          for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty”
          (Exodus 34:6, 7). O how privileged we are that we may come to Jesus just as we are and cast ourselves upon His
          love! We have no hope but in Jesus. He alone can reach us with His hand to lift us up out of the depths of
          discouragement and hopelessness and place our feet upon the Rock. Although the human soul may cling to Jesus
          with all the desperate sense of his great need, Jesus will cling to the souls bought by His own blood with a
          ﬁrmer grasp than the sinner clings to Him.</p>
      <p>I read this over and over again, for it is so full of assurance: “Seeing then that we have a great high priest,
          that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an
          high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our inﬁrmities; but was in all points tempted like as
          we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
          ﬁnd grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews <nobr>4:14-16)....</nobr> What a Saviour we <nobr>have—a</nobr>
          risen Saviour, One who can save all</p>
      <p>who come unto Him!<span class="ft15">21</span></p>
