    <h1>The Science of Holiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the
          coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. 1 Thessalonians 3:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The ethics inculcated by the gospel acknowledge no standard but the perfection of God’s mind, God’s will. God
          requires from His creatures conformity to His will. Imperfection of character is sin, and sin is the
          transgression of the law. All righteous attributes of character dwell in God as a perfect, harmonious whole.
          Every one who receives Christ as his personal Saviour is privileged to possess these attributes. This is the
          science of holiness....</p>
      <p>The glory of God is His character.... This character was revealed in the life of Christ. That He might by
          His</p>
      <p>own example condemn sin in the ﬂesh, He took upon Himself the likeness of sinful ﬂesh. Constantly He beheld the
          character of God; constantly He revealed this character to the world. Christ desires His followers to reveal
          in their lives this same character.<span class="ft11">5</span></p>
      <p>Before the world, God is developing us as living witnesses to what men and women may become through the grace
          of Christ. We are enjoined to strive for perfection of character. The divine Teacher says, “Be ye therefore
          perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). Would Christ tantalize us by
          requiring of us an impossibility? Never, never! What an honor He confers upon us in urging us to be holy in
          our sphere, as the Father is holy in His sphere! He can enable us to do this, for He declares, “All power is
          given unto me in heaven and in earth” (Matthew 28:18). This unlimited power it is our privilege to
          claim....</p>
      <p>God works with those who properly represent His character. Through them His will is done on earth as it is done
          in heaven....</p>
      <p>It is our lifework to be reaching forward to the perfection of Christian character, striving constantly for
          conformity to God’s will. Day by day we are to press upward, ever upward, until of us it can be said, “Ye are
          complete in him” (Colossians 2:10).<span class="ft11">6</span></p>
