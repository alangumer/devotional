    <h1>The Religion of Little Things</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>His Lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few
          things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew
          25:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Said Christ, “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much” (Luke 16:10). In the little
          matters some do not think it necessary to be so very exact, but this is the deception of Satan.</p>
      <p>Selﬁshness is at the root of all unfairness and all lack of ﬁdelity.... There is with many of the youth
          who</p>
      <p>profess to believe the truth a vanity, pride, proﬂigacy, and carelessness that are making them reckless and
          disqualifying them for a noble and elevated life here, and unﬁtting them for the future life hereafter....
          There</p>
      <p>is not with all a careful improvement of the time for which they are paid. Those who fritter away their time or
          fail to put it to the best use are robbing God. Some ... have a very favorable opinion of those who are
          careless, reckless of money and reckless of time, but God regards all these things in their true
          <nobr>character—frauds</nobr> which He will avenge.</p>
      <p>Time, talents, and skill are to be brought into use and put to the very best account.... Let every one be
          true</p>
      <p>to principle, as if the eye of the Inﬁnite was upon him. You may, young men and women, make of yourselves what
          you will, by the grace of God combined with earnest efforts and determined will to resist inclination to
          indulgence....</p>
      <p>Christ gave to man a perfect example, but those who move out on what they call a liberal plan, and become
          careless in the little matters, will soon show a wide deviation from Christ’s example, the only true pattern.
          Young men and women, will you study more closely and prayerfully the life of Christ, and make that life your
          criterion, your standard?<span class="ft11">18</span></p>
      <p>Practical religion must be carried into the lowly duties of daily life. And in the performance of these duties
          you are forming characters that will stand the test of the judgment. Then, in whatever position you may be
          placed, whatever your duties may be, do them nobly and faithfully, realizing that all heaven is beholding your
          work.<span class="ft11">19</span></p>
