    <h1>To Which Party Do You Belong?</h1>

      <p><strong>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
          heaven. Matthew 10:32.</strong></p>
      <p>The truth, to be genuine in its inﬂuence on the human heart, must be acknowledged before the universe of
          heaven, before the worlds unfallen, and before men. Let no one entertain the idea that he may work out his own
          salvation or receive the smallest spiritual blessing which the gospel offers, by stealth. The Lord calls for
          open, manly confession. “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord” (Isaiah 43:10). Nothing can be effectually
          gained in advancing in the knowledge of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ until the unbelieving one, longing
          after Christian excellence of character, shall become as God has <nobr>intended—a</nobr> spectacle unto the
          world, to angels, and to men, a city set on a hill that cannot be hid....</p>
      <p>When one places his feet on the solid rock Christ Jesus as his foundation, he receives an endowment of power
          from the Source of all knowledge, all wisdom, and spiritual efﬁciency, that all may know to which party he
          <nobr>belongs—commandment</nobr> keepers or commandment breakers. The banner of Prince Emmanuel that ﬂoats
          over his head will not fail to clear away all uncertainty and give all to understand that we keep the
          commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. The love of Jesus Christ possesses a constraining
          power.<span class="ft22">43</span></p>
      <p>When Jesus was asked the question, Art thou the Son of God? He knew that to answer in the afﬁrmative would make
          His death certain; a denial would leave a stain upon His humanity. There was a time to be silent, and a time
          to speak. He had not spoken until plainly interrogated. In His lessons to His disciples He had declared:
          “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
          heaven.” When challenged, Jesus did not deny His relationship with God. In that solemn moment His character
          was at stake and must be vindicated. He left on that occasion an example for man to follow under similar
          circumstances. He would teach him not to apostatize from his faith to escape suffering or even death.<span
