    <h1>Fullness of the Godhead</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the
          sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that
          sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. Revelation 5:13.</strong></p>
      <p>On the isle of Patmos John saw the things which God desired him to give to the people. Here is a theme worthy
          of our contemplation. Here are large and comprehensive lessons, which all the angelic hosts are now seeking to
          communicate. Inﬁnite wisdom, inﬁnite love, inﬁnite justice, inﬁnite <nobr>mercy—depths,</nobr> heights,
          lengths, breadths! Numberless pens have been employed to represent the life and character and mediatorial work
          of Christ, and yet to every mind through whom the Holy Spirit works these themes are presented fresh and new,
          just in accordance with the mind and spirit of the human agent. The Lord Jesus promised that the Spirit He
          would send would recall His words to the minds of those prepared to receive them. After His resurrection He
          opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures. Up to that time the disciples had not
          comprehended them, for the rubbish of rabbinical lore had hidden the truth from their view.</p>
      <p>The truth, if received, is capable of constant expansion and new developments. It will increase in brightness
          as we behold it, and grow in height and depth as we aspire to grasp it. Thus it will elevate us to the
          standard of perfection, and give us faith and trust in God as our strength for the work before us. We need the
          truth as it is in Jesus.... As His representatives and witnesses we need to come to a full understanding of
          the saving truth which</p>
      <p>we must know by an experimental knowledge.</p>
      <p>“In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins” (Colossians 1:14). This is the
          great practical truth which must be stamped upon the soul. It is of the greatest importance that all should
          comprehend the greatness and power of the truth to those who receive it. “In him dwelleth all the fulness of
          the Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9).<span class="ft11">38</span></p>
