    <h1>The Rest Christ Offers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Matthew
          11:28.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a condition to the rest and peace here offered us by Christ. It is that of yoking up with Him. All who
          will accept the condition will ﬁnd that the yoke of Christ will help them to bear every burden needful for
          them to carry. Without Christ at our side to bear the heaviest part of the load, we must indeed say that it is
          heavy. But yoked with Him to our car of duty, the burdens of life may all be lightly carried. And just in
          proportion as man acts in willing obedience to the requirements of God will come rest of spirit....</p>
      <p>Meekness and humility will characterize all who are obedient to the law of God, all who will wear the yoke of
          Christ with submission. These graces will bring the desirable result of peace in the service of God....</p>
      <p>God knows that if we were left to follow our own inclinations, to go just where our will would lead us, we
          would fall into Satan’s lines and become possessors of his attributes. Therefore the law of God conﬁnes us to
          the will of One who is high and noble and elevating. He desires that we shall patiently and wisely take up the
          duties of service.... A sullen submission to the will of the Father will develop the character of a rebel. The
          service is</p>
      <p>looked upon by such a one in the light of drudgery. It is not rendered cheerfully and in the love of God. It is
          a mere mechanical performance.... Such service brings no peace or quietude to the soul.</p>
      <p>God presents to the world two classes. For the <nobr>one—the</nobr><nobr>wicked—He</nobr> says, “There is no
          peace” (Isaiah 48:22). Of the other, “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them”
          (Psalm 119:165)....</p>
      <p>The Lord calls His yoke easy and His burden light. Yet that yoke will not give us a life of ease and freedom
          and selﬁsh indulgence. The life of Christ was one of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr>
          at every step. And His true follower, with consistent, Christlike tenderness and love, will follow in the
          footsteps of his Master.<span class="ft17">35</span></p>
