    <h1>A Change of Raiment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the
          garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with
          ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. Isaiah 61:10.</strong></p>
      <p>“And he shewed me Joshua the high <nobr>priest”—a</nobr> representative of the people who keep the commandments
          of <nobr>God—“standing</nobr> before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist
          him” (Zechariah 3:1).</p>
      <p>Christ is our High Priest. Satan stands before Him night and day as an accuser of the brethren. With his
          masterly power he presents every objectionable feature of character as sufﬁcient reason for the withdrawal of
          Christ’s protecting power, thus allowing Satan to discourage and destroy those whom he has caused to sin. But
          Christ has made atonement for every sinner. Can we by faith hear our Advocate saying, “The Lord rebuke thee, O
          Satan; ... is not this a brand plucked out of the ﬁre?” (verse 2).</p>
      <p>“Now Joshua was clothed with ﬁlthy garments” (verse 3). Thus sinners appear before the enemy who by his
          masterly, deceptive power has led them away from allegiance to God. With garments of sin and shame the enemy
          clothes those who have been overpowered by his temptations, and then he declares that it is unfair for Christ
          to be their Light, their Defender.... Hear the words of Jesus: ... I will blot out his transgressions. I
          will</p>
      <p>cover his sins....</p>
      <p>The ﬁlthy garments are removed; for Christ says, “I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee” (verse 4).
          The iniquity is transferred to the innocent, the pure, the holy Son of God; and man, all undeserving, stands
          before the Lord cleansed from all unrighteousness, and clothed with the imputed righteousness of Christ. Oh,
          what a change of raiment is this!<span class="ft11">17</span></p>
      <p>He takes every sin away, and puts on us His robe of righteousness woven in the loom of heaven.... We are</p>
      <p>adopted into the heavenly family, and we shall inherit the mansions prepared for those who are obedient.<span
