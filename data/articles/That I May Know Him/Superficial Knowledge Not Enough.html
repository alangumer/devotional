    <h1>Superﬁcial Knowledge Not Enough</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which
          is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Colossians 1:27.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many mysteries in the Word of God that we do not comprehend, and many of us are content to stop our
          investigation when we have just begun to receive a little knowledge concerning Christ. When there begins to be
          a little unfolding of the divine purposes to the mind, and we begin to obtain a slight knowledge of the
          character of God, we become satisﬁed and think that we have received about all the light that there is for us
          in the Word of God. But the truth of God is inﬁnite. With painstaking effort we should work in the mines of
          truth, discovering the precious jewels that have been hidden.... Jesus meant just what He said when He
          directed</p>
      <p>His disciples to “search the Scriptures” (John 5:39). Searching means to compare scripture with scripture, and
          spiritual things with spiritual. We should not be satisﬁed with a superﬁcial knowledge.<span
          class="ft15">7</span></p>
      <p>We do not half realize what the Lord is willing to do for His people.... Our petitions, mingled with faith</p>
      <p>and contrition, should go up to God for an understanding of the mysteries that God would make known to His
          saints.... An angel’s pen could not portray all the glory of the revealed plan of redemption. The Bible tells
          how</p>
      <p>Christ bore our sins and carried our sorrows. Here is revealed how mercy and truth have met together at the
          cross of Calvary, how righteousness and peace have kissed each other, how the righteousness of Christ may be
          imparted to fallen man. There inﬁnite wisdom, inﬁnite justice, inﬁnite mercy, and inﬁnite love were displayed.
          Depths, heights, lengths, and breadths of love and wisdom, all passing knowledge, are made known in the plan
          of salvation.<span class="ft11">8</span></p>
      <p>He who desires the truth in his heart, who longs for the working of its powers upon the life and character,
          will be sure to have it. Says the Saviour, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
          for they shall be ﬁlled” (Matthew 5:6).<span class="ft11">9</span></p>
