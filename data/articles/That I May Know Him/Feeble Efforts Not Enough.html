    <h1>Feeble Efforts Not Enough</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my
          heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. Psalm 61:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>When we are burdened, when we are pressed with temptation, when the feelings and desires of the natural heart
          are contending for the victory, we should offer up fervent, importunate prayer to our heavenly Father in the
          name of Christ, and this will bring Jesus to our help, so that through His <nobr>all-powerful</nobr> and
          efﬁcacious name we may gain the victory and banish Satan from our side. But we should not ﬂatter ourselves
          that we are safe while we make but feeble efforts in our own behalf.... “Strive to enter in at the strait
          gate” (Luke 13:24).</p>
      <p>Our danger does not arise from the opposition of the world, but it is found in the liability of our being in
          friendship with the world and imitating the example of those who love not God or His truth. The loss of
          earthly things for the truth’s sake, the suffering of great inconvenience for loyalty to principle, does not
          place us in danger of losing our faith and hope; but we are in danger of suffering loss because of being
          deceived and overcome by the temptations of Satan. Trials will work for our good if we receive and bear them
          without murmuring, and will tend to separate us from the love of the world and will lead us to trust more
          fully in God.</p>
      <p>There is help for us only in God. We should not ﬂatter ourselves that we have any strength in wisdom of our
          own, for our strength is weakness, our judgment foolishness. Christ conquered the foe in our behalf because He
          pitied our weakness and knew that we would be overcome and would perish if He did not come to our help. He
          clothed His divinity with humanity, and thus was qualiﬁed to reach man with His human arm while with His
          divine arm He grasped the throne of the Inﬁnite. The merits of Christ elevate and ennoble humanity, and
          through the name and grace of Christ it is possible for man to overcome the degradation caused by the Fall,
          and through the exalted, divine nature of Christ to be linked to the Inﬁnite.<span class="ft17">23</span></p>
