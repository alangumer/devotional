    <h1>Standing Firm in Days of Peril</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 1 Peter
          4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The signs of the times tell us that the end of all things is at hand. Prophecies fulﬁlled have become facts of
          history, clearly deﬁning our position. We are standing upon the verge of the eternal world.... Our Lord</p>
      <p>forewarned His people that iniquity would abound in the last days and would have a paralyzing inﬂuence upon
          true godliness. Wickedness is seen and heard and felt all around us. It seems to permeate the very atmosphere,
          and affects the faith and love of God’s professed people. It is difﬁcult to hold fast Christian integrity. The
          fact is, much which is current in our day as Christianity is indebted for its very existence to the absence of
          persecution. When the test of ﬁery trial comes, a great proportion of these who profess the faith will show
          that their religion was hollow formalism....</p>
      <p>The days in which we live are days of peril. Carelessness, levity, love of pleasure and selﬁsh gratiﬁcation,
          are seen in the lives of very many professed Christians. Is this the time for <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr>
          Adventists to lose their faith and grow cold and formal? God forbid! Shall we turn traitor at the very moment
          when God would be most gloriﬁed by our steadfast adherence to principle? Shall we turn from the heavenly
          attractions now, when we can almost see the glories on the other shore? We are living in the most important
          period of earth’s history. By maintaining our allegiance to God, we may bear the noblest testimony for Christ
          and the truth.</p>
      <p>The true Christian will cling to the promises of God more ﬁrmly now than ever before. His heart is where he has
          laid up his <nobr>treasure—in</nobr> heaven. When right principles are despised and forsaken, then the true
          and loyal will show their warmest zeal and deepest love; then they will stand most ﬁrmly for truth, unpopular
          though it be....</p>
      <p>The Lord is coming.... Let us be consistent; let our works correspond with our profession of faith.<span
