    <h1>Christ in the Home</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: and both
          Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. John 2:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>On the occasion of the marriage feast He desired to express His sympathy with, and approval of, those at the
          wedding. Christ did not come to this world to forbid marriage or to break down or destroy the relationship and
          inﬂuence which exist in the domestic circle. He came to restore, elevate, purify, and ennoble every current of
          pure affection, that the family on earth might become a symbol of the family in heaven....</p>
      <p>Mothers are under the tender care of heavenly angels. How interestedly the Lord Jesus knocks at the door of
          families where there are little children to be educated and trained! How gently he watches over the mothers’
          interest, and how sad He feels to see children neglected.... In the home characters are formed; human
          beings</p>
      <p>are molded and fashioned to be either a blessing or a curse. To the mother the Lord has committed the younger
          members of the family as they come into our world weak and helpless. Inﬁnite wisdom and inﬁnite love does not
          commit this gentle ofﬁce, so pregnant with eternal results, to the fathers, full of business plans and cares.
          Woman’s heart is full of patience and love if that woman has surrendered her heart to God. She must cooperate
          with God and her husband in training the precious souls entrusted to her, to grow up into Christ Jesus. And
          the father, relying upon the grace of God, should bear the sacred responsibility that rests upon him as the
          husband, which means <nobr>house-band.</nobr></p>
      <p>In babyhood and childhood, when the nature is pliable, God would have the ﬁrmest impressions made for right. A
          battle is constantly going on between the Prince of life and the prince of this world. The question to be
          settled is, Whom will the mother choose as her <nobr>co-worker</nobr> to mold and fashion the characters of
          her children? If she will learn that love is the key to the souls of her children, Christ will preside in the
          home, ﬁlling it with heavenly sunshine. This is His work in every home that will admit Him.<span
