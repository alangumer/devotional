    <h1>Redeemed by Christ’s Blood</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your
          vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
          without blemish and without spot. 1 Peter 1:18, 19.</strong></p>
      <p>“‘Ye are not your own.... Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your
          spirit,</p>
      <p>which are God’s” (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20). Will you give back to God that which He has ransomed with the price
          of His own blood? Will you give Him your reasoning powers; will you set them apart for His glory? They are
          His; He has bought them with a price. Will you place yourselves in the school of Christ, that your conscience
          may be enlightened, that it may be a good conscience, a faithful sentinel to guard the highest interests of
          the soul? Christ has purchased the affections; will you triﬂe with them, will you pervert them? Will you place
          them upon unworthy objects, center them upon human beings and make the creature instead of the Creator your
          God to worship? Or shall your affections be puriﬁed, ennobled, reﬁned, and made to twine about your Creator
          and Redeemer? ...</p>
      <p>God will not occupy a divided heart or reign from a divided throne. Every rival that holds the affections and
          diverts them from the God of love must be dethroned. The Lord demands all that there is of us, and there must
          be no reserve. Christ has purchased us, we are His heritage, and we are to be honored by being
          <nobr>co-laborers</nobr> with Jesus Christ. Wear the yoke with Christ, and daily walk with God. How shall we
          do this? By laying hold upon the help which God has provided. The Lord has said, “Ask, and it shall be given
          you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (Matthew 7:7).<span

      <p>God has bought us, and He claims a throne in each heart. Our minds and bodies must be subordinated to Him, and
          the natural habits and appetites must be made subservient to the higher wants of the soul. But we can place no
          dependence upon ourselves in this work. We cannot with safety follow our own guidance. The Holy Spirit must
          renew and sanctify us. In God’s service there must be no halfway work.<span class="ft17">34</span></p>
