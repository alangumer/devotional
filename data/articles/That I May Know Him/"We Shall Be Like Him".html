    <h1>“We Shall Be Like Him”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
          when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus, the world’s Redeemer, knows all His children by name, and on those who believe shall come the glory of
          God.... Those who behold Jesus become changed to His image, become assimilated to His nature, and</p>
      <p>the glory of God that shines in the face of Jesus, is reﬂected in the lives of His followers. More and more the
          Christian is changed from glory to glory.... The more he looks on Christ, the more he loves and longs to
          look</p>
      <p>again, and the more light and love and glory he sees in Christ, the more his light increases....</p>
      <p>It is by faith that the spiritual eye beholds the glory of Jesus. This glory is hidden until the Lord imparts
          the light of spiritual truth, for the eye of reason cannot see it. The glory and mystery of Christ remains
          incomprehensible, clouded by its excessive brightness, until the Lord ﬂashes its meaning before the
          soul....</p>
      <p>By faith the soul catches divine light from Jesus. We see matchless charms in His purity and humility, His
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> His wonderful sacriﬁce to save fallen man. Contemplation of Christ leads man to
          place a proper estimate upon himself.... The possibility of being like Jesus, whom he loves and adores,
          inspires within him that</p>
      <p>faith which works by love and puriﬁes the heart....</p>
      <p>Jesus is more precious to the soul that beholds Him by the eye of faith than is anything else beside, and the
          believing soul is more precious to Jesus than ﬁne gold of Ophir. Christ looks upon His <nobr>hands—the</nobr>
          marks of the cruciﬁxion are <nobr>there—and</nobr> He says, “I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands;
          thy walls are continually before me” (Isaiah 49:16). The Christian is walled in by the rich full promises of
          an inﬁnite God.</p>
      <p>The Lord is coming with power and great glory. All who have made Christ their refuge will reﬂect His image, and
          they will be like Him, for they shall see Him as He is. They are to be presented to Him without “spot, or
          wrinkle, or any such thing” (Ephesians 5:27).<span class="ft11">31</span></p>
