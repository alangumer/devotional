    <h1>Our Perfect Pattern</h1>

      <p><strong>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ,
          the Son of the living God. Matthew 16:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>To human eyes Christ was only a man, yet He was a perfect man. In His humanity He was the impersonation of the
          divine character. God embodied His own attributes in His <nobr>Son—His</nobr> power, His wisdom, His goodness,
          His purity, His truthfulness, His spirituality, and His benevolence. In Him, though human, all perfection of
          character, all divine excellence, dwelt. And to the request of His disciple, “Shew us the Father, and it
          sufﬁceth us,” He could reply, “Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he
          that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?” “I and my Father are
          one” (John 14:8, 9; 10:30)....</p>
      <p>The strong denunciation of the Pharisees against Jesus was, “Thou, being a man, makest thyself God” (John
          10:33), and for this reason they sought to stone Him. Christ did not apologize for this supposed assumption on
          His part. He did not say to His accusers, “You misunderstand me; I am not God.” He was manifesting God in
          humanity. Yet He was the humblest of all the prophets, and He exempliﬁed in His life the truth that the more
          perfect the character of human beings, the more simple and humble they will be. He has given to men a pattern
          of what they may be in their humanity, through becoming partakers of the divine nature....</p>
      <p>The centuries that have passed since Christ was among men have not lessened the conﬁdence of our testimony that
          Christ is all that He claimed to be. Today the question may be repeated, “What think ye of Christ?” (Matthew
          22:42), and without a moment’s hesitation the answer may be given, “He is the light of the world, the greatest
          religious thinker and teacher the world has ever known.” All who hear His voice today, all who study the
          principles set forth in His teaching, must say, in truthfulness, as did the Jews of His day, “Never man spake
          like this man.” “Is not this the Christ?” (John 7:46; 4:29).<span class="ft11">22</span></p>
