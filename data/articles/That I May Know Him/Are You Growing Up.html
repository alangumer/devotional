    <h1>Are You Growing Up?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.
          Ephesians 4:15.</strong></p>
      <p>It is no real evidence that you are a Christian because your emotion is stirred, your spirit stirred by truth.
          The question is, Are you growing up into Christ, your living head? Is the grace of Christ manifested in your
          life? God gives His grace to men, that they may desire more of His grace. God’s grace is ever working upon the
          human heart, and when it is received, the evidence of its reception will appear in the life and character of
          its recipient, for spiritual life will be seen developing from within. The grace of Christ in the heart will
          always promote spiritual life, and spiritual advancement will be made. We each need a personal Saviour or we
          shall perish in our sins. Let the question be asked of our souls, Are we growing up unto Christ, our living
          head? Am I gaining advanced knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ whom He hath sent? We do not see the plants
          grow in the ﬁeld, and yet we are assured that they do grow, and may we not know of our own spiritual strength
          and growth?<span class="ft11">7</span></p>
      <p>When we are truly Christ’s, our hearts will be full of meekness, gentleness, and kindness, because Jesus has
          forgiven our sins. As obedient children we shall receive and cherish the precepts He has given, and shall
          attend to the ordinances He has instituted. We shall be seeking constantly to obtain a knowledge of Him. His
          example will be our rule of life. Those who are Christ’s disciples will take the work where He left it and
          carry it forward in His name. They will copy the words, the spirit, the practices, of none but Him. Their eye
          is upon the Captain of their salvation. His will is their law. And as they advance, they catch more and
          clearer views of His countenance, of His character, of His glory. They do not cling to self, but hold fast His
          Word.... They reduce their knowledge</p>
      <p>of His will to practice. They hear and do the things that Jesus teaches.... Such are entitled to all the
          promises of</p>
      <p>His Word. Becoming one with Christ, they do the will of God, and exhibit the riches of His grace.<span
