    <h1>Profession Not Enough</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
          the will of my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 7:21.</strong></p>
      <p>A profession of religion is of no value unless good works testify to the sincerity and reality of its
          claim....</p>
      <p>Those who make great professions and do not bear the fruits of godliness make it manifest that they are not
          abiding in the True Vine, for “by their fruits ye shall know them.” They are dead branches....</p>
      <p>Conversion has become a matter of perplexity to many because of the confusing doctrines that are taught in
          regard to what is religion. Coming to Christ means something more than belonging to the church. There are many
          whose names are registered on the leaves of the church record but whose names are not written in the Lamb’s
          book of life. Coming to Christ does not require a severe mental effort and agony. It is simply accepting the
          terms of salvation that God has made plain in His Word.<span class="ft11">24</span></p>
      <p>God desires the willing service of our hearts. He has endowed us with reasoning faculties, with talents of
          ability, and with means and inﬂuence, to be exercised for the good of mankind, that we may manifest His spirit
          before the world. Precious opportunities and privileges are placed within our reach, and if we neglect them we
          rob others, we defraud our own souls, and dishonor our Maker. We shall not want to meet these slighted
          opportunities and neglected privileges in the day of judgment. Our eternal interests for the future depend on
          the present diligent performance of duty in improving the talents that God has given into our trust for the
          salvation of souls....</p>
      <p>True religion works out the principles of God’s <nobr>law—love</nobr> to God and love to man. Those who will be
          accepted of Heaven will have put their talents out to the exchangers for the glory of God and the good of
          humanity. They will have become laborers together with God, and will receive the approval of the Master when
          He comes in the clouds of heaven. Religion is something more than a profession, something deeper than an
          impulsive feeling. It is doing the will of God.<span class="ft11">25</span></p>
