    <h1>Dare to Be Different!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
          perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. Philippians 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Let every one, for Christ’s sake and for his own soul’s sake, shun conformity to the world, to its customs,
          vanities, and fashions. Beware of human commandments that will obscure the holy commandments of God. The
          pleasure lover is ever unsatisﬁed, and continually desires to seek again the excitement of the ballroom, the
          theater, or the party of pleasure. The time God has granted us in which to prepare for eternity is spent by
          thousands in poring over ﬁctitious stories. <nobr>God-given</nobr> intellect is perverted, the Word of God is
          neglected, the mind and soul are robbed of moral power needed for wrestling against faults and errors, habits
          and practices, that disqualify the soul for the enjoyment of Christ’s presence....</p>
      <p>Let the question be asked seriously and with intense interest, “How is it with my soul? Am I by my habits and
          practices working against my Redeemer?” Inquire, “Do I bring glory to Christ? Do I show to a disobedient and
          crooked generation that I choose to suffer reproach for the sake of Jesus?” ... Will the professed followers
          of Christ aim high, and reach the standard of holiness? Better be a worldling than a common, cheap, professed
          Christian. Dare to come out from the world and be separate. Dare to be singular because you love Jesus better
          than the world, and righteousness with persecution better than disobedience with worldly prosperity. Holy and
          entire obedience through dependence upon the Lord Jesus Christ will strengthen the soul to be steadfast in the
          faith and hope of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Jesus says, “Without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5). Union with Christ is our only means for overcoming sin.
          Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment from Christ, we bear fruit
          after the similitude of Christ. We live and move in Him; we are one with Him and one with the Father. The name
          of Christ is gloriﬁed in the believing child of God. This is Bible religion.<span class="ft11">10</span></p>
