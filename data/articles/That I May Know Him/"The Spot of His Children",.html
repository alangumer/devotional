    <h1>“The Spot of His Children”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the Lord. Psalm
          144:15.</strong></p>
      <p>I will thank the Lord my God for His great goodness and mercy and love expressed to the human family. I am
          impressed we should cultivate cheerfulness; and what does this do? It reveals to the world the peace and
          comfort that it is our privilege to claim. It is not honoring our Lord and Saviour to carry a shade of gloom.
          Many do this....</p>
      <p>“Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. My doctrine shall drop as
          the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon
          the grass; because I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. He is the Rock, his
          work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.
          They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children” (Deuteronomy
          <nobr>32:1-5).</nobr></p>
      <p>“Not the spot of his children.” They do not possess the character of the sons and daughters of God; do not in
          spirit, in words, in actions, appear as the people who love God and keep His commandments. “Do ye thus requite
          the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
          established thee?” “For the Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. He found him in
          a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the
          apple of his eye” (verses 6, 9, 10).</p>
      <p>The tenderness of God to His people, His unceasing care for them, the riches of the wisdom of the methods He
          has taken to lead them to Himself, demand our gratitude offerings expressed in most earnest devotion to serve
          Him with all humility of mind and contrition of soul. The Lord is gracious, and He would have His people
          represent His <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> by acknowledgment in cheerful thanksgiving to God. All who
          appreciate the favors of God will be a happy people.<span class="ft11">1</span></p>
