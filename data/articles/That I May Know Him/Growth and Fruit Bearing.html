    <h1>Growth and Fruit Bearing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; that ye may approve
          things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. Philippians 1:9,
          10.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the Lord’s desire that His followers shall grow in grace, that their love shall abound more and more,
          that they shall be ﬁlled with the fruits of righteousness.... Where there is life, there will be growth and
          fruit bearing;</p>
      <p>but unless we grow in grace, our spirituality will be dwarfed, sickly, fruitless. It is only by growing, by
          bearing fruit, that we can fulﬁll God’s purpose for us. “Herein is my Father gloriﬁed,” Christ said, “that ye
          bear much fruit” (John 15:8). in order to bear much fruit, we must make the most of our privileges. We must
          use every opportunity granted us for obtaining strength.</p>
      <p>A pure, noble character, with all its grand possibilities, has been provided for every human being. But there
          are many who have not an earnest longing for such a character. They are not willing to part with the evil that
          they may have the good. Great opportunities are placed within their reach. But they neglect to grasp the
          blessings that would place them in harmony with God. They work at <nobr>cross-purposes</nobr> with the One who
          is seeking their good. They are dead branches, having no living union with the Vine. They cannot grow.</p>
      <p>One of the divine plans for growth is impartation. The Christian is to gain strength by strengthening others.
          “He that watereth shall be watered also himself” (Proverbs 11:25). This is not merely a promise; it is a
          divine law, a law by which God designs that the streams of benevolence, like the waters of the great deep,
          shall be kept in constant circulation, continually ﬂowing back to their source....</p>
      <p>Christians, is Christ revealed in us? Are we doing all in our power to gain a body that is not easily
          enfeebled, a mind that looks beyond self to the cause and effect of every movement, that can wrestle with hard
          problems and conquer them, a will that is ﬁrm to resist evil and defend the right? Are we crucifying self? Are
          we growing up unto the full stature of men and women in Christ?<span class="ft11">9</span></p>
