    <h1>Limitless Heights to Reach</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be
          brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:13.</strong></p>
      <p>“Gird up the loins of your mind,” says the apostle; then control your thoughts, not allowing them to have full
          scope. The thoughts may be guarded and controlled by your own determined efforts. Think right thoughts and you
          will perform right actions. You have, then, to guard the affections, not letting them go out and fasten upon
          improper objects. Jesus has purchased you with His own life; you belong to Him, therefore He is to be
          consulted in all things as to how the powers of your mind and the affections of your heart shall be
          employed....</p>
      <p>Every wrong tendency may be, through the grace of Christ, repressed, not in a languid, irresolute manner, but
          with ﬁrmness of purpose, with high resolves to make Christ the pattern. Let your love go out for those things
          that Jesus loved, and be withheld from those things that will give no strength to right impulses. With
          determined energy seek to learn, and to improve the character every day. You must have ﬁrmness of purpose to
          take yourself in hand and be what you know God would be pleased to have you.<span class="ft17">10</span></p>
      <p>Thoughts of God and of heaven are ennobling. There is no limit to the height you may reach, for it will be like
          swimming in waters where there is no bottom.... There is nothing belittling in the pure religion of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>The gospel received will bow down the loftiness of human understanding and lay the haughtiness of man low, that
          God alone may be exalted. But in this it does not dwarf the intellect and cripple the energies.... True
          religion</p>
      <p>unfolds and calls out the mental energies. Conviction and repentance of sin, renunciation of self, and trust in
          the merits of the blood of Christ cannot be experienced without the individual being made more thoughtful,
          more intellectual, than he was before. No one will become mentally imbecile by having his attention directed
          to God. Connection with God is connection with all true wisdom.<span class="ft15">11</span></p>
