    <h1>Addressed to Me Personally</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me; thou art my help and my deliverer; make no
          tarrying, O my God. Psalm 40:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Do not let your great need discourage you. The Saviour of sinners, the Friend of the friendless, with
          compassion inﬁnitely greater than that of a tender mother for a loved and afﬂicted child, is inviting, “Look
          unto me, and be ye saved” (Isaiah 45:22). “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
          iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed” (Isaiah
          53:5)....</p>
      <p>There is danger of not making Christ’s teachings a personal matter, of not receiving them as though they were
          addressed to us personally. In His words of instruction Jesus means me. I may appropriate to myself His
          merits, His death, His cleansing blood, as fully as though there were not another sinner in the world for whom
          Christ died....</p>
      <p>There are toils and conﬂicts and <nobr>self-denials</nobr> for us all. Not one will escape them. We must tread
          the path where Jesus leads the way. It may be in tears, in trials, in bereavements, in sorrow for sins, or in
          seeking for the mastery over depraved desires, unbalanced characters, and unholy tempers. It requires earnest
          effort to present ourselves a living sacriﬁce, holy and acceptable to God. It takes the entire being. There is
          no chamber of the mind where Satan can hold sway and carry out his devices. Self must be cruciﬁed.
          Consecration, submission, and sacriﬁces must be made that will seem like taking the very lifeblood from the
          heart.<span class="ft17">1</span></p>
      <p>Will it make you sad to be buffeted, despised, derided, maligned of the world? It ought not, for Jesus told us
          just how it would be. “If the world hate you,” He says, “ye know that it hated me before it hated you” (John
          15:18). The apostle Paul, the great hero of faith, testiﬁes: “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present
          time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” (Romans 8:18). “For our
          light afﬂiction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory”
          (2 Corinthians 4:17).<span class="ft11">2</span></p>
