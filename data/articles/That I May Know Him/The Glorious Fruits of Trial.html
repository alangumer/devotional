    <h1>The Glorious Fruits of Trial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried
          with ﬁre, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter
          1:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Let us believe in Jesus, trusting Him implicitly, although we may be tried as by ﬁre.... We may love
          Christ</p>
      <p>more and increase our capacity for loving Him by contemplating and talking of His love. Cultivate the habit of
          talking with the Saviour when alone, when walking and working. Let gratitude and thanksgiving ascend to God
          because Jesus loves you and you love Jesus....</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus gave Himself a sacriﬁce for us. He knows us and He knows just what we need. Trial lasts only for
          a season. Encourage your heart in faith. We must not look on trial as punishment. Christ is the sin bearer. He
          is our Redeemer, and He desires to purify us from all dross. He means to make us partakers of the divine
          nature, developing in us the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The very fact that we are called upon to
          endure trials proves that the Lord Jesus sees in us something very precious that He would have developed. If
          He saw nothing in us whereby we might glorify His name He would not spend time reﬁning us. We do not take
          special pains to prune brambles. Christ does not cast valueless stones into His furnace. It is precious ore
          that He tests. He sees that the reﬁning process will bring out the reﬂection of His own image. Be trustful, be
          hopeful, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. He loves you. Hear His words: “As many as I
          love, I rebuke and chasten” (Revelation 3:19). He has not passed you by as unworthy of a trial.</p>
      <p>What is the result of this reﬁning process? That ye may “be found unto praise and honour and glory at the
          appearing of Jesus Christ.” O how precious to the soul is one word of commendation that comes from the
          Redeemer’s lips! We may not understand all now, but the day is coming when we shall be more than satisﬁed,
          when we shall see as we are seen, and realize that trial has wrought out for us a far more exceeding and
          eternal weight of glory.<span class="ft11">37</span></p>
