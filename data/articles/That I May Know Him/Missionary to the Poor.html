    <h1>Missionary to the Poor</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he
          hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the
          blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised. Luke 4:18.</strong></p>
      <p>The sufferings of humanity ever touched the heart and called forth the sympathy and love of Christ. He
          exercised pity and compassion toward those who were afﬂicted in soul or body. His example in the matter of
          treating the suffering and afﬂicted should teach us how to have compassion and pity for the sufferings of His
          creatures.</p>
      <p>Christ suffered in the ﬂesh.... He knew what it was to suffer keen pangs of hunger, and He has given
          special</p>
      <p>lessons in regard to feeding the hungry and caring for the needy poor, and has declared that in ministering to
          the needy we are ministering to Himself in the person of His saints. He says, “I was an hungred, and ye gave
          me meat” (Matthew 25:35). He knew the discomfort and suffering of thirst, and He declared that a cup of cold
          water given in His name to any of His disciples should not lose its reward.<span class="ft11">9</span></p>
      <p>Christ was an active, constant worker. He found the domain of religion fenced in by high, steep walls of
          seclusion as too sacred a matter for everyday life. He threw down the walls of partition, and exercised His
          helping power in behalf of every one who needed Him. He brought cheerfulness and hope to the
          desponding....</p>
      <p>He did not ask, What is your creed? To what church do you belong? Active, earnest, loving interest marked His
          life....</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus knows what poverty means. He is the great missionary to the poor, the sick, the suffering. The
          King of heaven, He could have led a life of wealth and have lived among the wealthiest; but He chose poverty.
          And He has honored the poor who believe in Him, for He blessed them forever. Poverty with Christ is riches of
          the highest value. This poverty is sanctiﬁed and blessed....</p>
      <p>In the humanity of Christ there are golden threads that bind the believing, trusting poor man to His own soul
          of inﬁnite love.<span class="ft15">10</span></p>
