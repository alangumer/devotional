    <h1>Where Wisdom Begins</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
          Proverbs 9:10.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a wide difference between what God has given men capacity to become, and the degree of excellence to
          which they actually attain.<span class="ft15">4</span></p>
      <p>The Word of God presents the most potent means of education, as well as the most valuable source of knowledge,
          within the reach of man. The understanding adapts itself to the dimensions of the subjects with which it is
          required to deal. If occupied with trivial, commonplace matters only, never summoned to earnest effort to
          comprehend great and eternal truths, it becomes dwarfed and enfeebled. Hence the value of the Scriptures, as a
          means of intellectual culture.... They lead directly to the contemplation of the most exalted, the most
          ennobling,</p>
      <p>and the most stupendous truths that are presented to the mind of man. They direct our thoughts to the inﬁnite
          Author of all things. We see revealed the character of the Eternal, and listen to His voice as He communes
          with patriarchs and prophets. We see explained the mysteries of His providence, the great problems which have
          engaged the attention of every thoughtful mind, but which, without the aid of revelation, human intellect
          seeks in vain to solve. They open to our understanding a simple yet sublime system of theology, presenting
          truths which a child may grasp, but which are yet so far reaching as to bafﬂe the powers of the strongest
          mind.</p>
      <p>The more closely God’s Word is searched, and the better understood, the more vividly will the student realize
          that there is, beyond, inﬁnite wisdom, knowledge, and power....</p>
      <p>If the youth will but learn of the heavenly Teacher, as did Daniel, they will know that the fear of the Lord is
          the beginning of wisdom.... Those who consecrate themselves to God, and who have the protection of His
          grace</p>
      <p>and the quickening inﬂuence of His Spirit, will manifest keener intellectual power than the mere worldling.
          They will be able to reach the highest, noblest exercise of every faculty.<span class="ft15">5</span></p>
