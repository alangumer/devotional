    <h1>An Example of the Believers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
          ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. Titus
          2:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a great work for us to do if we would inherit eternal life. We are to deny ungodliness and worldly
          lusts, and live a life of righteousness.... There is no salvation for us except in Jesus, for it is through
          faith in</p>
      <p>Him that we receive power to become the sons of God. But it is not merely a passing faith, it is faith that
          works the works of Christ.... Living faith makes itself manifest by exhibiting a spirit of sacriﬁce and
          devotion toward</p>
      <p>the cause of God. Those who possess it stand under the banner of Prince Emmanuel and wage a successful warfare
          against the powers of darkness. They stand ready to do whatsoever their Captain commands. Each one is exhorted
          to be “an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity” (1
          Timothy 4:12), for we are to “live soberly, righteously, and godly” in this present evil world, representing
          the character of Christ, and manifesting His spirit....</p>
      <p>Those who are connected with Jesus are in union with the Maker and Upholder of all things. They have a power
          that the world cannot give nor take away. But while great and exalted privileges are given to them, they are
          not simply to rejoice in their blessings. As stewards of the manifold grace of God they are to become a
          blessing to others. They are entrusted with great truth, and “unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be
          much required” (Luke 12:48). There are weighty responsibilities resting upon all who have received the message
          for this time. They are to exert an inﬂuence that will draw others to the light of God’s Word.... We are our
          brother’s</p>
      <p>keeper....</p>
      <p>If we are true believers in Jesus we shall be gathering rays from glory, and we shall shed light on the
          darkened pathway of those around us. We shall reveal the gracious character of our Redeemer, and many will be
          drawn by our inﬂuence to “behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1:29).<span
