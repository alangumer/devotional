    <h1>A Never-failing Refuge</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
          requests be made known unto God. Philippians 4:6.</strong></p>
      <p>It is not the will of God that His people should be weighed down with care. But our Lord does not deceive us.
          He does not say to us, “Do not fear; there are no dangers in your path.” He knows there are trials and
          dangers, and He deals with us plainly. He does not propose to take His people out of a world of sin and evil,
          but He points them to a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> refuge....</p>
      <p>How can we remain in doubt, questioning whether Jesus loves us, sinful though we be and compassed with
          inﬁrmities? He gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto Himself a
          peculiar people, zealous of good works. He came to our world in the humble guise of a man, that He might
          become acquainted with the griefs and temptations that beset man’s pathway, and that He might know how to help
          the weary with His offer of rest and peace. But thousands upon thousands refuse His assistance and only cling
          more ﬁrmly to their burden of care. He comes to the afﬂicted, and offers to soothe their grief and heal their
          sorrow....</p>
      <p>To the disappointed, the unbelieving, and the unhappy He offers contentment, while pointing to mansions that He
          is preparing for them.... Jesus, our precious Saviour, should be ﬁrst in our thoughts and affections, and
          we</p>
      <p>should trust Him with entire conﬁdence....</p>
      <p>As each day comes we must in the strength of Jesus meet its trials and temptations. If we fail one day we add
          to the burdens of the next, and have less strength. We should not cloud the future by our carelessness in the
          present, but by thoughtful and careful performance of today’s duties be preparing to meet the emergencies of
          tomorrow.</p>
      <p>We need to cultivate a spirit of cheerfulness.... Let us ever look on the bright side of life and be hopeful,
          full</p>
      <p>of love and good works, rejoicing in the Lord always. “Let the peace of God rule in your hearts,” and “be ye
          thankful” (Colossians 3:15).<span class="ft15">10</span></p>
