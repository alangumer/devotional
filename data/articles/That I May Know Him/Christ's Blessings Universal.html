    <h1>Christ’s Blessings Universal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. John 1:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The grace of Christ is not conﬁned to a few. The message of mercy and forgiveness brought from heaven by Christ
          was to be heard by all. Our Saviour says, “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12). His blessings are
          universal, reaching to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples. Christ came to break down every wall of
          partition ... that every soul, whether Jew or Gentile, might be a free worshiper and have access to
          God....</p>
      <p>Through varied channels the heavenly messengers are in active communication with every part of the world, and
          when man calls upon the Lord with a true and earnest heart, God is represented as bending from His throne
          above. He listens to every yearning cry, and answers, “Here am I.” He raises up the distressed and oppressed.
          He bestows His blessings on the evil as well as on the good.</p>
      <p>In every precept that Christ taught, He was expounding His own life. God’s holy law was magniﬁed in this living
          representative. He was the revealer of the inﬁnite mind. He uttered no uncertain sentiments or opinions, but
          pure and holy truth.... He invites men to take a close view of God in Himself, in the inﬁnite love
          therein</p>
      <p>expressed.<span class="ft15">2</span></p>
      <p>To know God is the most wonderful knowledge that men can have. There is much wisdom with worldly men, but with
          all their wisdom they behold not the beauty and majesty, the justice and wisdom, the goodness and holiness, of
          the Creator of all worlds. The Lord walks among men by His providences, but His stately steppings are not
          heard, His presence is not discerned, His hand is not recognized. The work of Christ’s disciples is to shine
          as lights, making manifest to the world the character of God. They are to catch the increasing rays of light
          from the Word of God and reﬂect them to men enshrouded in the darkness of misapprehension of God. The servants
          of Christ must rightly represent the character of God and Christ to men.<span class="ft22">3</span></p>
