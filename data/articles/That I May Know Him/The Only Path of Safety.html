    <h1>The Only Path of Safety</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to
          the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. Isaiah 30:21.</strong></p>
      <p>I know that human beings suffer much because they step out of the path that God has chosen for them to follow.
          They walk in the sparks of the ﬁre they have kindled themselves, and the sure result is afﬂiction, unrest, and
          sorrow, which they might have avoided if they had submitted their will to God and had permitted Him to control
          their ways. God sees that it is necessary to oppose our will and our way, and bring our human will into
          subjection.</p>
      <p>Whatever path God chooses for us, whatever way He ordains for our feet, that is the only path of safety. We are
          daily to cherish a spirit of childlike submission, and pray that our eyes may be anointed with the heavenly
          eyesalve in order that we may discern the indications of the divine will, lest we become confused in our
          ideas, because our will seems to be <nobr>all-controlling.</nobr> With the eye of faith, with childlike
          submission as obedient children, we must look to God, to follow His guidance, and difﬁculties will clear away.
          The promise is, “I will instruct thee and teach thee ... : I will guide thee with mine eye” (Psalm
          32:8)....</p>
      <p>If we come to God in a humble and teachable spirit, not with our plans all formed before we ask Him, and shaped
          according to our own will, but in submission, in willingness to be taught, in faith, it is our privilege to
          claim the promise every hour of the day. We may distrust ourselves, and we need to guard against our own
          inclinations and strong tendencies lest we shall follow our mind and plans and think it is the way of the
          Lord....</p>
      <p>Our heavenly Father is our Ruler, and we must submit to His discipline. We are members of His family. He has a
          right to our service, and if one of the members of His family would persist in having his own way, persist in
          doing just that which he pleased, that spirit would bring about a disordered and perplexing state of things.
          We must not study to have our own way, but God’s way and God’s will.<span class="ft11">46</span></p>
