    <h1>To God Be the Glory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his
          might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
          understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness,
          in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord. Jeremiah 9:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>This is the most precious reproof and encouragement, the most important lesson for every soul that is trying to
          serve God. Here is expressed in plain words that in which the Lord delights. All who understand and know God
          will know Him as One that exercises <nobr>loving-kindness,</nobr> judgment, and righteousness. If they walk
          humbly with God they will be enabled to keep the way of the Lord, to do His will in all kindness, compassion,
          mercy, tenderness, and love, for God has said, “In these things I delight.” Then how careful should we be in
          regard to the fruit of the lips, that we dishonor not God by dealing unkindly with the purchase of His blood.
          If we express the character of God, we shall be Christian gentlemen and gentlewomen....</p>
      <p>Our prosperity as a people depends wholly upon our dependence upon God for our sufﬁciency, grace, and
          perfection of character in and through our Saviour, who has paid the ransom for us with His own glorious
          merits.<span class="ft11">43</span></p>
      <p>Those who know Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour have the privilege of being educated and trained in a
          higher school than that of men, and of being tutored under higher wisdom than that of ﬁnite beings. They may
          come under the tutorship of the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, and partake of the same knowledge that
          He gave to Daniel. Those who are humble in heart, those who feel their need of higher wisdom and do not rely
          upon their own ﬁnite judgment, but search earnestly to know the will of God, may draw from the Source of all
          knowledge, and obtain grace, prudence, discretion, and judgment. They will realize the fulﬁllment of the
          assurance of God’s Word: “The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple”
          (Psalm 119:130).<span class="ft11">44</span></p>
