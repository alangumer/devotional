    <h1>Fulﬁlling Life’s Obligations</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. Romans 14:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Ask yourselves the question, “What is my life toward God and toward my fellow men?” There is no one that liveth
          to himself. No life is lived on neutral ground. Our conceptions of life may be inﬂuenced by the enemy of all
          righteousness so that we do not realize its vast importance, but ... we cannot cast off our responsibility and
          live without reference to the future, immortal life, and still do our duty to God and to our fellow men. Each
          one is a part of the great web of humanity, and each one has a <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> inﬂuence. We cannot
          fulﬁll the obligations that rest upon us in our own strength alone. We must have divine aid in meeting our
          responsibilities, that our inﬂuence may ... gather with Christ.</p>
      <p>All our talents of time, ability, and inﬂuence were bestowed by God, and are to be given back to Him in willing
          service. The great object of the life which God has given is not the securing of temporal advantages, but the
          securing of eternal privileges in the kingdom of heaven. The Lord has bought all that there is of us by the
          precious blood of Christ, and it is the worst kind of robbery that could be practiced to withhold from Him His
          own.<span class="ft11">32</span></p>
      <p>Our life is not our own, never was, and never can be. The question of importance to us is, Is our life
          interwoven with that of Jesus? ... We shall come into judgment for the very atmosphere that surrounds the
          soul, for it is vital and is inﬂuencing souls for good or evil....</p>
      <p>If you connect with God, fearing Him, loving Him, obeying Him, and giving to the world a living example of what
          the Christian’s life should be, you will fulﬁll your obligation to God and to your fellow men. You are to show
          forth in your life what it means to love God with all your heart, and your neighbor as yourself. Connected
          with the God of wisdom and love, you will demonstrate to the world the fact that you are not living for this
          world, but for that which is not temporal but eternal.<span class="ft11">33</span></p>
