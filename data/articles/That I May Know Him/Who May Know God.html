    <h1>Who May Know God?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Canst thou by searching ﬁnd out God? canst thou ﬁnd out the Almighty unto perfection? Job 11:7. We
          cannot by searching ﬁnd out God, but He has revealed Himself in His Son, who is the brightness of
          the</strong></p>
      <p>Father’s glory and the express image of His person. If we desire a knowledge of God we must be
          Christlike....</p>
      <p>Living a pure life through faith in Christ as a personal Saviour will bring to the believer a clearer, higher
          conception of God....</p>
      <p>Eternal life is the reward that will be given to all who obey the two great principles of God’s
          <nobr>law—love</nobr> to God and love to man. The ﬁrst four commandments deﬁne and enjoin love to God; the
          last six, love to our fellow men. Obedience to these commands is the only evidence man can give that he
          possesses a genuine, saving knowledge of God. Love for God is demonstrated by love for those for whom Christ
          has died. While enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, Christ gave directions regarding this love. Distinctly and
          clearly He laid down the principles of heaven as rules that His chosen people were to observe in their
          dealings one with another. These principles Christ lived out in His life of humanity. In His teaching He
          presented the motives that should govern the lives of His followers....</p>
      <p>Those who partake of God’s love through a reception of the truth will give evidence of this by making earnest,
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> efforts to give the message of God’s love to others. Thus they become laborers
          together with Christ. Love for God and for one another unites them to Christ by golden links. Their life is
          bound up with His life in sanctiﬁed, elevated union.... This union causes rich currents of Christ’s love to
          ﬂow continually into</p>
      <p>the heart, and then ﬂow forth again in love for others.</p>
      <p>The qualities that it is essential for all to possess in order to know God are those that mark the completeness
          of Christ’s <nobr>character—His</nobr> love, His patience, His unselﬁshness. These attributes are cultivated
          by doing kind actions with a kindly heart.<span class="ft11">6</span></p>
