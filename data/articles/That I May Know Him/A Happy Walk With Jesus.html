    <h1>A Happy Walk With Jesus</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. Genesis 5:24.</strong></p>
      <p>Enoch lived in a corrupt age, when moral power was very weak. Pollution was teeming all around him, yet he
          walked with God. He educated his mind to <nobr>devotion—to</nobr> think on things that were pure and holy; and
          his conversation was upon holy and divine things. He was made a companion of God. He walked with Him, and
          received His counsel. He had to contend with the same temptations that we do. The society surrounding him was
          no more friendly to righteousness than is the society surrounding us at the present time. The atmosphere he
          breathed was tainted with sin and corruption, the same as ours, yet he was unsullied with the prevailing sins
          of the age in which he lived. And so may we remain as pure and uncorrupted as did the faithful Enoch.<span

      <p>We are living in an age when wickedness prevails. The perils of the last days thicken around us, and because
          iniquity abounds the love of many waxes cold.... The shortness of time is urged as an incentive for us to
          seek</p>
      <p>righteousness and to make Christ our friend. This is not the great motive. It savors of selﬁshness. Is it
          necessary that the terrors of the day of God be held before us to compel us through fear to right action? This
          ought not to be. Jesus is attractive. He is full of love, mercy, and compassion. He proposes to be our friend,
          to walk with us through all the rough pathways of life. He says to you, I am the Lord thy God; walk with Me,
          and I will ﬁll thy path with light. Jesus, the Majesty of heaven, proposes to elevate to companionship with
          Himself those who come to Him with their burdens, their weaknesses, and their cares. He will make them His
          dear children, and ﬁnally give them an inheritance of more value than the empires of kings, a crown of glory
          richer than has ever decked the brow of the most exalted earthly monarch....</p>
      <p>It is our privilege to have a calm, close, happy walk with Jesus every day we live.<span
