    <h1>The Mystery of Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so. ... Thou wast perfect in thy ways
          from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. Ezekiel 28:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>It is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason for its existence. Yet enough may be
          understood concerning both the origin and the ﬁnal disposition of sin, to make fully manifest the justice and
          benevolence of God in all His dealings with evil. Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God
          was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin.... Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason can be
          given.</p>
      <p>It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it, is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found, or cause be shown
          for its existence, it would cease to be sin. Our only deﬁnition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is
          “the transgression of the law;” (1 John 3:4) it is the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of
          love which is the foundation of the divine government.<span class="ft11">19</span></p>
      <p>Sin originated in <nobr>self-seeking.</nobr> Lucifer, the covering cherub, desired to be ﬁrst in heaven. He
          sought to gain control of heavenly beings, to draw them away from their Creator, and to win their homage to
          himself.... Thus he</p>
      <p>deceived angels. Thus he deceived men. He led them to doubt the word of God, and to distrust His
          goodness....</p>
      <p>Thus he drew men to join him in rebellion against God, and the night of woe settled down upon the world.<span
          class="ft20">20</span>Sin appeared in a perfect universe.... The reason of its inception or development was
          never explained and</p>
      <p>never can be, even at the last great day when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened.... At that day
          it</p>
      <p>will be evident to all that there is not, and never was, any cause for sin. At the ﬁnal condemnation of Satan
          and his angels and of all men who have ﬁnally identiﬁed themselves with him as transgressors of God’s law,
          every mouth will be stopped. When the hosts of rebellion, from the ﬁrst great rebel to the last transgressor,
          are asked why they have broken the law of God, they will be speechless. There will be no answer to give.<span
