    <h1>Christ Our Divine Ransom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath
          begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
          incorruptible, and undeﬁled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. 1 Peter 1:3,
          4.</strong></p>
      <p>“In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9). Men need to understand that Deity
          suffered and sank under the agonies of Calvary. Yet Jesus Christ, whom God gave for the ransom of the world,
          purchased the church with His own blood. The Majesty of heaven was made to suffer at the hands of religious
          zealots, who claimed to be the most enlightened people upon the face of the earth.</p>
      <p>Men whom God had created, and who were dependent upon Him for every moment of their lives, who claimed to be
          the children of Abraham, worked out the wrath of Satan upon the innocent Son of the inﬁnite God. While Christ
          was bearing the heavy guilt incurred by transgression of the law, while in the very act of bearing our sins,
          of carrying our sorrows, He was mocked ... by the chief priests and rulers.... It was there that mercy
          and</p>
      <p>truth met together, righteousness and peace embraced each other. Here is a theme which all need to understand.
          Here are lengths and breadths, depths and heights, that pass any computation....</p>
      <p>The character of Christ is an inﬁnitely perfect character. The Word declares Him. He is lifted up and
          proclaimed as the One who gave His life for the life of the world.... Christ gave His own life, that all the
          disloyal</p>
      <p>and disobedient might realize the truth of the promise given in the ﬁrst chapter of John: “As many as received
          him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name” (John 1:12). Tell
          it over and over again. We may become the sons of God, members of the royal family, children of the heavenly
          King. All who accept Jesus Christ and hold the beginning of their conﬁdence ﬁrm unto the end will be heirs of
          God and joint heirs with Christ to “an inheritance incorruptible, and undeﬁled, and that fadeth not
          away.”<span class="ft22">6</span></p>
