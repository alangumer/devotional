    <h1>Watch for God’s Guidance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto
          the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us. Psalm
          123:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The children of God should cultivate a keen sensitiveness to sin.... It is one of Satan’s most successful
          devices</p>
      <p>to lead men to the commission of little sins, to blind the mind to the danger of little indulgences, little
          digressions from the plainly stated requirements of God. Many who would shrink with horror from some great
          transgression are led to look upon sin in little matters as of triﬂing consequence. But these little sins eat
          out the life of godliness in the soul....</p>
      <p>God requires us to prove our loyalty to Him by unquestioning obedience. In deciding upon any course we should
          not ask merely whether we can see harm to result from it, but whether it is contrary to the will of God. We
          must learn to distrust self and to rely wholly upon God for guidance and support, for a knowledge of His will,
          and for strength to perform it. We must be much in communion with God. Prayer in secret, prayer while the
          hands are engaged in labor, prayer while walking by the way, prayer in the night season, the heart’s desires
          ever ascending to <nobr>God—this</nobr> is our only safety. In this manner Enoch walked with God. In this
          manner our Exemplar obtained strength to tread the thorny path from Nazareth to Calvary.</p>
      <p>Christ the sinless One, upon whom the Holy Spirit was bestowed without measure, constantly acknowledged His
          dependence upon God, and sought fresh supplies from the Source of strength and wisdom. How much more should
          ﬁnite, erring man feel his need of help from God every hour and every moment. How carefully should he follow
          the leading Hand, how carefully treasure every word that has been given for his guidance and instruction! “As
          the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
          mistress,” so should our eyes be upon the Lord our God. His commands should be received with implicit faith,
          and obeyed with cheerful exactness.<span class="ft17">3</span></p>
