    <h1>Rich Depths of Knowledge</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
          myself. John 7:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The more earnestly we apply our minds to the investigation of truth, the clearer will the evidences of truth
          appear, and the more closely we relate ourselves to the God of all wisdom, coming into communion with Him who
          has created all things, the richer will be our knowledge, the more fully shall we comprehend divine truth. God
          has graciously endowed men with intellectual powers, and these powers are to be wisely improved, that men may
          have ability to search into and understand rich depths of knowledge in the character, Word, and works of God.
          God will open the treasures of His love to the willing and obedient; he that willeth to do the will of God
          shall know of the doctrine.</p>
      <p>By communion with God we become reﬁned, broadened, and elevated. To him who desires the knowledge of divine
          things, God will open hidden wonders that are beyond the comprehension of those who are unenlightened by the
          Spirit of God....</p>
      <p>The great gift of salvation has been placed within our reach at an inﬁnite cost to the Father and the Son. To
          neglect salvation is to neglect the knowledge of the Father and of the Son whom God hath sent....</p>
      <p>The greatness, the breadth, of the plan of salvation invests it with incomparable grandeur, but it can only be
          spiritually discerned, and it increases in greatness as we contemplate it. Looking to Jesus dying upon the
          cross, and knowing that it was our sin that placed the innocent Sufferer there, we are bowed down before Him
          in wonder and love.<span class="ft11">27</span></p>
      <p>All who come to Christ for a clearer knowledge of the truth will receive it. He will unfold to them the
          mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, and these mysteries will be understood by the heart that longs to know the
          truth. A heavenly light will shine into the soul temple and will be revealed to others as the bright shining
          of a lamp on a dark path.<span class="ft11">28</span></p>
