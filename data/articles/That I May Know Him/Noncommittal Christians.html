    <h1>Noncommittal Christians</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a
          candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
          Matthew 5:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>Let no one feel inclined to hide his light. Those who hide their light so that the world may not distinguish
          between them and those who walk in darkness will soon lose all power to diffuse light. They are the ones who
          are represented by the ﬁve foolish virgins, and when the crisis comes, when the call is heard “Behold, the
          bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him” (Matthew 25:6), they will arouse at last to ﬁnd that their lamps
          have gone out, that they have mixed with the elements of the world and have not provided themselves with the
          oil of grace. They were lulled to sleep by the cry of peace and safety, and did not keep their lamps trimmed
          and burning. Aroused to their darkness they plead for oil, but it is impossible for one Christian to impart
          character to another soul. Character is not transferable. Those who are
          <nobr>ease-loving,</nobr><nobr>world-loving,</nobr><nobr>fashion-loving</nobr> professors of Christianity will
          not go in to the marriage supper of the Lamb with those who are represented by the ﬁve wise virgins. When they
          solicit entrance they are told that the door is shut. Now is the time to impart light....</p>
      <p>It is not to be looked upon as a triﬂing matter to have the light of present truth, and yet to be noncommittal.
          It is no triﬂing thing to say by attitude and sentiment, even though that sentiment is not expressed in words,
          “My Lord delayeth his coming.” The spirit and inﬂuence of the peace and safety sentiment is in our very midst,
          and the very atmosphere that surrounds the soul of many who profess to be believers in the soon coming of
          Christ is of a malarious character, calculated to soothe the very ones who would be stirred if we showed zeal
          and determination and stood at our post of duty to warn men of the speedy advent of our Lord....We must speak
          forth</p>
      <p>the truth, we must let our light shine forth in clear, steady rays, lest some soul shall stumble and fall
          because our light is eclipsed.<span class="ft15">45</span></p>
