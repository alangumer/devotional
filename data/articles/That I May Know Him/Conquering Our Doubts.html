    <h1>Conquering Our Doubts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? Matthew 14:31.</strong></p>
      <p>“Wherefore didst thou doubt?” said Christ to the sinking Peter. The same question may be addressed to
          us....</p>
      <p>The Lord has pledged Himself to give us strength to enable us to stand. As we search the Scriptures we ﬁnd
          ground for conﬁdence, provision for sufﬁciency. It is our privilege to say boldly, yet humbly, The Lord is my
          helper, therefore I shall not be moved from my steadfastness. My life is hid with Christ in God. Because He
          lives, I shall live also. Let us pledge ourselves before God and the angels of heaven that we will not
          dishonor God by speaking words of discouragement or unbelief.... Close the door to distrust and open the door
          wide to</p>
      <p>faith. Invite into the soul temple the heavenly Guest.</p>
      <p>You may have your choice as to who shall rule your heart and control your mind. If you choose to open the door
          to the suggestions of the evil one, your mind will be ﬁlled with distrust and rebellious questioning. You may
          talk out your feelings, but every doubt you utter is a seed that will germinate and bear fruit in another’s
          life, and it will be impossible to counteract the inﬂuence of your words. You may be able to recover from your
          season of temptation ... , but others that have been swayed by your inﬂuence may not be able to escape from
          the unbelief you have suggested. How important it is that we speak to those around us only those things which
          will give spiritual strength and enlightenment!</p>
      <p>It is our duty to encourage faith, to talk faith that we may have faith. If we talk doubt and encourage doubt
          we shall have abundant doubt, for Satan will help us in this kind of work. We need sanctiﬁed hearts and
          sanctiﬁed lips. We need to breathe in the rich, bracing atmosphere that comes from the heavenly Canaan.... Why
          should</p>
      <p>we ﬁll the gallery of the mind with gloomy scenes of doubt? Why not let the bright beams of the Sun of
          Righteousness shine into the chambers of heart and mind, and dispel the shadows of unbelief? Turn to the
          Light, to Jesus the precious Saviour.<span class="ft11">15</span></p>
