    <h1>Now is the Time to Shine</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. Isaiah
          60:1.</strong></p>
      <p>We need now to arise and shine, for our light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon us. We have no
          time to talk of self, no time to become like the sensitive plant, that cannot be touched without shrinking. In
          Jesus Christ is our sufﬁciency. Will we talk faith? Will we talk of the glorious hope, of the full and
          abundant righteousness of Jesus Christ, provided for every soul? ...</p>
      <p>The whole heavenly universe is interested, and the love of God is exercised in behalf of His faithful,
          <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people. It is God in whom we must trust.... God has the world in His hand. We
          have</p>
      <p>God on our side. All heaven is waiting and longing for our cooperation. The Lord is supreme. Why then should we
          fear? The Lord is almighty; why should we tremble? In the past God has delivered His people, and He will be
          our helper if we will arise in His strength and go forward.</p>
      <p>The Bible and the Bible only is to be our refuge. God is in His Word. “He shall see of the travail of his soul,
          and shall be satisﬁed.” That is enough for us. “By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for
          he shall bear their iniquities” (Isaiah 53:11). If the great and loving heart of God is satisﬁed with the
          result of His mission in the souls saved, let us rejoice. Let us work as we have never done before. Let us put
          self aside and lay hold of Jesus Christ by faith. Let us reveal Him to the world as the One altogether lovely
          and the chiefest among ten thousand.</p>
      <p>“After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and
          people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
          their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto
          the Lamb” (Revelation 7:9, 10).<span class="ft15">2</span></p>
