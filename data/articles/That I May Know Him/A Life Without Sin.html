    <h1>A Life Without Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our inﬁrmities; but was in all
          points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 4:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Let us consider how much it cost our Saviour in the wilderness of temptation to carry on in our behalf the
          conﬂict with the wily, malignant foe. Satan knew that everything depended upon his success or failure in his
          attempt to overcome Christ with his manifold temptations. Satan knew that the plan of salvation would be
          carried out to its fulﬁllment, that his power would be taken away, that his destruction would be certain, if
          Christ bore the test that Adam failed to endure. The temptations of Satan were most effective in degrading
          human nature, for man could not stand against their powerful inﬂuence; but Christ in man’s behalf, as man’s
          representative, resting wholly upon the power of God, endured the severe conﬂict, in order that He might be a
          perfect example to us. There is hope for man.... The work before us is to overcome as Christ overcame. He
          fasted forty days,</p>
      <p>and suffered the keenest pangs of hunger. Christ suffered on our account beyond our comprehension, and we
          should welcome trial and suffering on our own account for Christ’s sake, that we may overcome as Christ also
          overcame, and be exalted to the throne of our Redeemer....</p>
      <p>We have everything to gain in the conﬂict with our mighty foe, and we dare not for a moment yield to his
          temptations. We know that in our own strength it is not possible for us to succeed; but as Christ humbled
          Himself, and took upon Himself our nature, He is acquainted with our necessities, and has Himself borne the
          heaviest temptations that man will have to bear, has conquered the enemy in resisting his suggestions, in
          order that man may learn how to be conqueror. He was clothed with a body like ours, and in every respect
          suffered what man will suffer, and very much more. We shall never be called upon to suffer as Christ suffered,
          for the sins not of one, but the sins of the whole world were laid upon Christ. He endured humiliation,
          reproach, suffering, and death, that we by following His example might inherit all things.<span
