      <p><strong>Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. Proverbs
          20:11.</strong></p>
      <p>God wants the children and youth to join the Lord’s army.... The children have as strong temptations to
          meet,</p>
      <p>on the right hand and on the left, as do the older soldiers. Satan and his legions will work every device to
          ensnare the young. It is the privilege of the children to enlist in the army of the Lord and seek to persuade
          others to join their ranks. Children must be educated and trained for Jesus Christ. They must be trained to
          resist temptation and to ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. Direct their minds to Jesus as soon as they can
          comprehend your lessons in simple words, easy to be understood. Teach them <nobr>self-control.</nobr> Teach
          them to begin the work of overcoming when young, and they will receive the precious help that Jesus can and
          will give, connected with prayerful efforts of parents. Cheer them with encouraging words for the battles they
          ﬁght in resisting temptation and coming off conquerors through grace given them of Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>Parents should hang in memory’s hall the precious sayings of Christ. The children will repeat the words they
          hear often on the parents’ <nobr>lips—of</nobr> Christ, and faith, and truth. Precious truth may be spoken by
          children. Whole armies of children may come under Christ’s banner as missionaries, even in their childhood
          years. Never repulse the desire of children to do something for Jesus. Never quench their ardor for working in
          some way for the Master. Children rightly educated will learn to love Jesus and to grieve if they think they
          have grieved the Saviour by any sin committed by them. Keep their hearts tender and sensitive by your own
          words and example.<span class="ft22">7</span></p>
      <p>The angels of God are ever near your little ones.... Let love and tenderness, patience and
          <nobr>self-control,</nobr> be at</p>
      <p>all times the law of your speech. Winning love is to be like deep waters, ever ﬂowing forth in the management
          of your children. All through His life, Christ performed acts of love and tenderness for the children.<span
