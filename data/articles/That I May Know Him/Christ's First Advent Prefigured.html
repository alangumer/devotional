    <h1>Christ’s First Advent Preﬁgured</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing
          rather to suffer afﬂiction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Hebrews
          11:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>While he was sitting under the very shadow of the throne, the Spirit of the Lord stirred his heart to lift the
          crushing weight that was pressing his brethren into the lowest degradation and slavery. His heart ached with
          sorrow, as if he himself were in slavery, laboring in the brick kiln, and sharing their degradation. They were
          slaves, suffering under the cruel lash. They were a reproach and a hissing to all the Egyptians, from Pharaoh
          down to the lowest serf.</p>
      <p>But the Lord had singled out Moses as the one to deliver the oppressed race, and by forty years of exile, under
          the discipline of God, he was prepared for the work. Understanding the evil disposition of his own countrymen,
          knowing how many would be perverse and unreasonable, understanding that they might betray him, he was yet
          considering ways and means to accomplish their deliverance, though supposing that he himself had forfeited all
          right to be the instrument. But God, in the bush which though burning was yet unconsumed by the ﬁre, presented
          Himself, and selected Moses as His agent....</p>
      <p>Moses was accepted as a <nobr>co-worker</nobr> with God. He knew that scorn, hatred, persecution, and maybe
          death would be his portion if he should act any part in espousing the cause of the Hebrew captives.... He had
          stood in</p>
      <p>great popularity as the general of Pharaoh’s armies, and he knew that now his name would be bandied round and
          falsiﬁed, but he esteemed “the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt” (Hebrews 11:26).
          He laid down the prospect of a kingly crown, and took up the burdens of his oppressed and afﬂicted
          people.<span class="ft22">33</span></p>
      <p>Moses was chosen of God to break the yoke of bondage upon the children of Israel, and ... in his work he
          preﬁgured Christ’s ﬁrst advent to break Satan’s power over the human family and deliver those who were made
          captives by his power.<span class="ft11">34</span></p>
