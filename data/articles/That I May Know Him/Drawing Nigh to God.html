    <h1>Drawing Nigh to God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. James 4:8.</strong></p>
      <p>We should seek to understand what it means to draw nigh to God. We are to come near to Him, not to stand a
          great way off, for in that case we shall not be able to feel the inﬂuence of His divine Spirit. Those who came
          into the presence of Christ, drawing nigh to Him, could more readily breathe in the atmosphere that surrounded
          Him, catch His spirit, and be impressed with His lessons. We are engaged in a serious, solemn work, and we
          should seek to be in that humble position, to have that teachable spirit, that the Lord can impress our
          hearts, and that we may feel His drawing power. We never draw nigh to God but that He is drawing us.<span

      <p>God has angels whose whole work is to draw those who shall be heirs of salvation. Whenever one takes a step
          toward Jesus, Jesus is taking steps toward him. The angels’ work is to keep back the powers of Satan.<span
          class="ft22">40</span></p>
      <p>Those who are ever pressing a little closer to the world, and becoming more like them in feelings, in plans, in
          ideas, have left a space between them and the Saviour, and Satan has pressed his way into this space, and low,
          <nobr>worldly-tainted,</nobr> selﬁsh plans become interwoven with their experience.<span
          class="ft11">41</span></p>
      <p>If we draw nigh to God, we shall draw nigh to one another. We cannot draw nigh to the same cross without coming
          into unity of spirit. Christ prayed that His disciples should be one as He and the Father are one. We should
          seek to be one in spirit and in understanding. We should seek to be one that God may be gloriﬁed in us as He
          was gloriﬁed in the Son, and God will love us as He loves His Son.<span class="ft11">42</span></p>
      <p>God loves you. He does not wish to draw you nigh to Him to hurt you, oh, no; but to comfort you, to pour in the
          oil of rejoicing, to heal the wounds that sin has made, to bind up where Satan has bruised. He wants to give
          you the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness.<span class="ft15">43</span></p>
