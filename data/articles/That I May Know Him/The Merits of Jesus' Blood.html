    <h1>The Merits of Jesus’ Blood</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. Psalm 34:2. He
          realizes that an inﬁnite sacriﬁce has been made for him, and that his life is of inestimable value
          through</strong></p>
      <p>the merits of Jesus’ blood, intercession, and righteousness. But while he comprehends the exalted privileges of
          the sons of God, his soul is ﬁlled with humility. There is no boasting of holiness from the lips of those who
          walk in the shadow of Calvary’s cross. They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that broke the
          heart of the Son of God.... Those who live nearest to Jesus feel most deeply their own unworthiness, and their
          only</p>
      <p>hope is in the merits of a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour. Like Moses, they have had a view of the awful majesty of
          holiness and they see their own insufﬁciency in contrast with the purity and exalted loveliness of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Is there not occasion for humility? Is there not need of feeling our utter dependence upon Christ every day and
          hour? ... He took on Him our nature, and became sin for us, that we might have “remission of sins that are
          past” (Romans 3:25), and through His divine strength and grace might fulﬁll the righteous requirements of the
          law. Whoever takes the position that it makes no difference whether or not we keep the commandments of God is
          not acquainted with Christ. Jesus says, “I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love” (John
          15:10), and those who follow Jesus will do as He has done....</p>
      <p>Satan will seek to entice you to enter into the paths of sin, promising that some wonderful good will result
          from the transgression of God’s law, but he is a deceiver. He would only work your ruin.... Christ came
          to</p>
      <p>break the rule of the evil one.... Man was so weakened through transgression that he did not possess
          sufﬁcient</p>
      <p>moral power to turn from the service of Satan to the service of the only true God; but Jesus, the Prince of
          life, to whom is committed “all power in heaven and earth,” will impart to every soul who desires salvation
          the strength necessary to overcome the enemy of all righteousness.<span class="ft15">42</span></p>
