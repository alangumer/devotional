    <h1>Source of All Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not
          walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. John 8:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus of Nazareth declared Himself the Light of the world. What think ye of Him? What position does He occupy
          among the world’s religious teachers? Hundreds, yes thousands, of men are recognized as having been great
          thinkers, men who speculated, who published their theories, and charmed the minds of many with their
          intellectual and moral attainments. These <nobr>so-called</nobr> great men who have left to the world the
          productions of their life of thought have been ranked as the wisest men the world has ever known. But these
          cannot compare with Christ. There was a revelation before man’s productions were brought forth. His ﬁnite
          knowledge is but the result of beholding the wondrous things that have been shining in our world contained in
          the teachings of Christ, the greatest of all teachers. Whatever great ideas man may have evolved have come
          through Christ. Every precious gem of thought every ﬂash of the intellect, is revealed by the Light of the
          world....</p>
      <p>Christ makes no apology when He declares, “I am the light of the world.” He was, in life and teaching, the
          gospel, the foundation of all pure doctrine. Just as the sun compares with the lesser lights in the heavens,
          so did Christ, the Source of light, compare with the teachers of His day. He was before them all, and shining
          with the brightness of the sun, He diffused His penetrating, gladdening rays throughout the world....</p>
      <p>Measured by ﬁnite minds, men are called learned and great, but with all their boasted wisdom, their science and
          learning, they cannot thus know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.... No man who has ever lived, or</p>
      <p>who ever will live, can claim to be the infallible guide, the supreme revealer of truth. Men may seek to reach
          the highest standard in learning, but there is One, “a teacher sent from God,” who still stands higher than
          they. No human teacher can equal Him.<span class="ft11">1</span></p>
