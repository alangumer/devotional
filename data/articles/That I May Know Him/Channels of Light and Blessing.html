    <h1>Channels of Light and Blessing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant
          men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. Acts 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The world cannot see the beauty, the loveliness, goodness, and holiness of divine truth. And in order that men
          may understand it, there must be a channel through which it shall come to the world. The Saviour has
          constituted the church that channel.... Christ has revealed Himself to us that we may reveal Him to
          others....</p>
      <p>If those who claim to be Christians will heed the words of Christ, all who come in contact with them will
          acknowledge that they have been with Jesus and have learned of Him....</p>
      <p>Simple faith in the atoning blood can save my soul; and with John, I must call the attention of all to the Lamb
          of God which taketh away the sin of the world. Jesus has saved me, though I had nothing to present to Him, and
          could only say, “In my hand no price I bring, Simply to thy cross I cling.” Never did a sinner seek the
          Saviour with the whole heart but that the Saviour was found of him....</p>
      <p>We may claim the blessed assurance, “I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions” (Isaiah 44:22).
          Thy “sins, which are many, are forgiven” (Luke 7:47). O how precious, how refreshing, is the sunlight of God’s
          love! The sinner may look upon his <nobr>sin-stained</nobr> life, and say, “Who is he that condemneth? It is
          Christ that died” (Romans 8:34). “Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound” (Romans 5:20). Christ the
          Restorer plants a new principle of life in the soul, and that plant grows and produces fruit. The grace of
          Christ puriﬁes while it pardons, and ﬁts men for a holy heaven. We are to grow in grace and in the knowledge
          of our Lord Jesus Christ until we reach the full stature of men and women in Christ. O that we might all reach
          the high standard which God has set before us, and no longer remain dwarfs in the religious life! What beams
          of light would be reﬂected to the world in good works if we should become light bearers such as God would have
          us!<span class="ft22">32</span></p>
