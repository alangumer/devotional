    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
          sanctiﬁcation, and redemption. 1 Corinthians 1:30.</strong></p>
      <p>It is growth in knowledge of the character of Christ that sanctiﬁes the soul. To discern and appreciate the
          wonderful work of the atonement transforms him who contemplates the plan of salvation. By beholding Christ he
          becomes changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. The beholding of Jesus
          becomes an ennobling, reﬁning process.... The perfection of Christ’s character is the Christian’s
          inspiration....</p>
      <p>Christ should never be out of the mind. The angels said concerning Him, “Thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he
          shall save his people from their sins” (Matthew 1:21). Jesus, precious Saviour! assurance, helpfulness,
          security, and peace are all in Him. He is the dispeller of all our doubts, the earnest of all our hopes. How
          precious is the thought that we may indeed become partakers of the divine nature, whereby we may overcome as
          Christ overcame! Jesus is the fullness of our expectation. He is the melody of our songs, the shadow of a
          great rock in a weary land. He is living water to the thirsty soul. He is our refuge in the storm. He is our
          righteousness, our sanctiﬁcation, our redemption.<span class="ft11">12</span></p>
      <p>The power of Christ is to be the comfort, the hope, the crown of rejoicing, of every one that follows Jesus in
          his conﬂict, in his struggles in life. He who truly follows the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the
          world, can shout as he advances, “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith” (1 John
          5:4).</p>
      <p>What kind of faith is it that overcomes the world? It is that faith which makes Christ your own personal
          <nobr>Saviour—that</nobr> faith which, recognizing your helplessness, your utter inability to save yourself,
          takes hold of the helper who is mighty to save, as your only hope. It is faith that will not be discouraged,
          that hears the voice of Christ saying, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world, and my divine strength is
          yours.” ... “Lo, I am with you alway.”<span class="ft11">13</span></p>
