    <h1>The March to Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:57.
          Nothing can be more helpless, nothing can be more dependent, than the soul that feels its nothingness and
          relies wholly upon the merits of the blood of a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour. The Christian life is a life of
          warfare, of continual conﬂict. It is a battle and a march. But every act of obedience to Christ, every act of
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> for His sake, every trial well endured, every victory gained over temptation, is a
          step in the march to the glory of</strong></p>
      <p>ﬁnal victory.</p>
      <p>If we take Christ for our guide, He will lead us safely along the narrow way. The road may be rough and thorny;
          the ascent may be steep and dangerous; there may be pitfalls upon the right hand and upon the left; we may
          have to endure toil in our journey; when weary, when longing for rest, we may have to toil on; when faint, we
          may have to ﬁght; when discouraged, we may be called upon to hope; but with Christ as our Guide we shall not
          lose the path to immortal life, we shall not fail to reach the desired haven at last.</p>
      <p>Christ Himself has trod the rough pathway before us and has smoothed the path for our feet. The narrow path of
          holiness, the way cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in, is illuminated by Him who is the light of
          the world. As we follow in His steps, His light will shine upon us, and as we reﬂect the light borrowed from
          the glory of Christ, the path will grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.</p>
      <p>We may think it pleasant at ﬁrst to follow pride and worldly ambition, but the end is pain and sorrow. Selﬁsh
          plans may present ﬂattering promises and hold out the hope of enjoyment, but we shall ﬁnd that our happiness
          is poisoned and our life embittered by hopes that center in self. In following Christ we are safe, for He will
          not suffer the powers of darkness to hurt one hair of our heads. He will keep that which is committed to His
          trust, and we shall be more than conquerors through Him that loved us.<span class="ft11">4</span></p>
