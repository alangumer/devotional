    <h1>Water for the Thirsty</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him
          come unto me, and drink. John 7:37.</strong></p>
      <p>Once a year, at the Feast of Tabernacles, the children of Israel called to mind the time when their fathers
          dwelt in tents in the wilderness, as they journeyed from Egypt to the land of Canaan. The services of the last
          day of this feast were of peculiar solemnity, but the greatest interest centered in the ceremony that
          commemorated the bringing of water from the rock. When in a golden vessel the waters of Siloam were borne by
          the priests into the temple, and, after being mingled with wine, were poured over the sacriﬁce on the altar,
          there was great rejoicing.... On this occasion, above all the confusion of the crowd and the sounds of
          rejoicing, a voice is heard:</p>
      <p>“If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.” The attention of the people is arrested. Outwardly all is
          joy, but the eye of Jesus, beholding the throng with the tenderest compassion, sees the soul parched and
          thirsting for the waters of life....</p>
      <p>The gracious invitation, “Come unto me, and drink,” comes down through all the ages to our time. And we may
          stand in a position similar to that of the Jews in the time of Christ, rejoicing because the fountain of truth
          has been opened to us, while its living waters are not permitted to refresh our thirsty souls. We must
          drink....</p>
      <p>As the children of Israel celebrated the deliverance that God wrought for their fathers, and His miraculous
          preservation of them during their journeyings from Egypt to the Promised Land, so should the people of God at
          the present time gratefully call to mind the various ways He has devised to bring them out from the world, out
          from the darkness of error, into the precious light of truth.... We should gratefully regard the old waymarks,
          and</p>
      <p>refresh our souls with memories of the <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> of our gracious Benefactor....</p>
      <p>As we journey onward, what a blessed privilege is ours to accept the invitation of Christ, “If any man thirst,
          let him come unto me, and drink.”<span class="ft15">14</span></p>
