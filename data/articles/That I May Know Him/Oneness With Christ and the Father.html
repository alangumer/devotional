    <h1>Oneness With Christ and the Father</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us:
          that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. John 17:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Let these words be oft repeated and let every soul train his ideas and spirit and action daily that he may
          fulﬁll this prayer of Jesus Christ. He does not request impossible things of His Father. He prays for the very
          things which must be in His disciples in relation to their oneness to each other and their unity and oneness
          with God and Jesus Christ. Anything short of this is not attaining to perfection of Christian character. The
          golden chain of love, binding the hearts of the believers in unity, in bonds of fellowship and love, and in
          oneness with Christ and the Father, makes the connection perfect, and bears to the world a testimony of the
          power of Christianity that cannot be controverted....</p>
      <p>Then will selﬁshness be uprooted and unfaithfulness will not exist. There will not be strife and divisions.
          There will not be stubbornness in anyone who is bound up with Christ. Not one will act out the stubborn
          independence of the wayward, impulsive child who drops the hand that is leading him and chooses to stumble on
          alone....</p>
      <p>“A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one
          another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” (John 13:34,
          35). Satan understands the power of such a testimony as a witness to the world of what grace can do in
          transforming character. He is not pleased that such a light shall shine forth from those who claim to believe
          in Jesus Christ, and he will work every conceivable device to break this golden chain which links heart to
          heart of those who believe the truth and binds them up in close connection with the Father and the
          Son....</p>
      <p>We believe in Jesus Christ. We unite our souls to Christ. He says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
          you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.... These things I command you, that ye love
          one</p>
      <p>another.” (John 15:16, 17).<span class="ft15">22</span></p>
