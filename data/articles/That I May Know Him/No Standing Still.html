      <p><strong>To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour
          Jesus Christ: grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord. 2
          Peter 1:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>What a grand theme this is for <nobr>contemplation—the</nobr> righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus
          Christ! Contemplating Christ and His righteousness leaves no room for <nobr>self-righteousness,</nobr> for the
          glorifying of self. In this chapter there is no standstill. There is continual advancement in every stage in
          the knowledge of Christ. Through the knowledge of Christ is life eternal. In His prayer Jesus says, “This is
          life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3).
          In God we are to glory....</p>
      <p>“But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctiﬁcation,
          and redemption: that, according as it is written. He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord” (1 Corinthians
          1:30, 31)....</p>
      <p>We have been called to the knowledge of Christ, and that is to the knowledge of glory and virtue. It is a
          knowledge of the perfection of the divine character, manifested to us in Jesus Christ, that opens up to us
          communion with God. It is by the great and precious promises that we are to become partakers of the divine
          nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</p>
      <p>What possibilities are opened up to the youth who lay hold of the divine assurances of God’s Word! Scarcely can
          the human mind comprehend what is the breadth and depth and height of the spiritual attainments that can be
          reached by becoming partakers of the divine nature. The human agent who yields obedience to God, Who becomes a
          partaker of the divine nature, ﬁnds pleasure in keeping the commandments of God, for he is one with God; he
          holds as vital a relation with God as does the Son to the Father.<span class="ft22">2</span></p>
      <p>What privileges and blessings are granted to those who have obtained like precious faith with the disciples of
          Christ! Nothing is withheld from them.<span class="ft15">3</span></p>
