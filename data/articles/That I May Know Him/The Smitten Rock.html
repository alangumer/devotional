    <h1>The Smitten Rock</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there
          shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
          Exodus 17:6.</strong></p>
      <p>From the smitten rock in Horeb ﬁrst ﬂowed the living stream that refreshed Israel in the desert. During all
          their wanderings, wherever the need existed, they were supplied with water by a miracle of God’s
          mercy....</p>
      <p>It was Christ, by the power of His word, that caused the refreshing stream to ﬂow for Israel. “They drank of
          that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ” (1 Corinthians 10:4). He was the source of
          all temporal as well as spiritual blessings. Christ, the true Rock, was with them in all their wanderings.
          “They thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to ﬂow out of the rock for
          them.” “They ran in the dry places like a river” (Isaiah 48:21; Psalm 105:41).</p>
      <p>The smitten rock was a ﬁgure of Christ, and through this symbol the most precious spiritual truths are taught.
          As the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> waters ﬂowed from the smitten rock, so from Christ, “smitten of God,” “wounded
          for our transgressions,” “bruised for our iniquities” (Isaiah 53:4, 5), the stream of salvation ﬂows for a
          lost race. As the rock had been once smitten, so Christ was to be “once offered to bear the sins of many”
          (Hebrews 9:28). Our Saviour was not to be sacriﬁced a second time; and it is only necessary for those who seek
          the blessings of His grace to ask in the name of Jesus, pouring forth the heart’s desire in penitential
          prayer. Such prayer will bring before the Lord of hosts the wounds of Jesus, and then will ﬂow forth afresh
          the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> blood, symbolized by the ﬂowing of the living water for Israel....</p>
      <p>The refreshing water, welling up in a parched and barren land, ... is an emblem of the divine grace which
          Christ alone can bestow, and which is as the living water purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul. He
          in whom Christ is abiding has within him a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> fountain of grace and strength.<span
