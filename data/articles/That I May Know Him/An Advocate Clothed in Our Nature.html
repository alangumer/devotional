    <h1>An Advocate Clothed in Our Nature</h1>

      <p><strong>My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an
          advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 1 John 2:1.</strong></p>
      <p>God’s appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit. The throne of grace itself is occupied by One
          who permits us to call Him Father.... He has placed at His altar an Advocate clothed in our nature. As
          our</p>
      <p>Intercessor, Christ’s ofﬁce work is to introduce us to God as His sons and daughters. He intercedes in behalf
          of those who receive Him. With His own blood He has paid their ransom. By virtue of His merits He gives them
          power to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. And the Father demonstrates His
          inﬁnite love for Christ by receiving and welcoming Christ’s friends as His friends. He is satisﬁed with the
          atonement made. He is gloriﬁed by the incarnation, the life, death, and mediation of His son.</p>
      <p>In Christ’s name our petitions ascend to the Father. He intercedes in our behalf, and the Father lays open all
          the treasures of His grace for our appropriation, for us to enjoy and impart to others....</p>
      <p>Christ is the connecting link between God and man.... He places the whole virtue of His righteousness on</p>
      <p>the side of the suppliant. He pleads for man, and man, in need of divine help, pleads for himself in the
          presence of God, using the inﬂuence of the One who gave His life for the life of the world. As we acknowledge
          before God our appreciation of Christ’s merits, fragrance is given to our intercessions. As we approach God
          through the virtue of the Redeemer’s merits, Christ places us close by His side, encircling us with His human
          arm, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Inﬁnite. He puts His merits, as sweet incense, in
          the censer in our hands, in order to encourage our petitions....</p>
      <p>Yes, Christ has become the medium of prayer between man and God. He has also become the medium of blessing
          between God and man.<span class="ft15">15</span></p>
