    <h1>Love So Amazing!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
          not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Having undertaken the work of man’s redemption, the Father would spare nothing, however dear, which was
          essential for the completion of His work. He would make opportunities for men; He would pour upon them His
          blessings; He would heap favor upon favor, gift upon gift, until the whole treasury of heaven was open to
          those whom He came to save. Having collected all the riches of the universe, and laid open all the resources
          of His divine nature, God gave them all for the use of man. They were His free gift. What an ocean of love is
          circulating, like a divine atmosphere, around the world! What manner of love is this, that the eternal God
          should adopt human nature in the person of His Son, and carry the same into the highest heaven!</p>
      <p>All the heavenly intelligences were watching with intense interest the warfare that was going on upon the
          <nobr>earth—the</nobr> earth that Satan claimed as his dominion. Every moment was big with eternal realities.
          How would the conﬂict end? The angels looked for the justice of God to be revealed, His anger to be aroused
          against the prince of darkness and his sympathizers. But lo, mercy prevailed. When the Son of God might have
          come to the world to condemn, He came as righteousness and peace, to save not merely the descendants of
          Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but all the <nobr>world—every</nobr> son and daughter of Adam who would believe on
          Him, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. What an exhibition of the love of Jehovah! This is love without a
          parallel.<span class="ft17">28</span></p>
      <p>Our Redeemer determined on nothing less than that through His merits the love of God should be transfused
          through the soul that believes in Him. As our life, the vitality of God’s love is to circulate through every
          part of our nature, that it may abide in us as it dwells in Christ Jesus. United with Christ by living faith,
          the Father loves us as the members of Christ’s mystical body, of which Christ is the gloriﬁed head.<span
