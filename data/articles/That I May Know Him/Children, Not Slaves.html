    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God
          acceptably with reverence and godly fear. Hebrews 12:28.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many who profess to be Christ’s followers and yet are not doers of His Word. They do not relish this
          Word because it presents service which is not agreeable to them. They do not relish the wholesome reproofs and
          close, earnest appeals. They do not love righteousness, but are mastered and tyrannized over by their own
          erratic, human impulses.</p>
      <p>It makes every difference how we do service for God. The boy who drudges through his lessons because he must
          learn will never become a real student. The man who claims to keep the commandments of God because he thinks
          he must do it will never enter into the enjoyment of obedience.</p>
      <p>The essence and ﬂavor of all obedience is the outworking of a principle <nobr>within—the</nobr> love of
          righteousness, the love of the law of God. The essence of all righteousness is loyalty to our Redeemer, doing
          right because it is right. When the Word of God is a burden because it cuts directly across human
          inclinations, then the religious life is not a Christian life, but a tug and a strain, an enforced obedience.
          All the purity and godliness of religion are set aside.</p>
      <p>But adoption into the family of God makes us children, not slaves. When the love of Christ enters the heart we
          strive to imitate the character of Christ.... The more we study the life of Christ with a heart to learn, the
          more</p>
      <p>Christlike we become. Into the heart of every true doer of the Word the Holy Spirit infuses clear
          understanding. The more we crucify selﬁsh practices by imparting our blessings to others and by exercising our
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> ability, the more the heavenly graces will be strengthened and increased in us. We will
          grow in spirituality, in patience, in fortitude, in meekness, in gentleness.... A train of cars is not merely
          attached to the engine; they</p>
      <p>follow on the same track as the engine. Whom are we following?<span class="ft15">32</span></p>
