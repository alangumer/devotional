    <h1>Marvel of the Heavenly Hosts</h1>

      <p><strong>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
          likeness of men. Philippians 2:7.</strong></p>
      <p>It is important that we each study to know the reason of the life of Christ in humanity, and what it means to
          <nobr>us—why</nobr> the Son of God left the courts of <nobr>heaven—why</nobr> He stepped down from His
          position as commander of the heavenly angels who came and went at His <nobr>bidding—why</nobr> He clothed His
          divinity with humanity, and in lowliness and humility came to the world as our Redeemer.</p>
      <p>It was the marvel of the heavenly hosts that Christ should come to earth and do as He <nobr>did—that</nobr> His
          life here should be one of poverty, in such incomparable contrast with His glory in the heavenly courts. He
          might have come attended by the angelic throng....</p>
      <p>Before the universe of heaven, Christ condescended to take upon Him the form of humanity, and stand among the
          lowly ones of earth, that He might reach them where they were, and by precept and example teach them, that
          though among the poor and oppressed they might be pure, and true, and noble. He came to reveal to the world
          that the life and character need not become contaminated amid poverty and lowliness. The lily that rests upon
          the bosom of the lake may be surrounded with weeds and unsightly debris, yet, unsullied, it opens its fragrant
          white blossom to the sunlight. It strikes its channeled stem down through the mass of rubbish to the pure
          sands beneath. Refusing everything that would deﬁle, it gathers to itself only those properties that will
          develop into the spotless, fragrant ﬂower.</p>
      <p>The lily is a representation of Christ among men. He came to a world all seared and marred with the curse, but
          He was not polluted by His surroundings. He was the Light, the Life, and the Way. He voluntarily became an
          inhabitant of earth, that He might grasp the whole world in His merciful arms and lay it in the arms of His
          heavenly Father. What love is manifested in this sacriﬁce, that the Lord Himself should come to the help of
          the fallen sons and daughters of Adam!<span class="ft11">59</span></p>
