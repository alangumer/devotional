    <h1>The Wilderness Temptation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. Matthew
          4:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Why was it that at the beginning of His public ministry Christ was led into the wilderness to be tempted?</p>
      <p>... He went, not in His own behalf, but in our behalf; to overcome for us.... He was to be tried and tested as
          a</p>
      <p>representative of the race. He was to meet the foe in personal encounter, to overthrow him who claimed to be
          the head of the kingdoms of the world.<span class="ft15">52</span></p>
      <p>Satan met Him and tempted Him on the very points where man will be tempted. Our Substitute and Surety passed
          over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell. And the question was, Will He stumble and fall as Adam did over
          God’s commandments? He met Satan’s attacks again and again with “It is written,” and Satan left the ﬁeld of
          conﬂict a conquered foe. Christ has redeemed Adam’s disgraceful fall, and has perfected a character of perfect
          obedience, and left an example for the human family.... Had He failed on one point in reference to the</p>
      <p>law of God, He would not have been a perfect offering, for it was on one point only that Adam failed....</p>
      <p>Our Saviour withstood on every point the test of temptation, and in this way He has made it possible for man to
          overcome. Now, there is enough in this idea, in this thought, to ﬁll our hearts with gratitude every day of
          our lives. As Jesus was accepted as our substitute and surety, every one of us will be accepted if we stand
          the test and trial for ourselves. He took our nature that He might become acquainted with the trials wherewith
          man should be beset, and He is our mediator and intercessor before the Father.<span

      <p>Those who would overcome must put to the tax every power of their being. They must agonize on their knees
          before God for divine power.... Men may have a power to resist <nobr>evil—a</nobr> power that neither earth,
          nor</p>
      <p>death, nor hell can master; a power that will place them where they may overcome as Christ overcame. Divinity
          and humanity may be combined in them.<span class="ft15">54</span></p>
