    <h1>A Day of Reckoning</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not
          shall be taken away even that which he hath. Matthew 25:29.</strong></p>
      <p>If talents are well improved, increased talents are the result. “Unto every one that hath shall be given.”
          ...</p>
      <p>If Heaven’s bestowed gifts are not appreciated and improved as God’s intrusted <nobr>capital—if</nobr> they are
          buried in worldliness, in <nobr>selﬁshness—these</nobr> powers capable of blessing humanity decrease, and
          because the God of heaven is not sought after and gloriﬁed as the source of all these precious endowments, He
          is dishonored, and He cuts off the supply. In order to increase, to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and
          Saviour Jesus Christ, we must put to use by human effort our physical and intellectual powers.<span
          class="ft17">20</span></p>
      <p>Those who hoard up their talents to rust, unemployed, unimproved, must not think that such action in any way
          relieves them from responsibility, for God holds us responsible for the good we might do if we took up the
          yoke with Christ, lifting His burdens, learning more of His meekness and lowliness of heart day by day. The
          interest continues to accumulate on buried talents, and instead of decreasing our responsibility the burying
          of our talent only increases and intensiﬁes it.</p>
      <p>Let the human agent consider the solemn fact that the day of reckoning is just before us, and that we are daily
          deciding what our eternal destiny shall be. The Master examines every individual case, dealing personally with
          the talents entrusted by Him. O solemn day of reckoning; that day which will bring paleness to many faces;
          that day in which the words shall be spoken to many, “Thou art weighed in the balances, and found wanting”! It
          will be an awful thing to be found “wanting” when the book of accounts is opened in that great day....
          Upon</p>
      <p>the decisions reached in that day depends the future, eternal interest of every soul. We shall have unspeakable
          joy, or unutterable woe and misery.... O how Jesus will love to recompense every true worker! Every
          faithfully</p>
      <p>performed duty will receive His blessing. It is then that He pronounces the benediction, “Well done.”<span
