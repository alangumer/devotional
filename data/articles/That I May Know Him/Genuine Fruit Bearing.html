    <h1>Genuine Fruit Bearing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
          fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. John 15:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Said Christ, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.” “I am the vine, ye are the branches.”
          “Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it,
          that it may bring forth more fruit” (John 15:1, 5, 2). That unpruned branch may have looked good to human eyes
          but the eye of One who never slumbers nor sleeps leaves it not alone to die of discouragement. The Husbandman
          pruneth it, that it may produce fruit unto life eternal....</p>
      <p>Whenever professed Christians are constantly ﬂaunting their leaves of profession before the eyes of others,
          there is no real fruit to the glory of God. Their religious life and experience seem satisfactory to
          themselves. They have exaggerated emotions, effusive expressions of fervor, and highest exaltations. Their
          religion consists largely in feeling and excitement. There is very little in their own souls that corresponds
          to their profession of faith. Self is their ideal of perfection. They value more the outward impression they
          make upon others than the inner life which is hidden with Christ in God.</p>
      <p>Let everyone who would reveal Christ by being a doer of His Word, become rooted in Christ Jesus, rooted and
          grounded in the truth. Put away all <nobr>self-assertion.</nobr> Let living and acting the lessons of Christ
          Jesus speak of your perfect obedience to Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>The formation of the character must go on day by day, hour by hour. The inward working of the Holy Spirit is
          revealed outwardly in the appearance of fruit, ripening and perfecting to the glory of God. The inward life
          speaks in the outward action, in the producing of rich fruit. This is showing forth the praises of Him who
          hath called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. If the Lord Jesus is formed within, the hope of
          glory, the life will be rich in good works, corresponding with the truth which they profess to believe.<span
