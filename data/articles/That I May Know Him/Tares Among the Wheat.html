    <h1>Tares Among the Wheat</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather
          ye together ﬁrst the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. Matthew
          13:30.</strong></p>
      <p>In this world we shall become hopelessly perplexed (as the devil wants us to be) if we keep looking upon those
          things that are perplexing, for by dwelling upon them, and talking of them, we become discouraged.... We</p>
      <p>may create an unreal world in our own mind or picture an ideal church, where the temptations of Satan no longer
          prompt to evil, but perfection exists only in our imagination. The world is a fallen world, and the church is
          a place represented by a ﬁeld in which grow tares and wheat. They are to grow together until the harvest. It
          is not our place to uproot the tares, according to human wisdom, lest under the suggestions of Satan the wheat
          may be rooted up under the supposition that it is tares. The wisdom that is from above will come to him who is
          meek and lowly in heart, and that wisdom will not lead him to destroy, but to build up the people of
          God....</p>
      <p>None need to err, none need to lose the golden moments of time in their short life history through seeking to
          weigh the imperfections of professed Christians. Not one of us has time to do this. If we know what is the
          manner of character Christians should develop, and yet see in others that which is inconsistent with this
          character, let us determine that we will ﬁrmly resist the enemy in his temptations to make us act in an
          inconsistent way, and say, “I will not make Christ ashamed of me. I will more earnestly study the character of
          Christ in whom there was no imperfection, no selﬁshness, no spot, no stain of evil, who lived not to please
          and glorify Himself, but to glorify God and save fallen humanity. I will not copy the defective characters of
          these inconsistent Christians; the mistakes that they have made shall not lead me to be like them. I will turn
          to the precious Saviour, that I may be like Him, follow the instruction of the Word of God, which says, ‘Let
          this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus”’ (Philippians 2:5).<span class="ft17">30</span></p>
