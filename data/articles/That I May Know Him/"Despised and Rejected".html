    <h1>“Despised and Rejected”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were
          our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Isaiah 53:3.</strong></p>
      <p>How few have any conception of the anguish which rent the heart of the Son of God during His thirty years of
          life upon earth. The path from the manger to Calvary was shadowed by sorrow and grief. He was the Man of
          Sorrows, and endured such heartache as no human language can portray. He could have said in truth, “Behold,
          and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow” (Lamentations 1:12). His suffering was the deepest anguish
          of the soul; and what man could have sympathy with the soul anguish of the Son of the inﬁnite God? Hating sin
          with a perfect hatred, He yet gathered to His soul the sins of the whole world, as He trod the path to
          Calvary, suffering the penalty of the transgressor. Guiltless, He bore the punishment of the guilty; innocent,
          yet offering Himself to bear the penalty of the transgression of the law of God. The punishment of the sins of
          every soul was borne by the Son of the inﬁnite God. The guilt of every sin pressed its weight upon the divine
          soul of the world’s Redeemer. He who knew no sin became sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of
          God in Him. In assuming the nature of man, He placed Himself where He was wounded for our transgressions,
          bruised for our iniquities, that by His stripes we might be healed.</p>
      <p>In His humanity Christ was tried with as much greater temptation, with as much more persevering energy than man
          is tried by the evil one, as His nature was greater than man’s. This is a deep mysterious truth, that Christ
          is bound to humanity by the most sensitive sympathies. The evil works, the evil thoughts, the evil words of
          every son and daughter of Adam press upon His divine soul. The sins of men called for retribution upon
          Himself, for He had become man’s substitute, and took upon Him the sins of the world. He bore the sins of
          every sinner, for all transgressions were imputed unto Him.... “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great
          salvation?” (Hebrews</p>
      <p>2:3).<span class="ft15">1</span></p>
