    <h1>Crisis of the Ages</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he
          shall be saved out of it. Jeremiah 30:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The fulﬁlling of the signs of the times gives evidence that the day of the Lord is near at hand.... The
          crisis</p>
      <p>is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the heavens, passing over its usual round, and the heavens
          still declare the glory of God. Men are still eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying and giving
          in marriage. Merchants are still buying and selling.... Pleasure lovers are still crowding to theaters, horse
          races,</p>
      <p>gambling hells. The highest excitement prevails, yet probation’s hour is fast closing, and every case is about
          to be eternally decided. Satan sees that his time is short. He has set all his agents to work, that men may be
          deceived, deluded, occupied, and entranced until the day of probation shall be ended and the door of mercy be
          forever shut....</p>
      <p>The “time of trouble, such as never was” (Daniel 12:1) is soon to open upon us, and we shall need an experience
          which many are too indolent to obtain.... Now, while our great High Priest is making the atonement</p>
      <p>for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield
          to the power of temptation. Satan ﬁnds in human hearts some point where he can gain a foothold; some sinful
          desire is cherished, by means of which his temptations assert their power. But Christ declared of Himself,
          “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me” (John 14:30). Satan could ﬁnd nothing in the Son of
          God that would enable him to gain the victory. He had kept His Father’s commandments, and there was no sin in
          Him that Satan could use to his advantage. This is the condition in which those must be found who shall stand
          in the time of trouble.</p>
      <p>“Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: ... He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
          that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by
          sacriﬁce” (Psalm <nobr>50:3-5).<span class="ft11">17</span></nobr></p>
