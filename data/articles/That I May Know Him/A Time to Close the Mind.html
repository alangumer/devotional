    <h1>A Time to Close the Mind</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother,
          speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but
          a judge. James 4:11.</strong></p>
      <p>If Satan can employ professed believers to act as accusers of the brethren, he is greatly pleased, for those
          who do this are just as truly serving him as was Judas when he betrayed Christ, although they may be doing it
          ignorantly....</p>
      <p>Floating rumors are frequently the destroyers of unity among brethren. There are some who watch with open mind
          and ears to catch ﬂying scandal. They gather up little incidents which may be triﬂing in themselves, but which
          are repeated and exaggerated until a man is made an offender for a word. Their motto seems to be, “Report, and
          we will report it.”</p>
      <p>These talebearers are doing the devil’s work with surprising ﬁdelity, little knowing how offensive their course
          is to God. If they would spend half the energy and zeal that is given to this unholy work in examining their
          own hearts, they would ﬁnd so much to do to cleanse their souls from impurity that they would have no time or
          disposition to criticize their brethren, and they would not fall under the power of this temptation.</p>
      <p>The door of the mind should be closed against, “they say” or “I have heard.” Why should we not, instead of
          allowing jealousy or evil surmising to come into our hearts, go to our brethren, and, after frankly but kindly
          setting before them the things we have heard detrimental to their character and inﬂuence, pray with and for
          them?</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>Let us diligently cultivate the pure principles of the gospel of Christ, the religion, not of
          <nobr>self-esteem,</nobr> but of love, meekness, and lowliness of heart. Then we shall love our brethren and
          esteem them better than ourselves. Our minds will not dwell on the dark side of their character; we shall not
          feast on scandal and ﬂying reports. But “whatsoever things are ...of good report; if there be any virtue, and
          if there be any praise,” we shall “think on these things” (Philippians 4:8).<span class="ft11">37</span></p>
