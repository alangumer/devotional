    <h1>From Defeat to Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. James
          5:16.</strong></p>
      <p>All are liable to err, therefore the Word of God tells us plainly how to correct and heal these mistakes. None
          can say that he never makes a mistake, that he never sinned at all, but it is important to consider what
          disposition you make of these wrongs. The apostle Paul made grievous mistakes, all the time thinking that he
          was doing God service, but when the Spirit of the Lord set the matter before him in its true light, he
          confessed his wrongdoing, and afterward acknowledged the great mercy of God in forgiving his transgression.
          You also may have done wrong, thinking you were perfectly right, but when time reveals your error, then it is
          your duty to humble the heart and confess your sin....</p>
      <p>Whatever the character of your sin, confess it. If it is against God only, confess only to Him. If you have
          wronged or offended others, confess also to them, and the blessing of the Lord will rest upon you. In this way
          you die to self, and Christ is formed within....</p>
      <p>When, under the temptations of Satan, men fall into error, and their words and deportment are not Christlike,
          they may not realize their condition, because sin is deceptive and tends to deaden the moral perceptions. But
          through <nobr>self-examination,</nobr> searching of the Scriptures, and humble prayer, they will, by the aid
          of the Holy Spirit, be enabled to see their mistake. If they then confess their sins and turn from them, the
          tempter will not appear to them as an angel of light, but as a deceiver....</p>
      <p>Those who acknowledge reproof and correction as from God, and are thus enabled to see and correct their errors,
          are learning precious lessons, even from their mistakes. Their apparent defeat is turned into victory. They
          stand, trusting not to their own strength, but to the strength of God. They have earnestness, zeal, and
          affection, united with humility and regulated by the precepts of Godâ€™s Word.... They walk not stumblingly, but
          safely, in a</p>
      <p>path where the light of heaven shines.<span class="ft15">31</span></p>
