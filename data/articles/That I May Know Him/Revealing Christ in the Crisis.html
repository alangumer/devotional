    <h1>Revealing Christ in the Crisis</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power
          unto his people. Blessed be God. Psalm 68:35.</strong></p>
      <p>It is time we were endowed with power from on high. Satan and all his confederacy of evil are working with
          untiring vigilance to oppose good. Never was there a stronger combination formed to neutralize the lessons and
          teachings of Christ and to sow the seeds of inﬁdelity in regard to the inspiration of the Scriptures....</p>
      <p>Satan is moving with his power from beneath to inspire men to form alliances and confederacies of evil against
          light and against the Word of God. Inﬁdelity, papacy, and <nobr>semi-papacy</nobr> are coming in close and
          powerful companionship with professed Christianity. The low views of inspiration, the exalting of human ideas
          from men called wise, are placing human talent above the divine wisdom and forms, and science
          <nobr>so-called</nobr> above the power of vital godliness. These are the signs of the last days. Let every one
          who believes in Jesus Christ ... use his talent of voice in exalting Jesus and presenting testimonies that
          will magnify, honor, and adore the Word of God.... The</p>
      <p>gospel makes itself known in its power in the consistent, holy, pure lives of those who are believers, hearers,
          and doers of the Word.</p>
      <p>Do not give to the world the impression that Christ has proved to you without form and comeliness ... and that
          there is no beauty in Him that you should desire Him. Reveal Christ as He <nobr>is—the</nobr> one “altogether
          lovely” and the “chiefest among ten thousand” (Song of Solomon 5:16, 10). O how His glory is dimmed by His
          professed followers because they are <nobr>earthly-minded,</nobr> disobedient, unthankful, and unholy! How
          shamefully is the Lord Jesus kept in the background! How is His mercy, His forbearance, His
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> and His matchless love veiled, and His honor beclouded by the perversity of His
          professed followers! ... Lift up Jesus. Talk of His love, tell of His power, and let self be lost behind the
          glory of His person and the mighty power of the cross of Calvary.<span class="ft11">5</span></p>
