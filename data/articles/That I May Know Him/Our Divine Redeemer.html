      <p><strong>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Philippians
          2:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus Christ “counted it not a thing to be grasped to be equal with God.” Because divinity alone could be
          efﬁcacious in the restoration of man from the poisonous bruise of the serpent, God Himself, in His only
          begotten Son, assumed human nature, and in the weakness of human nature sustained the character of God,
          vindicated His holy law in every particular, and accepted the sentence of wrath and death for the sons of men.
          What a thought is this! He who was one with the Father before the world was made had such compassion for a
          world lost and ruined by transgression that He gave His life a ransom for it. He who was the brightness of the
          Father’s glory, the express image of His person, bore our sins in His own body on the tree, suffering the
          penalty of man’s transgression until justice was satisﬁed and required no more. How great is the redemption
          that has been worked out for us! So great that the Son of God died the cruel death of the cross to bring to us
          life and immortality through faith in Him.</p>
      <p>This wonderful <nobr>problem—how</nobr> God could be just and yet the justiﬁer of <nobr>sinners—is</nobr>
          beyond human ken. As we attempt to fathom it, it broadens and deepens beyond our comprehension. When we look
          with the eye of faith upon the cross of Calvary, and see our sins laid upon the victim hanging in weakness and
          ignominy <nobr>there—when</nobr> we grasp the fact that this is God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
          <nobr>Peace—we</nobr> are led to exclaim, “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us” (1
          John 3:1)! ...</p>
      <p>When man can measure the exalted character of the Lord of hosts, and distinguish between the eternal God and
          ﬁnite humanity, he will know how great has been the sacriﬁce of Heaven to bring man from where he has fallen
          through disobedience to become part of the family of God.... The divinity of Christ is our assurance of</p>
      <p>eternal life.... He, the Sin Bearer of the world, is our only medium of reconciliation with a holy God.<span
