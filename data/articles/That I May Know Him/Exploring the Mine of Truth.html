    <h1>Exploring the Mine of Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved
          by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter 1:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Some have neglected the Bible under the erroneous impression that the indwelling of the Spirit was preferable
          to the study and guidance of the Scriptures. Such will be exposed to Satan’s snares and fatal delusions. The
          Holy Spirit and the Word are in perfect harmony. The Holy Spirit inspired the Scriptures and always leads to
          the Scriptures....</p>
      <p>Everything in the religious world is to be tried by the Scriptures. “To the law and to the testimony: if they
          speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20). The claimed
          enlightenment of the Spirit within is to be tested and tried by the Word of God, which is the detector of the
          pure wheat....</p>
      <p>The mine of truth is to be explored interestedly, diligently. How often we ﬁnd Christ applying the Old
          Testament Scriptures, expounding their truths, showing their spiritual character, clothing them with freshness
          and richness and beauty the people had never beheld before.... The truths our Saviour reveals in His
          exposition</p>
      <p>are capable of constant expansion and new and richer developments. While searching the Scriptures, the mind
          that is led by the Holy Spirit sees their Author, and by beholding is constantly brightening while looking at
          the Word. Thus the intellect aspiring to reach the standard of perfection becomes elevated to comprehend
          it....</p>
      <p>The truth of heavenly origin is represented as “treasure hid in a ﬁeld; the which when a man hath found, he
          hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that ﬁeld” (Matthew 13:44) that he
          may work every part of it. In his persevering efforts he discovers concealed jewels and precious ore. He who
          labors wisely sinks the shaft deeper and deeper and discovers a rich and precious lode. He ﬁnds that the ﬁeld
          of revelation is interlaced with golden veins of precious treasures and is indeed the storehouse of the
          unsearchable riches of <nobr>Christ—light,</nobr> truth, and life.<span class="ft11">11</span></p>
