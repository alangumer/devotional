    <h1>Justiﬁed by Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore being justiﬁed by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also
          we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1,
          2.</strong></p>
      <p>When God pardons the sinner, remits the punishment he deserves, and treats him as though he had not sinned, He
          receives him into divine favor, and justiﬁes him through the merits of Christ’s righteousness. The sinner can
          be justiﬁed only through faith in the atonement made through God’s dear Son, who became a sacriﬁce for the
          sins of the guilty world. No one can be justiﬁed by any works of his own. He can be delivered from the guilt
          of sin, from the condemnation of the law, from the penalty of transgression, only by virtue of the suffering,
          death, and resurrection of Christ. Faith is the only condition upon which justiﬁcation can be obtained, and
          faith includes not only belief but trust....</p>
      <p>The sinner is represented as a lost sheep, and a lost sheep never returns to the fold unless he is sought after
          and brought back to the fold by the shepherd. No man of himself can repent, and make himself worthy of the
          blessing of justiﬁcation. The Lord Jesus is constantly seeking to impress the sinner’s mind and attract him to
          behold Himself, the Lamb of God.... We cannot take a step toward spiritual life save as Jesus draws and</p>
      <p>strengthens the soul, and leads us to experience that repentance which needeth not to be repented of....</p>
      <p>The faith that is unto salvation is not a casual faith, it is not the mere consent of the intellect, it is
          belief rooted in the heart, that embraces Christ as a personal Saviour.... When the soul lays hold upon Christ
          as the only</p>
      <p>hope of salvation, then genuine faith is manifested. This faith leads its possessor to place all the affections
          of the soul upon Christ; his understanding is under the control of the Holy Spirit, and his character is
          molded after the divine likeness. His faith is not a dead faith, but a faith that works by love, and leads him
          to behold the beauty of Christ, and to become assimilated to the divine character.<span
