    <h1>“With Joy Unspeakable”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
          unspeakable and full of glory. 1 Peter 1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>He [Christ] says, “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s
          commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and
          that your joy might be full” (John 15:10, 11). In Him there is joy that is not uncertain and unsatisfying. If
          the light that ﬂows from Jesus has come to you, and you are reﬂecting it upon others, you show that you have
          joy that is pure, elevating, and ennobling. Why should not the religion of Christ be represented as it really
          is, as full of attractiveness and power? Why should we not present before the world the loveliness of Christ?
          Why do we not show that we have a living Saviour, one who can walk with us in the darkness as well as in the
          light, and that we can trust in Him? ...</p>
      <p>But minds that are occupied with frivolous reading, with exciting stories, or with seeking after amusement, do
          not dwell upon Christ, and cannot rejoice in the fullness of His love. The mind that ﬁnds pleasure in foolish
          thoughts and triﬂing conversation is as destitute of the joy of Christ as were the hills of Gilboa of dew or
          rain....</p>
      <p>We need to be constantly ﬁlling the mind with Christ, and emptying it of selﬁshness and sin.<span

      <p>The life in which the fear of the Lord is cherished will not be a life of sadness and gloom. It is the absence
          of Christ that makes the countenance sad and the life a pilgrimage of sighs.... But Christ dwelling in the
          soul is</p>
      <p>a wellspring of joy. For all who receive Him, the keynote of the Word of God is “rejoicing.”</p>
      <p>Why should not our joy be <nobr>full—full,</nobr> lacking nothing? We have the assurance that Jesus is our
          Saviour, and that we may freely partake of the rich provision He has made for us.... It is our privilege to
          seek constantly the</p>
      <p>joy of His presence. He desires us to be cheerful and to be ﬁlled with praise to His name. He wants us to carry
          light in our countenances and joy in our hearts.<span class="ft15">21</span></p>
