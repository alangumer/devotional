    <h1>The Greatest Teacher</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that
          is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
          1 John 5:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The world’s Redeemer did not come with outward display, or a show of worldly wisdom. Men could not see beneath
          the disguise of humility the glory of the Son of God....</p>
      <p>Christ reached the people where they were. He presented the plain truth to their minds in the most forcible and
          simple language. The humble poor, the most unlearned, could comprehend, through faith in Him, the most exalted
          truths of God. No one needed to consult the learned doctors as to His meaning. He did not perplex the ignorant
          with mysterious inferences, or use unaccustomed and learned words of which they had no knowledge. The greatest
          Teacher the world has ever known was the most deﬁnite, simple, and practical in His instruction....</p>
      <p>He attracted attention to purity of life, to humility of spirit, and to devotion to God and His cause without
          hope of worldly honor or reward. He must divest religion of the narrow, conceited formalism which made it a
          burden and a reproach. He must present a complete, harmonious salvation to all. The narrow bounds of national
          exclusiveness must be overthrown, for His salvation was to reach the ends of the earth. He rejoiced in spirit
          as He beheld the poor of this world eagerly accepting the precious message which He brought. He looked up to
          heaven and said, “I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from
          the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes” (Matthew 11:25)....</p>
      <p>Men of the highest education and accomplishments have learned the most precious lessons from the precept and
          example of the humble follower of Christ, who is designated as “unlearned” by the world. But could men look
          with deeper insight they would see that these humble men had obtained an education in the highest of all
          schools, even in the school of the divine Teacher, who spake as never man spake.<span
