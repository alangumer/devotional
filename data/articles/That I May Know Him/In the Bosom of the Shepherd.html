    <h1>In the Bosom of the Shepherd</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall feed his ﬂock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry them in his
          bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. Isaiah 40:11.</strong></p>
      <p>A true shepherd knows and pities and helps the sheep that most need his <nobr>help—those</nobr> that are
          bruised and lame and feeble. “He shall feed his ﬂock like a shepherd.”</p>
      <p>Far more intimately than the patriarch Jacob knew the weak, the suffering, and the lame among his sheep, does
          the Chief Shepherd know His ﬂock. He knows what no one else knows. He has Himself weighed every burden. No one
          knows the weight like Himself, for He has borne all our griefs, and carried all our sorrows. It was this that
          made Him a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief....</p>
      <p>If there is not another soul in the universe that regards you, the Lord God of Israel is looking upon you with
          thoughts of compassion, tenderness, and sympathy. He sees you with your strong impulses when fainthearted and
          discouraged.... You have the deepest, the richest, the most refreshing sympathy in the bosom of the great</p>
      <p>Shepherd. We have not an high priest who cannot sympathize with us, but One who was in all points tempted like
          as we are, yet without sin....</p>
      <p>Not only has every provision been made that when tried and tempted you should ﬁnd help and strength and grace,
          but also that your inﬂuence upon other minds should be fragrant. Not only does Christ know every soul, and the
          temptations and trials of that soul, but He knows all the circumstances that irritate and chafe the spirit.
          Your great danger is in being <nobr>self-sufﬁcient.</nobr> This will not do for a Christian. Christ will give
          you His patience if you ask for it....</p>
      <p>God’s abounding love and presence will give you the power of <nobr>self-control.</nobr> He will mold and
          fashion your mind and character. He will direct your aims and purposes and capabilities in a channel that will
          give you moral and spiritual power which you will not have to leave here in this world but can carry with you
          and retain through eternal ages.<span class="ft11">20</span></p>
