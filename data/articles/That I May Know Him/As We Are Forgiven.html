    <h1>As We Are Forgiven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. Matthew 6:12.</strong></p>
      <p>It is most difﬁcult, even for those who claim to be followers of Jesus, to forgive as Christ forgives us. The
          true spirit of forgiveness is so little practiced, and so many interpretations are placed upon Christ’s
          requirement, that its force and beauty are lost sight of. We have very uncertain views of the great mercy and
          <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> of God. He is full of compassion and forgiveness, and freely pardons when we
          truly repent and confess our sins....</p>
      <p>Peter, when brought to the test, sinned greatly. In denying the Master he had loved and served, he became a
          cowardly apostate. But his Lord did not cast him off; He freely forgave him.... Henceforth, remembering
          his</p>
      <p>own weakness and failures, he would be patient with his brethren in their mistakes and errors. Remembering the
          patient love of Christ toward him, affording him another opportunity to bring forth the fruit of good works,
          he would be more conciliatory toward erring ones....</p>
      <p>The Lord requires of us the same treatment toward His followers that we receive of Him. We are to exercise
          patience, to be kind even though they do not meet our expectations in every particular.... The last</p>
      <p>six commandments specify man’s duty to man. Christ did not say, You may tolerate your neighbor, but, “Thou
          shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” ...</p>
      <p>The love of Jesus needs to be brought to bear upon our lives. It will have a softening, subduing inﬂuence upon
          our hearts and characters. It will prompt us to forgive our brethren even though they have done us injury.
          Divine love must ﬂow from our hearts in gentle words and kindly actions to one another. The fruit of these
          good works will hang as rich clusters upon the vine of character....</p>
      <p>Rejoicing in Christ as your Saviour, pitiful, compassionate, and touched with the feeling of your inﬁrmities,
          love and joy will be revealed in your daily life. If you love Him who died to redeem mankind you will love
          those for whom He died.<span class="ft11">31</span></p>
