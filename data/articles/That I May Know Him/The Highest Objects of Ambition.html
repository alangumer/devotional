    <h1>The Highest Objects of Ambition</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which
          the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. John 6:27.</strong></p>
      <p>We cannot tell the ambitious man that he must cease to be ambitious if he would become a Christian. God places
          before him the highest objects of <nobr>ambition—a</nobr> spotless white robe, a crown studded with jewels, a
          scepter, a throne of glory, and honor that is as enduring as the throne of Jehovah. All the elements of
          character which help to make him successful and honored in the <nobr>world—the</nobr> irrepressible desire for
          some greater good, the indomitable will, the strenuous exertion, the untiring <nobr>perseverance—are</nobr>
          not to be crushed out. These are to remain, and through the grace of God received into the heart to be turned
          into another channel. These valuable traits of character may be exercised on objects as much higher and nobler
          than worldly pursuits as the heavens are higher than the earth.</p>
      <p>Jesus presents a white robe, a crown of glory richer than any that ever decked the brow of a monarch, and
          titles above those of honored princes. The recompense for a life devoted to the service of Christ exceeds
          anything that the human imagination can grasp. Christ does not call upon men to lay aside their zeal, their
          desires for excellence and elevation, but He would have them seek, not for perishable treasure or ﬂeeting
          honor, but for that which is enduring....</p>
      <p>God is well pleased if those striving for eternal life aim high. There will be strong temptations to indulge
          the natural traits of character by becoming worldly wise, scheming, and selﬁshly ambitious, gathering wealth
          to the neglect of the salvation which is of so much higher value. But every temptation resisted is a priceless
          victory gained in subduing self; it bends the powers to the service of Jesus, and increases faith, hope,
          patience, and forbearance.... Let us aim in the strength of Jesus for the crown heavy with stars. “They that
          be wise shall shine</p>
      <p>as ... the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever” (Daniel
          12:3).<span class="ft15">34</span></p>
