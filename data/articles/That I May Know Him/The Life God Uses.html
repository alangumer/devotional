    <h1>The Life God Uses</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea,
          I have made him. Isaiah 43:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Our life is the Lord’s, and is invested with a responsibility that we do not fully comprehend. The threads of
          self have become woven into the fabric, and this has dishonored God.</p>
      <p>Nehemiah, after gaining so great an inﬂuence over the monarch in whose court he lived and over his people in
          Jerusalem, instead of ascribing praise to his own excellent traits of character, his remarkable aptness and
          energy, stated the matter just as it was. He declared that his success was due to the good hand of God that
          was upon him. He cherished the truth that God was his safeguard in every position of inﬂuence. For every trait
          of character by which he obtained favor he praised the working power of God....</p>
      <p>We need to sense deeply that all inﬂuence is a precious talent to be used for God.... We need to
          appreciate</p>
      <p>every capability we possess, because it is lent capital, to be improved to God’s glory.... There is
          constant</p>
      <p>temptation for human beings to consider that any inﬂuence they have gained is the result of something valuable
          in themselves. The Lord does not work with these, for He will not give to any human being the glory that
          belongs to His own name.... He makes the humble, trustful servant His <nobr>representative—the</nobr> one who
          will not lift himself</p>
      <p>up and think of himself more highly than he ought to think. The life of such a one will be dedicated to God as
          a living sacriﬁce, and that life He will accept and use and sustain. He longs to make men wise with His own
          wisdom, that that wisdom may be exercised in His own behalf. He manifests Himself through the consecrated
          humble worker....</p>
      <p>Carry every entrusted capability as a sacred treasure, to be used in imparting to others the knowledge and
          grace received. In this you will answer the purpose for which God gave them. The Lord requires us to sink self
          in Jesus Christ, and let the glory be all of God.<span class="ft11">30</span></p>
