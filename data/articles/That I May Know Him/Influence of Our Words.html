    <h1>Inﬂuence of Our Words</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and
          the Father by him. Colossians 3:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Men are greatly under the inﬂuence of their own words. You are not conscious how much you are affected by your
          words. You accustom yourself to speak in a certain way, and your thoughts and actions follow your words. One
          accustoms himself to assert certain things in regard to himself, and at last he comes to believe them. Our
          thoughts produce our words and our words react upon our thoughts. If a man forms the habit of using sacred
          words reverently, he will form the custom of carefulness of speech, knowing that there is a Witness to every
          word uttered. When the feelings become excited and the speech is exaggerated, the mode of speaking is always
          extreme. It acts and reacts upon ourselves.</p>
      <p>The Word declares, “By thy words thou shalt be justiﬁed, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned” (Matthew
          12:37). If our words act upon ourselves they act more powerfully upon others. There is great mischief done by
          words spoken. God alone knows and measures the result of a careless, exaggerated mode of speaking. There is
          much swearing done in spirit....</p>
      <p>You are reproducing your own character in others. You may express many things that will create in other minds a
          course of thought which will lead them into false paths. God may spare you to outlive your exasperated
          feelings and come to have sensible thoughts. You may outlive your doubts, and through repentance toward God
          and faith in Jesus Christ escape from the snare of the fowler. You may pass into the sunshine of faith, but
          oh, you may never be conscious ... that these words are doing their mischievous work in the soil of the hearts
          of others, and poisoning it. Here is a harvest some must reap....</p>
      <p>Raise the standard for Christ Jesus and have all your words select, seasoned with salt. Cultivate true
          dignity....</p>
      <p>Let your words feel the inﬂuence of the converting power of God. Let wholesome words be spoken.<span
