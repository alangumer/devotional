    <h1>Those First Dangerous Steps</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the
          living God. Hebrews 3:12.</strong></p>
      <p>When the Redeemer of the world walked among men, many who identiﬁed themselves with Him as His disciples
          afterward forsook Him and became His bitterest enemies. The Saviour tested their faith and developed the real
          characters of the most ardent believers by applying spiritual truths to their hearts....</p>
      <p>They must be Christlike, meek and lowly of heart, <nobr>self-denying,</nobr><nobr>self-sacriﬁcing;</nobr> they
          must walk in the narrow path trodden by the Man of Calvary if they would share in the gift of life and the
          glory of heaven. But the test was too great. They walked no more with Him. They could not hear the saying nor
          comprehend the nature of the truth He taught....</p>
      <p>The work of apostasy begins in some secret rebellion of the heart against the requirements of God’s law. Unholy
          desires, unlawful ambitions, are cherished and indulged, and unbelief and darkness separate the soul from God.
          If we do not overcome these evils, they will overcome us. Men who have long been advancing in the path of
          truth will be tested with trial and temptation. Those who listen to the suggestions of Satan and swerve from
          their integrity begin the downward path, and some masterful temptation hastens them on in the way of apostasy,
          till their descent is marked and rapid....</p>
      <p>We need to be constantly on our guard, to watch and pray lest we enter into temptation. The indulgence of
          spiritual pride, of unholy desires, of evil thoughts, of anything that separates us from an intimate and
          sacred association with Jesus imperils our souls.... If the thought of apostasy is grievous to you, and you do
          not desire</p>
      <p>to become the enemies of the truth, the accusers of the brethren, then “abhor that which is evil; cleave to
          that which is good” (Romans 12:9), and believe in Him who is “able to keep you from falling, and to present
          you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy” (Jude 24).<span class="ft11">5</span></p>
