    <h1>Daily Self-denial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
          sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Romans 12:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Why will not the youth learn a lesson from the case of Adam? His failure in not bearing the slight test of God
          was followed by a terrible retribution. And yet Satan has such power to bewitch the mind that with this beacon
          of warning before us many will talk of liberality and not being so particular in regard to God’s
          requirements....</p>
      <p>It is a very small offering, at best, that we can make to our heavenly Father. In view of our accountability to
          God, we are all under the strongest obligation to bring our appetites and passions under the control of the
          intelligent will. Taste has done more to pervert the understanding and becloud the spiritual sky than
          everything else beside. Satan benumbs the intellect of many through indulgence of appetite, and then he makes
          these intemperate ones special objects of temptation, to go still farther from the path of obedience and
          holiness. Those who have been entrusted with valuable talents will miss eternal life unless they shall see the
          necessity of daily <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> of what it means to be an overcomer....</p>
      <p>There is not, with many, ... one half the vigor there might be, because of ailments brought on through
          indulgence of appetite and debasing habits. What clearness of perception the youth might have if they would
          adhere strictly to the laws of health, as did Daniel and his three companions! What freedom from pain, and
          with how much greater ease could they perform their duties! How much greater would be their spiritual fervor!
          And how much more good, by precept and example, would they do to others! ...</p>
      <p>God is able to make all grace abound toward you. We have no right to claim the promises of God till we comply
          with the conditions revealed in His Word. “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and
          touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you” (2 Corinthians 6:17). Will you do it?<span
