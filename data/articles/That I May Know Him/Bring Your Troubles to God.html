    <h1>Bring Your Troubles to God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of
          your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
          wanting nothing. James <nobr>1:2-4.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Word does not say that we are to count it all joy when we fall under temptation, but when we fall into
          temptation. It is not necessary to fall under temptation, for temptation comes upon us for the trying of our
          faith. And the trying of our faith worketh patience, not fretfulness and murmuring. If we put our trust in
          Jesus, He will keep us at all times, and will be our strength and shield. We are to learn valuable lessons
          from our trials. Paul says, “We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and
          patience, experience; and experience, hope ...” (Romans <nobr>5:3-5).</nobr></p>
      <p>Many seem to think that it is impossible not to fall under temptation, that they have no power to overcome, and
          they sin against God with their lips, talking discouragement and doubt instead of faith and courage. Christ
          was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. He said, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath
          nothing in me” (John 14:30). What does this mean? It means that the prince of evil could ﬁnd no vantage ground
          in Christ for his temptation. And so it may be with us....</p>
      <p>When we talk discouragement and gloom Satan listens with ﬁendish joy, for it pleases him to know that he has
          brought us into his bondage. Satan cannot read our thoughts, but he can see our actions, hear our words, and
          from his long knowledge of the human family he can shape his temptations to take advantage of our weak points
          of character. And how often do we let him into the secret of how he may obtain the victory over us!<span
          class="ft19">39</span></p>
      <p>We must learn to come to God in any and every emergency, as a child would come to its parents.... Don’t</p>
      <p>go to others with your trials and temptations; God alone can help you. If you fulﬁll the conditions of God’s
          promises, the promises will be fulﬁlled to you....You will have an anchor to the soul both sure and
          steadfast.<span class="ft17">40</span></p>
