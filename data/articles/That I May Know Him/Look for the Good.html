    <h1>Look for the Good</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are
          just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there
          be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Philippians 4:8.</strong></p>
      <p>We are a part of the great web of humanity. We become changed into the image of that upon which we dwell. Then
          how important to open our hearts to the things that are true and lovely and of good report. Let into the heart
          the light of the Sun of Righteousness. Do not cherish one root of bitterness.<span class="ft11">33</span></p>
      <p>Christ was inﬁnite in wisdom and yet He thought best to accept Judas, although He knew what were his
          imperfections of character. John was not perfect; Peter denied his Lord; and yet it was of men like these that
          the early Christian church was organized. Jesus accepted them that they might learn of Him what constitutes a
          perfect Christian character. The business of every Christian is to study the character of Christ....</p>
      <p>Judas alone did not respond to divine enlightenment.... He braced his soul to resist the inﬂuence of the</p>
      <p>truth; and while he practiced criticising and condemning others, he neglected his own soul, and cherished and
          strengthened his natural evil traits of character until he became so hardened that he could sell his Lord for
          thirty pieces of silver.</p>
      <p>O let us encourage our souls to look to Jesus! ...</p>
      <p>It is not an uncommon thing to see imperfection in those who carry on God’s work.... Would it not be</p>
      <p>more pleasing to God to take an impartial outlook, and see how many souls are serving God and glorifying and
          honoring Him with their talents of means and intellect? Would it not be better to consider the wonderful,
          <nobr>miracle-working</nobr> power of God in the transformation of poor degraded sinners...? The most
          unfavorable matters</p>
      <p>... should not cause us to feel perplexed and discouraged. Everything that causes us to see the weakness of
          humanity is in the Lord’s purpose to help us to look to Him, and in no case put our trust in man, or make ﬂesh
          our arm.<span class="ft11">34</span></p>
