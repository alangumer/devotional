    <h1>The Best Speciﬁcation We Can Have</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
          Christ. Titus 2:13.</strong></p>
      <p>We are Adventists. We are looking for the appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and we love to think
          about it. We know in whom we have believed, and are not afraid to commit the keeping of our souls unto Him
          against that day. We are not at all humiliated by confessing ourselves to be Adventists....</p>
      <p>We believe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment because it is written plainly and is the foundation of our
          religious faith. Let none of us be ashamed of this.... We accept not the authority of men’s councils, but we
          go</p>
      <p>further back, even to the councils of heaven. “For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.” (Psalm
          119:89). We take a “Thus saith the Lord.” Here we stand. A doctrine that has not a “Thus saith the Lord” may
          be accepted by the whole world, but that does not make it truth.... If we want to know the way to heaven we
          must study</p>
      <p>the Bible, not <nobr>man-made</nobr> theories or man’s suppositions.... We are not at all ashamed of our faith,
          <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr></p>
      <p>Adventism, for it is the very best speciﬁcation we can have. We are waiting for the second coming of our Lord
          and Saviour Jesus Christ. Men may scoff and ridicule our faith, but this should not provoke or surprise us.
          All these demonstrations do not make the truth error, neither do they make error truth. We take our stand
          ﬁrmly and unmovably upon the platform of the Word of God....</p>
      <p>Eternal realities must be kept before the mind’s eye, and the attractions of the world will appear as they
          <nobr>are—altogether</nobr> proﬁtless.... We are pilgrims and strangers who are waiting, hoping, and praying
          for that blessed</p>
      <p>hope, the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If we believe this and bring it into our
          practical life, what vigorous action would this faith and hope inspire; what fervent love one for another;
          what careful holy living for the glory of God; and ... what distinct lines of demarcation would be evidenced
          between us and the world!<span class="ft11">20</span></p>
