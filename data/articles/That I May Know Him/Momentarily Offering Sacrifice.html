    <h1>Momentarily Offering Sacriﬁce</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the
          right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Romans 8:34.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ Jesus is represented as continually standing at the altar, momentarily offering up the sacriﬁce for the
          sins of the world. He is a minister of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man.... A daily
          and</p>
      <p>yearly typical atonement is no longer to be made, but the atoning sacriﬁce through a mediator is essential
          because of the constant commission of sin. Jesus is ofﬁciating in the presence of God, offering up His shed
          blood, as it had been a lamb slain....</p>
      <p>Christ, our Mediator, and the Holy Spirit are constantly interceding in man’s behalf, but the Spirit pleads not
          for us as does Christ who presents His blood, shed from the foundation of the world; the Spirit works upon our
          hearts, drawing out prayers and penitence, praise and thanksgiving....</p>
      <p>The religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent confession of sin ascend from true believers as
          incense to the heavenly sanctuary; but passing through the corrupt channels of humanity, they are so deﬁled
          that unless puriﬁed by blood, they can never be of value with God. They ascend not in spotless purity, and
          unless the Intercessor who is at God’s right hand presents and puriﬁes all by His righteousness, it is not
          acceptable to God. All incense from earthly tabernacles must be moist with the cleansing drops of the blood of
          Christ. He holds before the Father the censer of His own merits, in which there is no taint of earthly
          corruption. He gathers into this censer the prayers, the praise, and the confessions of His people, and with
          these He puts His own spotless righteousness. Then, perfumed with the merits of Christ’s propitiation, the
          incense comes up before God wholly and entirely acceptable....</p>
      <p>O, that all may see that everything in obedience, in penitence, in praise and thanksgiving must be placed upon
          the glowing ﬁre of the righteousness of Christ. The fragrance of this righteousness ascends like a cloud
          around the mercy seat.<span class="ft11">14</span></p>
