    <h1>The Battle Against Intemperance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. Proverbs
          20:1.</strong></p>
      <p>We as Christians should stand ﬁrmly in defense of temperance. There is no class of persons capable of
          accomplishing more and effecting the object more readily than the <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> Bible youth. In
          this age the young men of our cities should unite in a ﬁrm, decided army to set their faces as a ﬂint against
          every form of selﬁsh, <nobr>health-destroying</nobr> indulgence. What a power they might be for good! How many
          they might save from becoming demoralized because they visit the halls and gardens ﬁtted up with music and
          every attraction to allure the youth! Intemperance and licentiousness and profanity are sisters. Let every
          <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> youth gird on the armor and press to the front. Put your names on every pledge....
          Let no feeble, weak excuse be offered to refuse</p>
      <p>to put your name to the temperance pledge....</p>
      <p>Through intemperate appetite Adam and Eve lost Eden. If we gain the Paradise of God we must be temperate in all
          things. Shall any blush with shame to refuse the wine cup or the foaming mug of beer? Instead of this being a
          dishonorable work, they are doing service to God in the matter of refusing to indulge appetite, resisting
          temptation. Angels are looking upon both tempter and tempted. While sin is unmanly, indulgence of appetite is
          weak, cowardly, and debasing; the denial of appetite, honorable. The highest intelligences of heaven watch the
          conﬂict going on between the tempter and the tempted. And if the tempted turn away from temptation and in the
          strength of Jesus conquer, then angels rejoice, and Satan has lost in the conﬂict.... All who understand
          the</p>
      <p>great conﬂict of Christ upon the point of appetite in the wilderness of temptation will never lend one iota of
          their inﬂuence to brace up intemperance.</p>
      <p>Jesus endured the painful fast in our behalf and conquered Satan in every temptation, thus making it possible
          for man to conquer in his own behalf, and on his own account, through the strength brought to him by this
          mighty victory gained as man’s substitute and surety.<span class="ft11">5</span></p>
