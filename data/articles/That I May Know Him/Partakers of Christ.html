    <h1>Partakers of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for
          ever: and the bread that I will give is my ﬂesh, which I will give for the life of the world. John
          6:51.</strong></p>
      <p>Bread cannot beneﬁt us unless we eat it, unless it becomes a part of our being. A knowledge of Christ will
          avail nothing unless we become like Him in character, bearing the same likeness, and representing His spirit
          to the world. Christ is of no value to us unless He is formed within, the hope of glory. If we do not know Him
          as our personal Saviour, a theoretical knowledge will do us no good. Water will not quench thirst unless we
          drink it. Bread will not satisfy hunger unless we eat it. If we are feeding spiritually upon Christ we are
          partakers of His nature, we are eating of His ﬂesh....</p>
      <p>When Christ uttered these words many of His disciples were in doubt as to what He meant, and He explained His
          words, saying: “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the ﬂesh proﬁteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you,
          they are spirit, and they are life” (John 6:63).</p>
      <p>If Christ is to you as a valuable treasure, if you ﬁnd in Him your greatest satisfaction, if He is prized and
          cherished above all others, if you regard everything else as loss that you may win Him, you are eating of His
          ﬂesh and drinking of His blood and are becoming conformed to His image. Those who hunger and thirst after
          righteousness will be ﬁlled. The invitation is: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
          that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
          Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisﬁeth not? ... eat
          ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness” (Isaiah 55:1, 2)....</p>
      <p>All heaven rejoices at the redemption of the lost race. Christ rejoiced in the secret consciousness of what He
          purposed to do for man. He desires to do far more abundantly than we are able to ask or think. The fountain of
          His inexpressible love is inexhaustible, and it ﬂows toward all those who believe in Him.<span
