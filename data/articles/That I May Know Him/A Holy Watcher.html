    <h1>A Holy Watcher</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened
          unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Hebrews 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>In every place, at every hour in the day, there is a holy Watcher who balances every account, whose eye takes
          in the whole situation, whether it is one of ﬁdelity or one of disloyalty and deception.</p>
      <p>We are never alone. We have a Companion whether we choose Him or not. Remember, young men and young women, that
          wherever you are, whatever you are doing, God is there. To your every word and action you have a
          <nobr>witness—the</nobr> holy, <nobr>sin-hating</nobr> God. Nothing that is said or done or thought can escape
          His inﬁnite eye. Your words may not be heard by human ears, but they are heard by the Ruler of the universe.
          He reads the inward anger of the soul when the will is crossed. He hears the expression of profanity. In the
          deepest darkness and solitude He is there. No one can deceive God; none can escape from their accountability
          to Him.</p>
      <p>“O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me,” writes the psalmist. “Thou knowest my downsitting and mine
          uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art
          acquainted with all my ways.... If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light
          about</p>
      <p>me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are
          both alike to thee” (Psalm <nobr>139:1-12).</nobr></p>
      <p>Day by day the record of your words, your actions, and your inﬂuence is being made in the books of heaven. This
          you must meet.<span class="ft15">21</span></p>
      <p>All heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God are ... marking the deeds of men. They record in
          the books of God’s remembrance the words of faith, the acts of love, the humility of spirit, and in that day
          when every man’s work shall be tried of what sort it is, the work of the humble follower of Christ will stand
          the test, and will receive the commendation of Heaven. “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the
          kingdom of their Father” (Matthew 13:43).<span class="ft11">22</span></p>
