      <p><strong>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that
          within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the
          order of Melchisedec. Hebrews 6:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>Hope has been set before us, even the hope of eternal life. Nothing short of this blessing for us will satisfy
          our Redeemer, but it is our part to lay hold upon this hope by faith in Him who has promised. We may expect to
          suffer, for it is those who are partakers with Him in His sufferings who shall be partakers with Him in His
          glory. He has purchased forgiveness and immortality for the sinful, perishing souls of men, but it is our part
          to receive these gifts by faith. Believing in Him, we have this hope as an anchor of the soul, sure and
          steadfast. We are to understand that we may conﬁdently expect God’s favor not only in this world but in the
          heavenly world, since He paid such a price for our salvation. Faith in the atonement and intercession of
          Christ will keep us steadfast and immovable amid the temptations that press upon us in the church militant.
          Let us contemplate the glorious hope that is set before us, and by faith lay hold upon it....</p>
      <p>We gain heaven not through our own merits but through the merits of Jesus Christ.... Let your hope not</p>
      <p>be centered in yourself, but in Him who has entered within the vail. Talk of the blessed hope and the glorious
          appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>It is true that we are exposed to great moral peril; it is true that we are in danger of being corrupted. But
          this danger threatens us only as we trust in self and look no higher than our own human efforts. In doing this
          we shall make shipwreck of faith.<span class="ft11">18</span></p>
      <p>In Christ our hope of eternal life is centered.... Our hope is an anchor to the soul both sure and
          steadfast</p>
      <p>when it entereth into that within the vail, for the <nobr>tempest-tossed</nobr> soul becomes a partaker of the
          divine nature. He is anchored in Christ. Amid the raging elements of temptation he will not be driven upon the
          rocks or drawn into the whirlpool. His ship will outride the storm.<span class="ft11">19</span></p>
