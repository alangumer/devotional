      <p><strong>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
          John 14:6.</strong></p>
      <p>When Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life,” He uttered a truth of wonderful signiﬁcance. The
          transgression of man had separated earth from heaven, and ﬁnite man from the inﬁnite God. As an island is
          separated from a continent, so earth was cut off from heaven, and a wide channel intervened between man and
          God. Jesus bridged this gulf, and made a way for man to come to God. He who has no spiritual light sees no
          way, has no hope, and men have originated theories of their own regarding the way to life.... But the only
          name</p>
      <p>given among men whereby they can be saved is Jesus. Across the gulf that sin has made come His words, “I am the
          way, the truth, and the life.”...</p>
      <p>Man can be justiﬁed alone through the imputation of Christ’s righteousness. Man is justiﬁed freely by God’s
          grace through faith, and not by works, lest any man should boast. Salvation is the gift of God through Jesus
          Christ our Lord....</p>
      <p>After the enemy had betrayed Adam and Eve into sin, the connection between heaven and earth was severed, and
          had it not been for Christ, the way to heaven would never have been known by the fallen race.... Christ
          is</p>
      <p>the mystic ladder, the base of which rests upon the earth, and whose topmost round reaches to the throne of the
          Inﬁnite. The children of Adam are not left desolate and alienated from God, for through Christ’s righteousness
          we have access unto the Father.</p>
      <p>“By me,” said Christ, “if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and ﬁnd pasture” (John
          10:9). Let earth be glad, let the inhabitants of the world rejoice, that Christ has bridged the gulf which sin
          had made, and has bound earth and heaven together. A highway has been cast up for the ransomed of the Lord.
          The weary and heavy laden may come unto Him and ﬁnd rest to their souls. The pilgrim may journey toward the
          mansions that He has gone to prepare for those who love Him.<span class="ft11">23</span></p>
