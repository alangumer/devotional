      <p><strong>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. John 1:29.</strong></p>
      <p>To fallen man was revealed the plan of inﬁnite sacriﬁce through which salvation was to be provided. Nothing but
          the death of God’s dear Son could expiate man’s sin, and Adam marveled at the goodness of God in providing
          such a ransom for the sinner. Through the love of God, a star of hope illumined the terrible future that
          spreads before the transgressor. Through the institution of the typical system of sacriﬁce and offering, the
          death of Christ was ever to be kept before guilty man, that he might better comprehend the nature of sin, the
          results of transgression, and the merit of the divine offering. Had there been no sin, man would never have
          known death. But in the innocent offering slain by his own hand he beheld the fruits of <nobr>sin—the</nobr>
          death of the Son of God in his behalf. He sees the immutable character of the law he has transgressed, and
          confesses his sin; he relies upon the merits of the Lamb of God....</p>
      <p>In becoming man’s substitute, in bearing the curse which should fall upon man, Christ has pledged Himself in
          behalf of the race to maintain the sacred and exalted honor of His Father’s law.... God has given the
          world</p>
      <p>into the hands of Christ, that He may completely vindicate the binding claims of the law and make manifest the
          holiness of every principle.<span class="ft15">24</span></p>
      <p>The sacriﬁce of beasts shadowed forth the sinless offering of God’s dear Son, and pointed forward to His death
          upon the cross. But at the cruciﬁxion type met antitype, and the typical system there ceased....</p>
      <p>The Son of God is the center of the great plan of redemption which covers all dispensations. He is the “Lamb
          slain from the foundation of the world” (Revelation 13:8). He is the Redeemer of the fallen sons and daughters
          of Adam in all ages of human probation. “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name
          under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).<span class="ft15">25</span></p>
