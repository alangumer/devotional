    <h1>On the Preparation Day</h1>

      <p><strong>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Exodus 20:8.</strong></p>
      <p>[Diary Entry.] Friday, Feb. 21, 1896. This day is preparation day. We would come up to the Sabbath with our
          work closed up in proper shape and not dragging into the Sabbath. We must commence in the morning to look
          after every piece of clothing if we have neglected to do this through the week, that our garments may be neat
          and orderly and comely to appear in the place where God’s people assemble to worship Him.... Entering</p>
      <p>upon new business should be avoided, if possible, but endeavor to close up the things already started that are
          half accomplished. Prepare everything connected with the household matters so that there shall be freedom from
          worries, and the mind be prepared to rest and to meditate upon heavenly things.</p>
      <p>There needs to be much more close investigation of the week past. Review it and see if, as a branch of the
          living Vine, you have drawn nourishment from the parent Vine to bear much fruit to the glory of God. If there
          has been feverish excitement, if hasty words have been spoken, if passion has been revealed, these have surely
          been the working on Satan’s side of the question. Clear the heart by confession. Sincerely make everything
          right before the Sabbath. Examine your own selves, whether ye be in the faith. We need to guard our own souls
          constantly, lest we make a great profession but, like the ﬂourishing ﬁg tree spreading its branches in
          pretentious foliage, reveal no precious fruit. Christ is hungering to see and receive fruit. Leaves of
          profession without fruit are to Christ just as worthless as those of the ﬁg tree which He cursed....</p>
      <p>The humble dependence upon God, the faith that takes Him at His word and trusts Him at all times and under all
          circumstances, is the wearing of the yoke of Christ. The Christian brings all his passions under control to
          God. Then if the thoughts are brought into captivity to Jesus Christ, there is a healthful growth in beauty
          and grace of character.<span class="ft15">26</span></p>
