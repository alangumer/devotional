    <h1>Human Versus Divine Wisdom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 1 Corinthians 2:5. The
          prevailing spirit of our times is that of inﬁdelity and apostasy. The spirit manifested in the world is one
          of</strong></p>
      <p>pride and <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> Men boast of illumination, which in reality is the blindest
          presumption, for they are in opposition to the plain Word of God. Many exalt human reason, idolize human
          wisdom, and set the opinions of men above the revealed wisdom of God.... Among the great mass of professed
          Christians the grievous character</p>
      <p>of the transgression of the law of God is not understood. They do not realize that salvation can be obtained
          only through the blood of Christ....</p>
      <p>In the eyes of men, vain philosophy and science, falsely <nobr>so-called,</nobr> are of more value than the
          Word of God. The sentiment prevails to a large extent that the divine Mediator is not essential to the
          salvation of man. A variety of theories advanced by the <nobr>so-called</nobr> worldly wise men for man’s
          elevation are believed and trusted in more than is the truth of God as taught by Christ and His apostles.<span
          class="ft11">29</span></p>
      <p>The Lord would have us individually search the Scriptures that we may become acquainted with the great plan of
          redemption and take in the grand subject as far as it is possible for the human mind, enlightened by the
          Spirit of God, to understand the purpose of God. He would have us comprehend something of His love in giving
          His Son to die that He might counteract evil, remove the deﬁling stains of sin from the workmanship of God,
          and reinstate the lost, elevating and ennobling the soul to its original purity through Christ’s imputed
          righteousness. The only way in which the fallen race could be restored was through the gift of His Son, equal
          with Himself, possessing the attributes of God....</p>
      <p>God has endowed humanity with attributes whereby we may appreciate God, and though man has revolted from God
          and has endeavored to supply the place of God with other objects of worship, the true God alone can ﬁll the
          wants of the soul.<span class="ft11">30</span></p>
