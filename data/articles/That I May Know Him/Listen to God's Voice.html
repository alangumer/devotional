    <h1>Listen to God’s Voice</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Psalm
          37:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Young men and young women will often be brought into positions where they are uncertain what to do. Their
          inclination leads them in one direction, and the Holy Spirit of God draws them in another direction. Satan
          presses his temptation upon them and urges them to follow the inclinations of the natural heart. But those who
          desire to be true to Christ will listen to the voice that says, “This is the way, walk ye in it” (Isaiah
          30:21). They will decide to take the course of the righteous, although it is more difﬁcult to pursue, more
          painful to follow, than the way of their own heart....</p>
      <p>We need to receive divine wisdom in the daily concerns of life in order that we may display sound judgment and
          choose the safe path because it is the right one. He who acts upon his own judgment will follow the
          inclination of the natural heart, but he whose mind is opened to the Word of God will prayerfully consider
          every way of his feet, so that he may honor God and keep the way of the Lord. He will remember that “even
          Christ pleased not himself,” and he will consider it a great privilege to follow in His steps. He will take
          his perplexities to God in prayer and ask the guidance of Him whose property he is. He will realize that he
          belongs to <nobr>God—soul,</nobr> body, mind, and strength....</p>
      <p>Let every youth train himself in practical lines, to trust the Lord and not to follow his own ways. “Trust in
          the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and
          he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.... Happy is
          the</p>
      <p>man that ﬁndeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.... She is more precious than rubies: and
          all</p>
      <p>the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her
          left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace” (Proverbs
          <nobr>3:5-17).<span class="ft22">2</span></nobr></p>
