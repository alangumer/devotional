    <h1>Through Christ to God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and
          hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 2 Corinthians 5:19.</strong></p>
      <p>All through the pages of sacred history, where the dealings of God with His chosen people are recorded, there
          are burning traces of the great I AM.... In all these revelations of the divine presence, the glory of
          God</p>
      <p>was manifested through Christ. Not alone at the Saviour’s advent, but through all the ages after the fall and
          the promise of redemption, “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.” Christ was the foundation
          and center of the sacriﬁcial system in both the patriarchal and the Jewish age. Since the sin of our ﬁrst
          parents, there has been no direct communication between God and man. The Father has given the world into the
          hands of Christ, that through His mediatorial work He may redeem man, and vindicate the authority and holiness
          of the law of God. All the communion between heaven and the fallen race has been through Christ. It was the
          Son of God that gave to our ﬁrst parents the promise of redemption. It was He who revealed Himself to the
          patriarchs. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses understood the gospel. They looked for salvation
          through man’s Substitute and Surety....</p>
      <p>The solemn service of the sanctuary typiﬁed the grand truths that were to be revealed through successive
          generations. The cloud of incense ascending with the prayers of Israel represents His righteousness that alone
          can make the sinner’s prayer acceptable to God; the bleeding victim on the altar of sacriﬁce testiﬁed of a
          Redeemer to come; and from the holy of holies the visible token of the divine presence shone forth. Thus
          through age after age of darkness and apostasy, faith was kept alive in the hearts of men until the time came
          for the advent of the promised Messiah. Jesus was the light of His <nobr>people,—the</nobr> light of the
          <nobr>world,—before</nobr> He came to earth in the form of humanity.... From Him has come every ray of
          heaven’s brightness that has fallen upon the inhabitants of</p>
      <p>the earth. In the plan of redemption, Christ is the Alpha and the <nobr>Omega,—the</nobr> First and the
          Last.<span class="ft15">9</span></p>
