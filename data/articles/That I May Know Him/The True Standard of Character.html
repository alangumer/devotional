    <h1>The True Standard of Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
          light in them. Isaiah 8:20.</strong></p>
      <p>There is divine grace for all who will accept it, yet there is something for us to do.... There is a work for
          us</p>
      <p>to do to ﬁt ourselves for the society of angels. We must be like Jesus, free from the deﬁlement of sin. He was
          all that He requires us to be; He was a perfect pattern for childhood, for youth, for manhood. We must study
          the Pattern more closely.</p>
      <p>Jesus was the Majesty of heaven, yet He condescended to take little children in His arms and bless them. He
          whom angels adore listened with tenderest love to their lisping, prattling praise. We must be like Him in
          noble dignity, while our hearts are softened and subdued by the divine love that dwelt in the heart of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>We have a work to do to fashion the character after the divine Model. All wrong habits must be given up. The
          impure must become pure in heart, the selﬁsh man must put away his selﬁshness, the proud man must get rid of
          his pride, the <nobr>self-sufﬁcient</nobr> man must overcome his <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> and realize that
          he is nothing without Christ....</p>
      <p>We need to be anchored in Christ, rooted and grounded in the faith. Satan works through agents. He selects
          those who have not been drinking of the living waters, whose souls are athirst for something new and strange,
          and who are ever ready to drink at any fountain that may present itself. Voices will be heard, saying, “Lo,
          here is Christ,” or “Lo there,” but we must believe them not. We have unmistakable evidence of the voice of
          the True Shepherd, and He is calling upon us to follow Him. He says, “I have kept my Father’s commandments.”
          He leads His sheep in the path of humble obedience to the law of God, but He never encourages them in the
          transgression of that law....</p>
      <p>None need be deceived. The law of God is as sacred as His throne, and by it every man who cometh into the world
          is to be judged. There is no other standard by which to test character.<span class="ft15">25</span></p>
