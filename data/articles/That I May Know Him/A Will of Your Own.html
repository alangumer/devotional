    <h1>A Will of Your Own?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. Proverbs
          19:11.</strong></p>
      <p>There are duties to the body and duties to the soul, and these every human agent must cooperate with God in
          seeking to perform.... Do not submit to receive a cheap mold. The young need sound common sense, for they</p>
      <p>are living for two worlds....</p>
      <p>Apply the truth to your own individual case. You have a soul to save or a soul to lose. Have a will of your
          own, but let it be subject to the will of God. Be determined that you will not become angry, that you will not
          become <nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr> that you will not be hasty and overbearing. If this is your weak point,
          guard that point as a man would guard a broken limb. Watch your spirit, and let not a hasty spirit conquer
          you. Be careful to examine the weak points in your character, knowing that the evils which exist may be
          overcome by steadfastly refusing to yield to your weakness. The evil of hasty, wicked, indulgence of temper
          makes any youth a madman. Keep sane. A soft answer turneth away wrath. Evil can and will grow ... through
          repetition.</p>
      <p>Do not underrate the importance of little things because they are little. By action and reaction these little
          defects accumulate and bind themselves together like rods of steel. That little action, that unguarded word,
          repeated, becomes habit, ... and habit constitutes character....</p>
      <p>Cultivate a kind, tender, sympathetic heart, and never call these attributes weakness, for they are the
          attributes of Christ. Be careful of your inﬂuence. Let it be of so pure and fragrant a character that you will
          never be ashamed to have it reproduced in others.</p>
      <p>As drops of water make the river, so little things make up life. Life is a river, peaceful, calm, and
          enjoyable, or it is a troubled river, always casting up mire and dirt. In this life you may place yourself
          under the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Through the sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit you will thus grow more and
          more like Christ.<span class="ft17">37</span></p>
