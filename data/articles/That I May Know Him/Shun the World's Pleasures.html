    <h1>Shun the World’s Pleasures</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
          the Father is not in him. 1 John 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The true Christian will not desire to enter any place of amusement or engage in any diversion upon which he
          cannot ask the blessing of God. He will not be found at the theater, the billiard hall, or the bowling saloon.
          He will not unite with the gay waltzers, or indulge in any other bewitching pleasure that will banish Christ
          from the mind.</p>
      <p>To those who plead for these diversions, we answer, We cannot indulge in them in the name of Jesus of
          Nazareth.... Go in imagination to Gethsemane and behold the anguish which Christ endured for us. See the</p>
      <p>world’s Redeemer wrestling in superhuman agony, the sins of the whole world upon His soul. Hear His prayer,
          borne upon the sympathizing breeze, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless
          not as I will, but as thou wilt” (Matthew 26:39). The hour of darkness has come. Christ has entered the shadow
          of His cross. Alone He must drink the bitter cup. Of all earth’s children whom He has blessed and comforted
          there is not one to console Him in this dreadful hour. He is betrayed into the hands of a murderous mob. Faint
          and weary, He is dragged from one tribunal to another.... He who knew not the taint of sin pours out His
          life</p>
      <p>as a malefactor upon Calvary. This history should stir every soul to its depths. It was to save us that the Son
          of God became a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.... Let a sense of the inﬁnite sacriﬁce made for
          our</p>
      <p>redemption be ever with you, and the ballroom will lose its attractions.</p>
      <p>Not only did Christ die as our sacriﬁce, but He lived as our example. In His human nature He stands, complete,
          perfect, spotless. To be a Christian is to be Christlike. Our entire <nobr>being—soul,</nobr> body, and
          <nobr>spirit—must</nobr> be puriﬁed, ennobled, sanctiﬁed, until we shall reﬂect His image and imitate His
          example.... We need not fear to</p>
      <p>engage in any pursuit or pleasure that will aid us in this work. But it is our duty to shun everything that
          would divert our attention or lessen our zeal.<span class="ft15">1</span></p>
