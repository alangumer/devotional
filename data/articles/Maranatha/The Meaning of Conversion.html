    <h1>Chap. 229—The Meaning of Conversion</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are
          become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The old nature, born of blood and the will of the ﬂesh, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. The old ways, the
          hereditary tendencies, the former habits, must be given up; for grace is not inherited. The new birth consists
          in having new motives, new tastes, new tendencies. Those who are begotten unto a new life by the Holy Spirit,
          have become partakers of the divine nature, and in all their habits and practices they will give evidence of
          their relationship to Christ. When men who claim to be Christians retain all their natural defects of
          character and disposition, in what does their position differ from that of the worldling? They do not
          appreciate the truth as a sanctiﬁer, a reﬁner. They have not been born again....</p>
      <p>A genuine conversion changes hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong. The religion of God is a ﬁrm
          fabric, composed of innumerable threads, and woven together with tact and skill. Only the wisdom which comes
          from God can make this fabric complete. There are a great many kinds of cloth which at ﬁrst have a ﬁne
          appearance, but they cannot endure the test. They wash out. The colors are not fast. Under the heat of summer
          they fade away and are lost. The cloth cannot endure rough handling.</p>
      <p>So it is with the religion of many. When the warp and woof of character will not stand the test of trial, the
          material of which it is composed is worthless. The efforts made to patch the old with a new piece do not
          better the condition of things; for the old, ﬂimsy material breaks away from the new, leaving the rent much
          larger than before. Patching will not do. The only way is to discard the old garment altogether, and procure
          one entirely new.</p>
      <p>Christ’s plan is the only safe one. He declares, “Behold, I make all things new.” “If any man be in Christ, he
          is a new creature.” ... The patchwork religion is not of the least value with God. He requires the whole
          heart.</p>
      <p>Jesus gave His life ... for us, and shall we not give Him our best affections, our holiest aspirations, our
          fullest service?</p>
