    <h1>Chap. 259—Seven Last Plagues Begin to Fall</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the
          vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. Revelation 16:1.</strong></p>
      <p>When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship
          the beast and his image and receive his mark (Revelation 14:9, 10), will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt
          when God was about to deliver Israel were similar in character to those more terrible and extensive judgments
          which are to fall upon the world just before the ﬁnal deliverance of God’s people. Says the revelator, in
          describing those terriﬁc scourges: “There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of
          the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.” The sea “became as the blood of a dead man: and every
          living soul died in the sea.” And “the rivers and fountains of waters ...became blood.” Terrible as these
          inﬂictions are, God’s justice stands fully vindicated. The angel of God declares: “Thou art righteous, O Lord,
          ... because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given
          them blood to drink; for they are worthy.” Revelation <nobr>16:2-6.</nobr> By condemning the people of God to
          death, they have as truly incurred the guilt of their blood as if it had been shed by their hands....</p>
      <p>In the plague that follows, power is given to the sun “to scorch men with ﬁre. And men were scorched with great
          heat.” Verse 8, 9....</p>
      <p>These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the
          most awful scourges that have ever been known to mortals. All the judgments upon men, prior to the close of
          probation, have been mingled with mercy. The pleading blood of Christ has shielded the sinner from receiving
          the full measure of his guilt; but in the ﬁnal judgment, wrath is poured out unmixed with mercy.</p>
      <p>The bolts of God’s wrath are soon to fall, and when He shall begin to punish the transgressors, there will be
          no period of respite until the end. The storm of God’s wrath is gathering, and those only will stand who are
          sanctiﬁed through the truth in the love of God. They shall be hid with Christ in God till the desolation shall
          be overpast.</p>
