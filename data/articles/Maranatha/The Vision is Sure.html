    <h1>Chap. 58—The Vision is Sure</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry,
          wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. Habakkuk 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The faith that strengthened Habakkuk and all the holy and the just in those days of deep trial was the same
          faith that sustains God’s people today. In the darkest hours, under circumstances the most forbidding, the
          Christian believer may keep his soul stayed upon the source of all light and power. Day by day, through faith
          in God, his hope and courage may be renewed.... In the service of God there need be</p>
      <p>no despondency, no wavering, no fear. The Lord will more than fulﬁll the highest expectations of those who put
          their trust in Him. He will give them the wisdom their varied necessities demand.</p>
      <p>Of the abundant provision made for every tempted soul, the apostle Paul bears eloquent testimony. To him was
          given the divine assurance, “My grace is sufﬁcient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” In
          gratitude and conﬁdence the tried servant of God responded: “Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
          inﬁrmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in inﬁrmities, in reproaches,
          in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.” 2
          Corinthians 12:9, 10.</p>
      <p>We must cherish and cultivate the faith of which prophets and apostles have <nobr>testiﬁed—the</nobr> faith
          that lays hold on the promises of God and waits for deliverance in His appointed time and way. The sure word
          of prophecy will meet its ﬁnal fulﬁllment in the glorious advent of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as King
          of kings and Lord of lords. The time of waiting may seem long, the soul may be oppressed by discouraging
          circumstances, many in whom conﬁdence has been placed may fall by the way; but with the prophet who endeavored
          to encourage Judah in a time of unparalleled apostasy, let us conﬁdently declare, “The Lord is in his holy
          temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”</p>
      <p>Let us ever hold in remembrance the cheering message, “The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end
          it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry....
          The just shall live by his faith.”</p>
