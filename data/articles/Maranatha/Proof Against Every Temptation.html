    <h1>Chap. 83—Proof Against Every Temptation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Yield yourselves unto God, ... and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall
          not have dominion over you. Romans 6:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>There is but one power that can break the hold of evil from the hearts of men, and that is the power of God in
          Jesus Christ.... His grace alone can enable us to</p>
      <p>resist and subdue the tendencies of our fallen nature.</p>
      <p>The inﬁnite value of the sacriﬁce required for our redemption reveals the fact that sin is a tremendous evil.
          Through sin the whole human organism is deranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination corrupted. Sin has
          degraded the faculties of the soul. Temptations from without ﬁnd an answering chord within the heart, and the
          feet turn imperceptibly toward evil. As the sacriﬁce in our behalf was complete, so our restoration from the
          deﬁlement of sin is to be complete. There is no act of wickedness that the law will excuse; there is no
          unrighteousness that will escape its condemnation. The life of Christ was a perfect fulﬁllment of every
          precept of the law. He said; “I have kept my Father’s commandments.” John 15:10. His life is our standard of
          obedience and service.</p>
      <p>Today Satan presents the same temptations that he presented to Christ, offering us the kingdoms of the world in
          return for our allegiance. But upon him who looks to Jesus as the author and ﬁnisher of his faith, Satan’s
          temptations have no power. He cannot cause to sin the one who will accept by faith the virtues of Him who was
          tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin.</p>
      <p>The expulsion of sin is the act of the soul itself. True, we have no power to free ourselves from Satan’s
          control; but when we desire to be set free from sin, and in our great need cry out for a power out of and
          above ourselves, the powers of the soul are imbued with the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they obey
          the dictates of the will in fulﬁlling the will of God.</p>
      <p>God will have a people zealous of good works, standing ﬁrm amid the pollutions of this degenerate age. There
          will be a people who hold so fast to the divine strength that they will be proof against every
          temptation.</p>
