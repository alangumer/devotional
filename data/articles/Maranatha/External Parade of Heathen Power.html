    <h1>Chap. 132—External Parade of Heathen Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap
          to themselves teachers, having itching ears. 2 Timothy 4:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Rapidly are men ranging themselves under the banner they have chosen, restlessly waiting and watching the
          movements of their leaders. There are those who are watching and waiting and working for our Lord’s appearing;
          while the other party are rapidly falling into line under the generalship of the ﬁrst great apostate. They
          look for a God in humanity, and Satan personiﬁes the one they seek. Multitudes will be so deluded through
          their rejection of truth, that they will accept the counterfeit. Humanity is hailed as God.</p>
      <p>As we near the close of time, there will be greater and still greater external parade of heathen power; heathen
          deities will manifest their signal power, and will exhibit themselves before the cities of the world; and this
          delineation has already begun to be fulﬁlled. By a variety of images the Lord Jesus represented to John the
          wicked character and seductive inﬂuence of those who have been distinguished for their persecution of God’s
          people. All need wisdom carefully to search out the mystery of iniquity that ﬁgures so largely in the winding
          up of this earth’s history....</p>
      <p>In the very time in which we live, the Lord has called His people and has given them a message to bear. He has
          called them to expose the wickedness of the man of sin who has made the Sunday law a distinctive power, who
          has thought to change times and laws, and to oppress the people of God who stand ﬁrmly to honor Him by keeping
          the only true Sabbath, the Sabbath of creation....</p>
      <p>The perils of the last days are upon us, and in our work we are to warn the people of the danger they are in.
          Let not the solemn scenes which prophecy has revealed be left untouched. If our people were half awake, if
          they realized the nearness of the events portrayed in the Revelation, a reformation would be wrought in our
          churches, and many more would believe the message. We have no time to lose; God calls upon us to watch for
          souls as they that must give an account.</p>
