    <h1>Chap. 131—Youth and the Drug Syndrome</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in
          the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will
          bring thee into judgment. Ecclesiastes 11:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan was the ﬁrst rebel in the universe, and ever since his expulsion from heaven he has been seeking to make
          every member of the human family an apostate from God, even as he is himself. He laid his plans to ruin man,
          and through the unlawful indulgence of appetite, led him to transgress the commandments of God. He tempted
          Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit, and so accomplished their fall, and their expulsion from Eden.
          How many say, “If I had been in Adam’s place, I would never have transgressed on so simple a test.” But you
          who make this boast have a grand opportunity of showing your strength of purpose, your ﬁdelity to principle
          under trial.... Does God see no sin in your life? ...</p>
      <p>On every side, Satan seeks to entice the youth into the path of perdition; and if he can once get their feet
          set in the way, he hurries them on in their downward course, leading them from one dissipation to another,
          until his victims lose their tenderness of conscience, and have no more the fear of God before their eyes.
          They exercise less and less <nobr>self-restraint.</nobr> They become addicted to the use of wine and alcohol,
          tobacco and opium, and go from one stage of debasement to another. They are slaves to appetite. Counsel which
          they once respected, they learn to despise. They put on swaggering airs, and boast of liberty when they are
          the servants of corruption. They mean by liberty that they are slaves to selﬁshness, debased appetite, and
          licentiousness....</p>
      <p>Satan is determined to have the human race as his subjects, but Christ has paid an inﬁnite price that man may
          be redeemed from the enemy, and that the moral image of God may be restored to the fallen race.... Fallen men
          may through Christ</p>
      <p>ﬁnd access to the Father, may have grace to enable them to be overcomers through the merits of a cruciﬁed and
          risen Saviour.</p>
