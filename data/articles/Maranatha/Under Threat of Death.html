    <h1>Chap. 190—Under Threat of Death</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance
          arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth
          whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? Esther 4:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Wonderful events are soon to open before the world. The end of all things is at hand. The time of trouble is
          about to come upon the people of God. Then it is that the decree will go forth forbidding those who keep the
          Sabbath of the Lord to buy or sell, threatening them with punishment, and even death, if they do not observe
          the ﬁrst day of the week as the Sabbath.</p>
      <p>The decree which is to go forth against the people of God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus
          against the Jews in the time of Esther.... Satan instigated</p>
      <p>the scheme in order to rid the earth of those who preserved the knowledge of the true God. But his plots were
          defeated by a counterpower that reigns among the children of men....</p>
      <p>The Protestant world today see in the little company keeping the Sabbath a Mordecai in the gate. His character
          and conduct, expressing reverence for the law of God, are a constant rebuke to those who have cast off the
          fear of the Lord and are trampling upon His Sabbath; the unwelcome intruder must by some means be put out of
          the way.</p>
      <p>The same masterful mind that plotted against the faithful in ages past is still seeking to rid the earth of
          those who fear God and obey His law. Satan will excite indignation against the humble minority who
          conscientiously refuse to accept popular customs and traditions. Men of position and reputation will join with
          the lawless and the vile to take counsel against the people of God.... Not having a “Thus</p>
      <p>saith the Scriptures” to bring against the advocates of the Bible Sabbath, they will resort to oppressive
          enactments to supply the lack.... On this battleﬁeld comes the</p>
      <p>last great conﬂict of the controversy between truth and error. And we are not left in doubt as to the issue.
          Now, as in the days of Mordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and His people.</p>
