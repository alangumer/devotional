    <h1>Chap. 145—Low State of Morals</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh
          saints. Ephesians 5:3.</strong></p>
      <p>There is an alarming commonness in conversation at the present day, which shows a low state of thoughts and
          morals. True dignity of character is very rare. True modesty and reserve are seldom seen. There are but few
          who are pure and undeﬁled....</p>
      <p>Polluted thoughts harbored become habit, and the soul is scarred and deﬁled. Once do a wrong action and a blot
          is made which nothing can heal but the blood of Christ; and if the habit is not turned from with ﬁrm
          determination, the soul is corrupted and the streams ﬂowing from this deﬁling fountain corrupt others.</p>
      <p>There are men and women who invite temptation; they place themselves in positions where they will be tempted,
          where they cannot but be tempted, when they place themselves in society that is objectionable. The best way to
          keep safe from sin is to move with due consideration at all times and under all circumstances, never to move
          or act from impulse. Move with the fear of God ever before you and you will be sure to act right.</p>
      <p>The moral dangers to which all, both old and young, are exposed are daily increasing. Moral derangement, which
          we call depravity, ﬁnds ample room to work, and an inﬂuence is exerted by men, women, and youth professing to
          be Christians that is low, sensual, devilish....</p>
      <p>Those who have learned the truth and do not have works corresponding with their profession of faith are subject
          to Satan’s temptations. They encounter danger at every step they advance. They are brought into contact with
          evil, they see sights, they hear sounds, that will awaken their unsubdued passions; they are subjected to
          inﬂuences that lead them to choose the evil rather than the good, because they are not sound at heart....</p>
      <p>There is no training we need so much now as the preparing of young men and women to have moral rectitude and to
          cleanse their souls of every spot and stain of moral deﬁlement.</p>
