    <h1>Chap. 2—The Lesson of Bethlehem</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the
          second time without sin unto salvation. Hebrews 9:28.</strong></p>
      <p>At the time of Christ’s ﬁrst advent the priests and scribes of the Holy City, to whom were entrusted the
          oracles of God, might have discerned the signs of the times and proclaimed the coming of the Promised One. The
          prophecy of Micah designated His birthplace; Daniel speciﬁed the time of His advent. God committed these
          prophecies to the Jewish leaders; they were without excuse if they did not know and declare to the people that
          the Messiah’s coming was at hand. Their ignorance was the result of sinful neglect....</p>
      <p>All the people should have been watching and waiting that they might be among the ﬁrst to welcome the world’s
          Redeemer. But, lo, at Bethlehem two weary travelers from the hills of Nazareth traverse the whole length of
          the narrow street to the eastern extremity of the town, vainly seeking a place of rest and shelter for the
          night. No doors are open to receive them. In a wretched hovel prepared for cattle, they at last ﬁnd refuge,
          and there the Saviour of the world is born....</p>
      <p>There is no evidence that Christ is expected, and no preparation for the Prince of life. In amazement the
          celestial messenger is about to return to heaven with the shameful tidings, when he discovers a group of
          shepherds who are watching their ﬂocks by night, and as they gaze into the starry heavens, are contemplating
          the prophecy of a Messiah to come to earth, and longing for the advent of the world’s Redeemer. Here is a
          company that is prepared to receive the heavenly message. And suddenly the angel of the Lord appears,
          declaring the good tidings of great joy....</p>
      <p>Oh, what a lesson is this wonderful story of Bethlehem! How it rebukes our unbelief, our pride and
          <nobr>self-sufﬁciency.</nobr> How it warns us to beware, lest by our criminal indifference we also fail to
          discern the signs of the times, and therefore know not the day of our visitation.</p>
