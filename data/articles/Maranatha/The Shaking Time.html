    <h1>Chap. 192—The Shaking Time</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. Matthew 24:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Just as soon as the people of God are sealed in their <nobr>foreheads—it</nobr> is not any seal or mark that
          can be seen, but a settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they cannot be
          <nobr>moved—just</nobr> as soon as God’s people are sealed and prepared for the shaking, it will come. Indeed,
          it has begun already; the judgments of God are now upon the land, to give us warning, that we may know what is
          coming.</p>
      <p>The days are fast approaching when there will be great perplexity and confusion. Satan, clothed in angel robes,
          will deceive, if possible, the very elect. There will be gods many and lords many. Every wind of doctrine will
          be blowing....</p>
      <p>The mark of the beast will be urged upon us. Those who have step by step yielded to worldly demands and
          conformed to worldly customs will not ﬁnd it a hard matter to yield to the powers that be, rather than subject
          themselves to derision, insult, threatened imprisonment, and death. The contest is between the commandments of
          God and the commandments of men. In this time the gold will be separated from the dross in the church. True
          godliness will be clearly distinguished from the appearance and tinsel of it. Many a star that we have admired
          for its brilliancy will then go out in darkness. Chaff like a cloud will be borne away on the wind, even from
          places where we see only ﬂoors of rich wheat. All who assume the ornaments of the sanctuary, but are not
          clothed with Christ’s righteousness, will appear in the shame of their own nakedness.</p>
      <p>But there are men who will receive the truth, and these will take the places made vacant by those who become
          offended and leave the truth....</p>
      <p>Men of true Christian principle will take their place, and will become faithful, trustworthy householders, to
          advocate the word of God in its true bearings, and in its simplicity. The Lord will work so that the
          disaffected ones will be separated from the true and loyal ones.... The ranks will not be diminished. Those
          who are ﬁrm and</p>
      <p>true will close up the vacancies that are made by those who become offended and apostatize.</p>
