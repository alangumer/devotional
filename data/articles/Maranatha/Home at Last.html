    <h1>Chap. 311—Home at Last!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Well done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew
          25:21.</strong></p>
      <p>As your senses delight in the attractive loveliness of the earth, think of the world that is to come, that
          shall never know the blight of sin and death; where the face of nature will no more wear the shadow of the
          curse. Let your imagination picture the home of the saved, and remember that it will be more glorious than
          your brightest imagination can portray. In the varied gifts of God in nature we see but the faintest gleaming
          of His glory. It is written, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
          the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” 1 Corinthians 2:9.</p>
      <p>By and by the gates of heaven will be thrown open to admit God’s children, and from the lips of the King of
          glory the benediction will fall on their ears like richest music, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
          kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Matthew 25:34.</p>
      <p>Then the redeemed will be welcomed to the home that Jesus is preparing for them.</p>
      <p>Then I saw Jesus lead the redeemed company to the gate of the city. He laid hold of the gate and swung it back
          on its glittering hinges and bade the nations that had kept the truth enter in. Within the city there was
          everything to feast the eye. Rich glory they beheld everywhere. Then Jesus looked upon His redeemed saints;
          their countenances were radiant with glory; and as He ﬁxed His loving eyes upon them. He said, with His rich,
          musical voice, “I behold the travail of My soul, and am satisﬁed. This rich glory is yours to enjoy eternally.
          Your sorrows are ended. There shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any
          more pain.” ...</p>
      <p>Language is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of heaven. As the scene rises before me, I am lost
          in amazement. Carried away with the surpassing splendor and excellent glory, I lay down the pen, and exclaim,
          “Oh, what love! what wondrous love!” The most exalted language fails to describe the glory of heaven or the
          matchless depths of a Saviour’s love.</p>
