    <h1>Chap. 189—Betrayed by Friends and Relatives</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A man’s foes shall be they of his own household. Matthew 10:36.</strong></p>
      <p>When the law of God is made void, and the church is sifted by the ﬁery trials that are to try all that live
          upon the earth, a great proportion of those who are supposed to be genuine will give heed to seducing spirits,
          and will turn traitors and betray sacred trusts. They will prove our very worst persecutors. “Of your own
          selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them;” and many will give heed
          to seducing spirits.</p>
      <p>Those who apostatize in time of trial will bear false witness and betray their brethren, to secure their own
          safety. They will tell where their brethren are concealed, putting the wolves on their track. Christ has
          warned us of this, that we may not be surprised at the cruel, unnatural course pursued by friends and
          relatives.</p>
      <p>We shall ﬁnd that we must let loose of all hands except the hand of Jesus Christ. Friends will prove
          treacherous, and will betray us. Relatives, deceived by the enemy, will think they do God service in opposing
          us and putting forth the utmost efforts to bring us into hard places, hoping we will deny our faith. But we
          may trust our hand in the hand of Christ amid darkness and peril.</p>
      <p>The followers of Christ must expect to encounter sneers. They will be reviled; their words and their faith will
          be misrepresented. Coldness and contempt may be harder to endure than martyrdom....</p>
      <p>Parents will turn harshly against their children who accept unpopular truth. Those who conscientiously serve
          God will be accused of rebellion. Property that was willed to children or other relatives who believe the
          present truth will be given into other hands. Guardians will rob orphans and widows of their just dues. Those
          who depart from evil will make themselves a prey through laws enacted to compel the conscience. Men will take
          to themselves property to which they have no right. The words of the apostle will be veriﬁed in the near
          future: “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”</p>
