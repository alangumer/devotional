    <h1>Chap. 148—Counterfeits!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
          light in them. Isaiah 8:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The people of God are directed to the Scriptures as their safeguard against the inﬂuence of false teachers and
          the delusive power of spirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent men from obtaining a
          knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions. At every revival of God’s work the
          prince of evil is aroused to more intense activity; he is now putting forth his utmost efforts for a ﬁnal
          struggle against Christ and His followers. The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to
          perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true that it will be
          impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and
          every miracle must be tested....</p>
      <p>The man who makes the working of miracles the test of his faith will ﬁnd that Satan can, through a species of
          deceptions, perform wonders that will appears to be genuine miracles.</p>
      <p>Satan is a cunning worker, and he will bring in subtle fallacies to darken and confuse the mind and root out
          the doctrines of salvation. Those who do not accept the Word of God just as it reads, will be snared in his
          trap.</p>
      <p>Evil angels are upon our track every moment.... They assume new ground and</p>
      <p>work marvels and miracles in our sight....</p>
      <p>Some will be tempted to receive these wonders as from God. The sick will be healed before us. Miracles will be
          performed in our sight. Are we prepared for the trial which awaits us when the lying wonders of Satan shall be
          more fully exhibited? Will not many souls be ensnared and taken? By departing from the plain precepts and
          commandments of God, and giving heed to fables, the minds of many are preparing to receive these lying
          wonders. We must all now seek to arm ourselves for the contest in which we must soon engage. Faith in God’s
          word, prayerfully studied and practically applied, will be our shield from Satan’s power and will bring us off
          conquerors through the blood of Christ.</p>
