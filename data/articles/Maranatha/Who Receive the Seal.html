    <h1>Chap. 233—Who Receive the Seal?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God. Revelation
          14:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Only those who receive the seal of the living God will have the passport through the gates of the Holy
          City....</p>
      <p>The seal of the living God will be placed upon those only who bear a likeness to Christ in character.</p>
      <p>As wax takes the impression of the seal, so the soul is to take the impression of the Spirit of God and retain
          the image of Christ.</p>
      <p>Many will not receive the seal of God because they do not keep His commandments or bear the fruits of
          righteousness.</p>
      <p>The great mass of professing Christians will meet with bitter disappointment in the day of God. They have not
          upon their foreheads the seal of the living God. Lukewarm and halfhearted, they dishonor God far more than the
          avowed unbeliever. They grope in darkness, when they might be walking in the noonday light of the Word, under
          the guidance of One who never errs....</p>
      <p>Those whom the Lamb shall lead by the fountains of living waters, and from whose eyes He shall wipe away all
          tears, will be those now receiving the knowledge and understanding revealed in the Bible, the Word of
          God....</p>
      <p>We are to copy no human being. There is no human being wise enough to be our criterion. We are to look to the
          man Christ Jesus, who is complete in the perfection of righteousness and holiness. He is the author and
          ﬁnisher of our faith. He is the pattern man. His experience is the measure of the experience that we are to
          gain. His character is our model. Let us, then, take our minds off the perplexities and the difﬁculties of
          this life, and ﬁx them on Him, that by beholding we may be changed into His likeness. We may behold Christ to
          good purpose. We may safely look to Him; for He is <nobr>all-wise.</nobr> As we look to Him and think of Him,
          He will be formed within, the hope of glory.</p>
      <p>Let us strive with all the power that God has given us to be among the hundred and <nobr>forty-four</nobr>
          thousand.</p>
