    <h1>Chap. 195—The Church Appears About to Fall</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking
          child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget
          thee. Isaiah 49:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his power as supreme. The church may appear as about to
          fall, but it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted <nobr>out—the</nobr> chaff
          separated from the precious wheat. This is a terrible ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place. None but
          those who have been overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony will be found with the
          loyal and true, without spot or stain of sin, without guile in their mouths....</p>
      <p>The remnant that purify their souls by obeying the truth gather strength from the trying process, exhibiting
          the beauty of holiness amid the surrounding apostasy.</p>
      <p>I know that the Lord loves His church. It is not to be disorganized or broken up into independent atoms. There
          is not the least consistency in this; there is not the least evidence that such a thing will be. Those who
          shall heed this false message and try to leaven others will be deceived and prepared to receive advanced
          delusions, and they will come to nought.</p>
      <p>I am encouraged and blessed as I realize that the God of Israel is still guiding His people, and that He will
          continue to be with them, even to the end.</p>
      <p>We cannot now step off the foundation that God has established. We cannot now enter into any new organization;
          for this would mean apostasy from the truth.</p>
      <p>The church, soon to enter upon her most severe conﬂict, will be the object most dear to God upon earth. The
          confederacy of evil will be stirred with power from beneath, and Satan will cast all the reproach possible
          upon the chosen ones whom he cannot deceive and delude with his satanic inventions and falsehoods. But exalted
          “to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins,” will Christ, our
          representative and head, close His heart, or withdraw His hand, or falsify His promise? No; never, never.</p>
