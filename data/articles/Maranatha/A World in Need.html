    <h1>Chap. 95—A World in Need</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. Isaiah
          59:9.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot understand their true import. All over the world men
          and women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light,
          for grace, for the Holy Spirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be gathered in.</p>
      <p>Everywhere there are hearts crying out for something which they have not. They long for a power that will give
          them mastery over sin, a power that will deliver them from the bondage of evil, a power that will give health
          and life and peace. Many who once knew the power of God’s word have dwelt where there is no recognition of
          God, and they long for the divine presence.</p>
      <p>The world needs today what it needed nineteen hundred years <nobr>ago—a</nobr> revelation of Christ. A great
          work of reform is demanded, and it is only through the grace of Christ that the work of restoration, physical,
          mental, and spiritual, can be accomplished.</p>
      <p>Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who
          desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their conﬁdence. Then
          He bade them, “Follow me.”</p>
      <p>There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort.... We are to weep</p>
      <p>with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of
          prayer, the power of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without fruit.</p>
      <p>Heavenly intelligences are waiting to cooperate with human instrumentalities, that they may reveal to the world
          what human beings may become, and what, through union with the Divine, may be accomplished for the saving of
          souls that are ready to perish. There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, putting self aside, makes room
          for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart and lives a life wholly consecrated to God.</p>
