    <h1>Chap. 179—Protestantism Unites with the Papacy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive
          power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the
          beast. Revelation 17:12, 13.</strong></p>
      <p>As we approach the last crisis, it is of vital moment that harmony and unity exist among the Lord’s
          instrumentalities. The world is ﬁlled with storm and war and variance. Yet under one <nobr>head—the</nobr>
          papal <nobr>power—the</nobr> people will unite to oppose God in the person of His witnesses.</p>
      <p>What is it that gives its kingdom to this power? Protestantism, a power which, while professing to have the
          temper and spirit of a lamb and to be allied to Heaven, speaks with the voice of a dragon. It is moved by a
          power from beneath.</p>
      <p>“These have one mind.” There will be a universal bond of union, one great harmony, a confederacy of Satan’s
          forces. “And shall give their power and strength unto the beast.” Thus is manifested the same arbitrary,
          oppressive power against religious liberty, freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, as
          was manifested by the papacy, when in the past it persecuted those who dared to refuse to conform with the
          religious rites and ceremonies of Romanism.</p>
      <p>In the warfare to be waged in the last days there will be united, in opposition to God’s people, all the
          corrupt powers that have apostatized from allegiance to the law of Jehovah. In this warfare the Sabbath of the
          fourth commandment will be the great point at issue; for in the Sabbath commandment the great Lawgiver
          identiﬁes Himself as the Creator of the heavens and the earth.</p>
      <p>Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people
          under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of
          sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the
          gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power;
          and under the inﬂuence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on
          the rights of conscience.</p>
