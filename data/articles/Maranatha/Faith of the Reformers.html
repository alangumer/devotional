    <h1>Chap. 7—The Key to History</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will
          enquire, enquire ye: return, come. Isaiah 21:11 (last part), 12.</strong></p>
      <p>An understanding of the hope of Christ’s second coming is the key that unlocks all the history that follows,
          and explains all the future lessons.</p>
      <p>The voice of the true watchman needs now to be heard all along the line, “The morning cometh, and also the
          night.” The trumpet must give a certain sound, for we are in the great day of the Lord’s preparation.</p>
      <p>The truths of prophecy are bound up together, and as we study them, they form a beautiful cluster of practical
          Christian truth. All the discourses that we give are plainly to reveal that we are waiting, working, and
          praying for the coming of the Son of God. His coming is our hope. This hope is to be bound up with all our
          words and works, with all our associations and relationships....</p>
      <p>The second coming of the Son of man is to be the wonderful theme kept before the people. Here is a subject that
          should not be left out of our discourses. Eternal realities must be kept before the mind’s eye, and the
          attractions of the world will appear as they are, altogether proﬁtless as vanity. What are we to do with the
          world’s vanities, its praises, its riches, its honors, or its enjoyments?</p>
      <p>We are pilgrims and strangers who are waiting, hoping, and praying for that blessed hope, the glorious
          appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If we believe this and bring it into our practical life, what
          vigorous action would this faith and hope inspire; what fervent love one for another; what careful holy living
          for the glory of God; and in our respect for the recompense of the reward, what distinct lines of demarcation
          would be evidenced between us and the world....</p>
      <p>The truth that Christ is coming should be kept before every mind.</p>

          Such was the hope of the apostolic church, of the “church in the wilderness,” and of the Reformers.</p>
