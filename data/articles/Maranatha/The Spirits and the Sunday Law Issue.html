    <h1>Chap. 159—The Spirits and the Sunday Law Issue</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
          light in them. Isaiah 8:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The <nobr>miracle-working</nobr> power manifested through spiritualism will exert its inﬂuence against those
          who choose to obey God rather than men. Communications from the spirits will declare that God has sent them to
          convince the rejecters of Sunday of their error, afﬁrming that the laws of the land should be obeyed as the
          law of God. They will lament the great wickedness in the world and second the testimony of religious teachers
          that the degraded state of morals is caused by the desecration of Sunday. Great will be the indignation
          excited against all who refuse to accept their testimony.</p>
      <p>Those who oppose the teachings of spiritualism are assailing, not men alone, but Satan and his angels. They
          have entered upon a contest against principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places. Satan will
          not yield one inch of ground except as he is driven back by the power of heavenly messengers. The people of
          God should be able to meet him, as did our Saviour, with the words: “It is written.” Satan can quote Scripture
          now as in the days of Christ, and he will pervert its teachings to sustain his delusions. Those who would
          stand in this time of peril must understand for themselves the testimony of the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>Many will be confronted by the spirits of devils personating beloved relatives or friends and declaring the
          most dangerous heresies. These visitants will appeal to our tenderest sympathies and will work miracles to
          sustain their pretensions. We must be prepared to withstand them with the Bible truth that the dead know not
          anything and that they who thus appear are the spirits of devils.</p>
      <p>Satanic agencies in human form will take part in this last great conﬂict to oppose the building up of the
          kingdom of God. And heavenly angels in human guise will be on the ﬁeld of action. The two opposing parties
          will continue to exist till the closing up of the last great chapter in this world’s history.</p>
