    <h1>Chap. 212—High Time to Awake!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
          nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works
          of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Romans 13:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>The great controversy is nearing its end. Every report of calamity by sea or land is a testimony to the fact
          that the end of all things is at hand. Wars and rumors of wars declare it. Is there a Christian whose pulse
          does not beat with quickened action as he anticipates the great events opening before us? The Lord is coming.
          We hear the footsteps of an approaching God.</p>
      <p>This knowledge of the nearness of Christ’s coming should not be allowed to lose its force, and we become
          careless and inattentive, and fall into <nobr>slumber—into</nobr> an insensibility and indifference to
          realities. In slumber we are in an unreal world, and not sensible of the things which are taking place around
          us....</p>
      <p>There are those who have the blazing light of truth shining all around them, and yet are insensible to it. They
          are enchanted by the enemy, held under a spell by his bewitching power. They are not preparing for that great
          day which is soon to come to our world. They seem utterly insensible to religious truth.</p>
      <p>Are there not some youth who are awake? Those who see that the night cometh, and also the morning, should work
          with untiring energy to arouse their sleeping associates. Can they not feel their peril, pray for them, and
          show them by their own life and character that they believe themselves that Christ is soon to come? ...</p>
      <p>The rapidly diminishing space of time between us and eternity should more deeply impress us. Every day that
          passes makes one less left us to complete our work of perfecting character....</p>
      <p>As long as there are many asleep, many sporting away the precious hours in careless indifference, as it were,
          upon the very brink of the eternal world, those who do believe must be sober, must be awake, must be earnest
          and diligent, and watch unto prayer....</p>
      <p>Have you, dear youth, your lamps trimmed and burning?</p>
