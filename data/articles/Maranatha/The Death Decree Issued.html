    <h1>Chap. 260—The Death Decree Issued</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he had power to ... cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
          killed. Revelation 13:15.</strong></p>
      <p>When Jesus leaves the most holy, His restraining Spirit is withdrawn from rulers and people. They are left to
          the control of evil angels. Then such laws will be made by the counsel and direction of Satan, that unless
          time should be very short, no ﬂesh could be saved.</p>
      <p>I saw that the four angels would hold the four winds until Jesus’ work was done in the sanctuary, and then will
          come the seven last plagues. These plagues enraged the wicked against the righteous; they thought that we had
          brought the judgments of God upon them, and that if they could rid the earth of us, the plagues would then be
          stayed. A decree went forth to slay the saints, which caused them to cry day and night for deliverance. This
          was the time of Jacob’s trouble.</p>
      <p>I saw the leading men of the earth consulting together, and Satan and his angels busy around them. I saw a
          writing, copies of which were scattered in different parts of the land, giving orders that unless the saints
          should yield their peculiar faith, give up the Sabbath, and observe the ﬁrst day of the week, the people were
          at liberty after a certain time to put them to death.</p>
      <p>Though a general decree has ﬁxed the time when commandment keepers may be put to death, their enemies will in
          some cases anticipate the decree, and before the time speciﬁed, will endeavor to take their lives. But none
          can pass the mighty guardians stationed about every faithful soul. Some are assailed in their ﬂight from the
          cities and villages; but the swords raised against them break and fall powerless as a straw. Others are
          defended by angels in the form of men of war.</p>
      <p>Could men see with heavenly vision, they would behold companies of angels that excel in strength stationed
          about those who have kept the word of Christ’s patience. With sympathizing tenderness, angels have witnessed
          their distress and have heard their prayers. They are waiting the word of their Commander to snatch them from
          their peril. But they must wait yet a little longer. The people of God must drink of the cup and be baptized
          with the baptism.</p>
