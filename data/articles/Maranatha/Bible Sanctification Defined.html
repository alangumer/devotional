    <h1>Chap. 82—Be Alert for Satan’s Devices</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
          he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith. 1 Peter 5:8, 9.</strong></p>
      <p>Let every soul be on the alert. The adversary is on your track. Be vigilant, watching diligently lest some
          carefully concealed and masterly snare shall take you unawares. Let the careless and indifferent beware lest
          the day of the Lord come upon them as a thief in the night. Many will wander from the path of humility, and,
          casting aside the yoke of Christ, will walk in strange paths. Blinded and bewildered, they will leave the
          narrow path that leads to the city of God....</p>
      <p>He who overcomes must watch; for, with worldly entanglements, error, and superstition, Satan strives to win
          Christ’s followers from Him. It is not enough that we avoid glaring dangers and perilous, inconsistent moves.
          We are to keep close to the side of Christ, walking in the path of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and sacriﬁce. We
          are in an enemy’s country. He who was cast out of heaven has come down with great power. With every
          conceivable artiﬁce and device he is seeking to take souls captive. Unless we are constantly on guard we shall
          fall an easy prey to his unnumbered deceptions.</p>
      <p>Everything is now clothed with a solemnity that all who believe the truth for this time should realize. They
          should act in reference to the day of God. The judgments of God are about to fall upon the world, and we need
          to be preparing for that great day.</p>
      <p>Our time is precious. We have but few, very few days of probation in which to make ready for the future,
          immortal life. We have no time to spend in haphazard movements. We should fear to skim the surface of the word
          of God.</p>
      <p>If your whole interest is in the truth and the preparatory work for this time you will be sanctiﬁed through the
          truth and receive a ﬁtness for immortality.... The</p>
      <p>thorough work of preparation must go on with all who profess the truth, until we stand before the throne of God
          without fault, without a spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. God will cleanse you if you will submit to the
          purifying process.</p>
