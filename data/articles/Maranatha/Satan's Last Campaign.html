    <h1>Chap. 56—Satan’s Last Campaign</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are
          there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 1 John 2:18.</strong></p>
      <p>The enemy is preparing for his last campaign against the church. He has so concealed himself from view that
          many can hardly believe that he exists, much less can they be convinced of his amazing activity and
          power....</p>
      <p>Man is Satan’s captive and is naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding. He has in
          himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in him by living faith
          ... that man may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only
          through Christ that Satan’s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is
          busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the
          earnest prayer of faith will bafﬂe his strongest efforts....</p>
      <p>Satan hopes to involve the remnant people of God in the general ruin that is coming upon the earth. As the
          coming of Christ draws nigh, he will be more determined and decisive in his efforts to overthrow them. Men and
          women will arise professing to have some new light or some new revelation whose tendency is to unsettle faith
          in the old landmarks. Their doctrines will not bear the test of God’s word, yet souls will be deceived. False
          reports will be circulated, and some will be taken in this snare.... We cannot be too watchful against every
          form of error, for</p>
      <p>Satan is constantly seeking to draw men from the truth....</p>
      <p>Some men have no ﬁrmness of character. They are like a ball of putty and can be pressed into any conceivable
          shape.... This weakness, indecision, and inefﬁciency</p>
      <p>must be overcome. There is an indomitableness about true Christian character which cannot be molded or subdued
          by adverse circumstances. Men must have moral backbone, an integrity which cannot be ﬂattered, bribed, or
          terriﬁed....</p>
      <p>God has set bounds that Satan cannot pass. Our most holy faith is this barrier; and if we build ourselves up in
          the faith, we shall be safe in the keeping of the Mighty One.</p>
