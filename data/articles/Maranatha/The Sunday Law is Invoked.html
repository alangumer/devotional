    <h1>Chap. 178—The Sunday Law is Invoked</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. Matthew 24:9.</strong></p>
      <p>As the movement for Sunday enforcement becomes more bold and decided, the law will be invoked against
          commandment keepers. They will be threatened with ﬁnes and imprisonment, and some will be offered positions of
          inﬂuence, and other rewards and advantages, as inducements to renounce their faith. But their steadfast answer
          is: “Show us from the word of God our error.” ... Those who are arraigned before the courts make a strong
          vindication of the truth, and some who hear them are led to take their stand to keep all the commandments of
          God. Thus light will be brought before thousands who otherwise would know nothing of these truths.</p>
      <p>Conscientious obedience to the word of God will be treated as rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will
          exercise harshness and severity toward the believing child; the master or mistress will oppress the
          <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> servant. Affection will be alienated; children will be disinherited and
          driven from home. The words of Paul will be literally fulﬁlled: “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
          shall suffer persecution.” 2 Timothy 3:12. As the defenders of truth refuse to honor the
          <nobr>Sunday-sabbath,</nobr> some of them will be thrust into prison, some will be exiled, some will be
          treated as slaves....</p>
      <p>In this time of persecution the faith of the Lord’s servants will be tried. They have faithfully given the
          warning, looking to God and to His word alone. God’s Spirit, moving upon their hearts, has constrained them to
          speak.... Yet when</p>
      <p>the storm of opposition and reproach bursts upon them, some, overwhelmed with consternation, will be ready to
          exclaim: “Had we foreseen the consequences of our words, we would have held our peace.” They are hedged in
          with difﬁculties. Satan assails them with ﬁerce temptations. The work which they have undertaken seems far
          beyond their ability to accomplish. They are threatened with destruction. The enthusiasm which animated them
          is gone; yet they cannot turn back. Then, feeling their utter helplessness, they ﬂee to the Mighty One for
          strength.</p>
