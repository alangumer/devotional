    <h1>Chap. 246—Prepare to Meet Thy God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy
          God, O Israel. Amos 4:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Many do not realize what they must be in order to live in the sight of the Lord without a high priest in the
          sanctuary through the time of trouble. Those who receive the seal of the living God and are protected in the
          time of trouble must reﬂect the image of Jesus fully.</p>
      <p>Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be puriﬁed from sin by the blood of sprinkling. Through the
          grace of God and their own diligent effort, they must be conquerors in the battle with evil. While the
          investigative judgment is going forward in heaven, while the sins of penitent believers are being removed from
          the sanctuary, there is to be a special work of puriﬁcation, of putting away of sin, among God’s people upon
          earth.</p>
      <p>I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful and were looking to the time of “refreshing” and the
          “latter rain” to ﬁt them to stand in the day of the Lord and to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the
          time of trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation; therefore they could not
          receive the refreshing that all must have to ﬁt them to live in the sight of a holy God.</p>
      <p>Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets and fail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth, and who
          are willing to believe that their condition is far better than it really is, will come up to the time of the
          falling of the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for the building....</p>
      <p>I saw that none could share the “refreshing” unless they obtain the victory over every besetment, over pride,
          selﬁshness, love of the world, and over every wrong word and action. We should, therefore, be drawing nearer
          and nearer to the Lord and be earnestly seeking that preparation necessary to enable us to stand in the battle
          in the day of the Lord. Let all remember that God is holy and that none but holy beings can ever dwell in His
          presence.</p>
