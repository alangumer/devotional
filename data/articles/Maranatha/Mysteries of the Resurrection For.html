    <h1>Chap. 293—Mysteries of the Resurrection For</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though
          after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my ﬂesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine
          eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. Job
          <nobr>19:25-27.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Our personal identity is preserved in the resurrection, though not the same particles of matter or material
          substance as went into the grave. The wondrous works of God are a mystery to man. The spirit, the character of
          man, is returned to God, there to be preserved. In the resurrection every man will have his own character. God
          in His own time will call forth the dead, giving again the breath of life, and bidding the dry bones live. The
          same form will come forth, but it will be free from disease and every defect. It lives again bearing the same
          individuality of features, so that friend will recognize friend. There is no law of God in nature which shows
          that God gives back the same identical particles of matter which composed the body before death. God shall
          give the righteous dead a body that will please Him.</p>
      <p>Paul illustrates this subject by the kernel of grain sown in the ﬁeld. The planted kernel decays, but there
          comes forth a new kernel. The natural substance in the grain that decays is never raised as before, but God
          giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him. A much ﬁner material will compose the human body, for it is a new
          creation, a new birth. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.</p>
      <p>He [the believer] may die, as Christ died, but the life of the Saviour is in him. His life is hid with Christ
          in God. “I am come that they might have life,” Jesus said, “and that they might have it more abundantly.” He
          carries on the great process by which believers are made one with Him in this present life, to be one with Him
          throughout all eternity....</p>
      <p>At the last day He will raise them as a part of Himself.... Christ became one</p>
      <p>with us in order that we might become one with Him in divinity.</p>
