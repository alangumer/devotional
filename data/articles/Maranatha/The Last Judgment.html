    <h1>Chap. 331—The Last Judgment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened:</strong></p>
      <p>... and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
          Revelation 20:12.</p>
      <p>Now Christ again appears to the view of His enemies. Far above the city, upon a foundation of burnished gold,
          is a throne, high and lifted up. Upon this throne sits the Son of God, and around Him are the subjects of His
          kingdom. The power and majesty of Christ no language can describe, no pen portray. The glory of the Eternal
          Father is enshrouding His Son. The brightness of His presence ﬁlls the City of God, and ﬂows out beyond the
          gates, ﬂooding the whole earth with its radiance.</p>
      <p>Nearest the throne are those who were once zealous in the cause of Satan, but who, plucked as brands from the
          burning, have followed their Saviour with deep, intense devotion. Next are those who perfected Christian
          characters in the midst of falsehood and inﬁdelity, those who honored the law of God when the Christian world
          declared it void, and the millions, of all ages, who were martyred for their faith. And beyond is the “great
          multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, ... before the
          throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.” Revelation 7:9....</p>
      <p>The redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and reechoes through the vaults of heaven: “Salvation to our
          God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” Verse 10. And angel and seraph unite their voices in
          adoration....</p>
      <p>In the presence of the assembled inhabitants of earth and heaven the ﬁnal coronation of the Son of God takes
          place. And now, invested with supreme majesty and power, the King of kings pronounces sentence upon the rebels
          against His government and executes justice upon those who have transgressed His law and oppressed His
          people....</p>
      <p>As soon as the books of record are opened, and the eye of Jesus looks upon the wicked, they are conscious of
          every sin which they have ever committed.</p>
