    <h1>Chap. 84—Why Probation Lingers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to
          <nobr>us-ward,</nobr> not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter
          3:9.</strong></p>
      <p>I was shown our danger, as a people, of becoming assimilated to the world rather than to the image of Christ.
          We are now upon the very borders of the eternal world, but it is the purpose of the adversary of souls to lead
          us to put far off the close of time. Satan will in every conceivable manner assail those who profess to be the
          <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people of God and to be waiting for the second appearing of our Saviour in
          the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. He will lead as many as possible to put off the evil day and
          become in spirit like the world, imitating its customs. I felt alarmed as I saw that the spirit of the world
          was controlling the hearts and minds of many who make a high profession of the truth....</p>
      <p>In consideration of the shortness of time we as a people should watch and pray, and in no case allow ourselves
          to be diverted from the solemn work of preparation for the great event before us. Because the time is
          apparently extended, many have become careless and indifferent in regard to their words and actions. They do
          not realize their danger and do not see and understand the mercy of our God in lengthening their probation,
          that they may have time to form characters for the future, immortal life. Every moment is of the highest
          value. Time is granted them, not to be employed in studying their own ease and becoming dwellers on the earth,
          but to be used in the work of overcoming every defect in their own characters and in helping others, by
          example and personal effort, to see the beauty of holiness. God has a people upon the earth who in faith and
          holy hope are tracing down the roll of <nobr>fast-fulﬁlling</nobr> prophecy and are seeking to purify their
          souls by obeying the truth, that they may not be found without the wedding garment when Christ shall
          appear....</p>
      <p>The signs foretold in prophecy are fast fulﬁlling around us. This should arouse every true follower of Christ
          to zealous action.</p>
