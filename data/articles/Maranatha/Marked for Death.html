    <h1>Chap. 261—Marked for Death</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to
          perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day. Esther 3:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The decree that will ﬁnally go forth against the remnant people of God will be very similar to that issued by
          Ahasuerus against the Jews.</p>
      <p>When the protection of human laws shall be withdrawn from those who honor the law of God, there will be, in
          different lands, a simultaneous movement for their destruction. As the time appointed in the decree draws
          near, the people will conspire to root out the hated sect. It will be determined to strike in one night a
          decisive blow, which shall utterly silence the voice of dissent and reproof.</p>
      <p>The decree will go forth that they must disregard the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and honor the ﬁrst
          day, or lose their lives; but they will not yield, and trample under their feet the Sabbath of the Lord, and
          honor an institution of papacy. Satan’s host and wicked men will surround them, and exult over them, because
          there will seem to be no way of escape for them.</p>
      <p>When this time of trouble comes, every case is decided; there is no longer probation, no longer mercy for the
          impenitent. The seal of the living God is upon His people. This small remnant, unable to defend themselves in
          the deadly conﬂict with the powers of earth that are marshaled by the dragon host, make God their defense. The
          decree has been passed by the highest earthly authority that they shall worship the beast and receive his mark
          under pain of persecution and death.</p>
      <p>I saw the saints suffering great mental anguish. They seemed to be surrounded by the wicked inhabitants of the
          earth. Every appearance was against them. Some began to fear that God had at last left them to perish by the
          hand of the wicked....</p>
      <p>It was an hour of fearful, terrible agony to the saints. Day and night they cried unto God for deliverance. To
          outward appearance, there was no possibility of their escape. The wicked had already begun to triumph, crying
          out, “Why doesn’t your God deliver you out of our hands? Why don’t you go up and save your lives?” But the
          saints heeded them not.</p>
