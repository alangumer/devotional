    <h1>Chap. 286—The Wicked Slay Each Other</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword
          shall be against his brother. Ezekiel 38:21.</strong></p>
      <p>The wicked are ﬁlled with regret, not because of their sinful neglect of God and their fellow men, but because
          God has conquered. They lament that the result is what it is; but they do not repent of their wickedness. They
          would leave no means untried to conquer if they could....</p>
      <p>Ministers and people see that they have not sustained the right relation to God. They see that they have
          rebelled against the Author of all just and righteous law. The setting aside of the divine precepts gave rise
          to thousands of springs of evil, discord, hatred, iniquity, until the earth became one vast ﬁeld of strife,
          one sink of corruption. This is the view that now appears to those who rejected truth and chose to cherish
          error. No language can express the longing which the disobedient and disloyal feel for that which they have
          lost <nobr>forever—eternal</nobr> life. Men whom the world has worshiped for their talents and eloquence now
          see these things in their true light. They realize what they have forfeited by transgression, and they fall at
          the feet of those whose ﬁdelity they have despised and derided, and confess that God has loved them.</p>
      <p>The people see that they have been deluded. They accuse one another of having led them to destruction; but all
          unite in heaping their bitterest condemnation upon the ministers. Unfaithful pastors have prophesied smooth
          things; they have led their hearers to make void the law of God and to persecute those who would keep it holy.
          Now, in their despair, these teachers confess before the world their work of deception. The multitudes are
          ﬁlled with fury. “We are lost!” they cry, “and you are the cause of our ruin”; and they turn upon the false
          shepherds. The very ones that once admired them most will pronounce the most dreadful curses upon them. The
          very hands that once crowned them with laurels will be raised for their destruction. The swords which were to
          slay God’s people are now employed to destroy their enemies. Everywhere there is strife and bloodshed.</p>
