    <h1>Chap. 40—Any Idols Here?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. 1 John 5:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Every true child of God will be sifted as wheat, and in the sifting process every cherished pleasure which
          diverts the mind from God must be sacriﬁced. In many families the mantel shelves, stands, and tables are ﬁlled
          with ornaments and pictures.... Thus the thoughts, which should be upon God and heavenly interests,</p>
      <p>are brought down to common things. Is not this a species of idolatry? Should not the money thus spent have been
          used to bless humanity, to relieve the suffering, to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry? Should it not
          be placed in the Lord’s treasury to advance His cause and build up His kingdom in the earth?</p>
      <p>This matter is of great importance, and it is urged upon you to save you from the sin of idolatry. Blessing
          would come to your souls if you would obey the word spoken by the Holy One of Israel, “Thou shalt have no
          other gods before me.” Many are creating unnecessary cares and anxieties for themselves by devoting time and
          thought to the unnecessary ornaments with which their houses are ﬁlled. The power of God is needed to arouse
          them from this devotion; for to all intents and purposes it is idolatry.</p>
      <p>He who searches the heart, desires to win His people from every species of idolatry. Let the Word of God, the
          blessed book of life, occupy the tables now ﬁlled with useless ornaments. Spend your money in buying books
          that will be the means of enlightening the mind in regard to present truth.... Grasp the Word of the Lord</p>
      <p>as the treasure of inﬁnite wisdom and love; this is the Guidebook that points out the path to heaven....</p>
      <p>O that you would search the Scriptures with prayerful hearts, and a spirit of surrender to God! O that you
          would search your hearts as with a lighted candle, and discover and break the ﬁnest thread that binds you to
          worldly habits, which divert the mind from God! Plead with God to show you every practice that draws your
          thoughts and affections from Him. God has given His holy law to man as His measure of character. By this law
          you may see and overcome every defect in your character. You may sever yourself from every idol, and link
          yourself to the throne of God by the golden chain of grace and truth.</p>
