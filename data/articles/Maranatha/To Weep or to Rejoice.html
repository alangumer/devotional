    <h1>Chap. 31—To Weep or to Rejoice?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. Jeremiah 8:20. I appeal to the members
          of our churches not to disregard the fulﬁlling of the signs of the times, which say so plainly that the end is
          near. O, how many who have not cared for the salvation of their souls will soon make the bitter lamentation,
          “The</strong></p>
      <p>harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved!”</p>
      <p>O, that we would remember that it is court week with us, and that our cases are pending! Now is the time to
          watch and pray, to put away all <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> all pride, all selﬁshness. The precious moments
          that are now by many worse than wasted should be spent in meditation and prayer. Many of those who profess to
          be keeping the commandments of God are following inclination instead of duty. As they are now, they are
          unworthy of eternal life. To these careless, indifferent ones, I would say, Your vain thoughts, your unkind
          words, your selﬁsh acts, are recorded in the book of heaven. The angels that were present at Belshazzar’s
          idolatrous revelry stand beside you as you dishonor your Redeemer. Sadly they turn away, grieved that you
          should thus crucify Him afresh, and put Him to open shame....</p>
      <p>On Christ’s coronation day He will not acknowledge as His any who bear spot or wrinkle or any such thing. But
          to His faithful ones He will give crowns of immortal glory. Those who would not that He should reign over them
          will see Him surrounded by the army of the redeemed, each of whom bears the sign, The Lord Our Righteousness.
          They will see the head once crowned with thorns crowned with a diadem of glory.</p>
      <p>In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and His Son. The angels of heaven,
          touching their golden harps, will welcome the King, and those who are the trophies of His
          <nobr>victory—those</nobr> who have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph
          will peal forth, ﬁlling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts accompanied by His
          redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of suffering and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> has not been in
          vain.</p>
