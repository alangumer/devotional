    <h1>Chap. 208—National Ruin Follows National Apostasy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The earth also is deﬁled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws,
          changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Isaiah 24:5.</strong></p>
      <p>The people of the United States have been a favored people; but when they restrict religious liberty, surrender
          Protestantism, and give countenance to popery, the measure of their guilt will be full, and “national
          apostasy” will be registered in the books of heaven. The result of this apostasy will be national ruin.</p>
      <p>By the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy in violation of the law of God, our nation will
          disconnect herself fully from righteousness. When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to
          grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism, when,
          under the inﬂuence of this threefold union, our country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as
          a Protestant and republican government, and shall make provision for the propagation of papal falsehoods and
          delusions, then we may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan and that the end is
          near.</p>
      <p>Through spiritualism, Satan appears as a benefactor of the race, healing the diseases of the people, and
          professing to present a new and more exalted system of religious faith; but at the same time he works as a
          destroyer....</p>
      <p>While appearing to the children of men as a great physician who can heal all their maladies, he will bring
          disease and disaster, until populous cities are reduced to ruin and desolation....</p>
      <p>And then the great deceiver will persuade men that those who serve God are causing these evils.</p>
      <p>As men depart further and further from God, Satan is permitted to have power over the children of disobedience.
          He hurls destruction among men. There is calamity by land and sea. Property and life are destroyed by ﬁre and
          ﬂood. Satan resolves to charge this upon those who refuse to bow to the idol which he has set up. His agents
          point to <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists as the cause of the trouble. “These people stand out in deﬁance
          of law,” they say. “They desecrate Sunday. Were they compelled to obey the law for Sunday observance, there
          would be a cessation of these terrible judgments.”</p>
