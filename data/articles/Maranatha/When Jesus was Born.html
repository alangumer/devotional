    <h1>Chap. 3—When Jesus was Born</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When Jesus was born in Bethlehem...there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he
          that is born King of the Jews? Matthew 2:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The King of glory stooped low to take humanity; and angels, who had witnessed His splendor in the heavenly
          courts, as He was worshiped by all the heavenly hosts, were disappointed to ﬁnd their divine Commander in a
          position of so great humiliation.</p>
      <p>The Jews had separated themselves so far from God by their wicked works, that angels could not communicate to
          them the tidings of the advent of the infant Redeemer. God chooses the wise men of the East to do His
          will....</p>
      <p>These wise men had seen the heavens illuminated with light, which enshrouded the heavenly host who heralded the
          advent of Christ to the humble shepherds....</p>
      <p>This light was a distant cluster of ﬂaming angels, which appeared like a luminous star. The unusual appearance
          of the large bright star, which they had never seen before, hanging as a sign in the heavens, attracted their
          attention....The</p>
      <p>wise men directed their course where the star seemed to lead them. And as they drew nigh to the city of
          Jerusalem, the star was enshrouded in darkness, and no longer guided them. They reasoned that the Jews could
          not be ignorant of the great event of the advent of the Messiah, and they made inquiries in the vicinity of
          Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>The wise men are surprised to see no unusual interest upon the subject of the coming of the Messiah....They
          marvel that the Jews are not interested and joyful in</p>
      <p>prospect of this great event of the advent of Christ.</p>
      <p>The churches of our time are seeking worldly aggrandizement, and are as unwilling to see the light of the
          prophecies, and receive the evidences of their fulﬁllment which show that Christ is soon to come, as were the
          Jews in reference to His ﬁrst appearing. They were looking for the temporal and triumphant reign of Messiah in
          Jerusalem. Professed Christians of our time are expecting the temporal prosperity of the church, in the
          conversion of the world, and the enjoyment of the temporal millennium.</p>
