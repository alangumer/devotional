    <h1>Chap. 257—A Time of Trouble Such as Never Was</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy
          people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same
          time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
          Daniel 12:1.</strong></p>
      <p>When the third angel’s message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The
          people of God have accomplished their work. They have received “the latter rain,” “the ... refreshing ... from
          the presence of the Lord,” and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening to and
          fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done; the ﬁnal test has been
          brought upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received “the
          seal of the living God.” Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and
          with a loud voice says, “It is done.” ...</p>
      <p>When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous
          must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint which has been upon the wicked is
          removed, and Satan has entire control of the ﬁnally impenitent. God’s <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> has ended.
          The world has rejected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed the
          boundary of their probation; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at last withdrawn. Unsheltered
          by divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one. Satan will then plunge the inhabitants of the
          earth into one great, ﬁnal trouble. As the angels of God cease to hold in check the ﬁerce winds of human
          passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose. The whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible
          than that which came upon Jerusalem of old.</p>
      <p>Those only who have clean hands and pure hearts will stand in that trying time....</p>
      <p>Now is the time, while the four angels are holding the four winds, to make our calling and election sure.</p>
