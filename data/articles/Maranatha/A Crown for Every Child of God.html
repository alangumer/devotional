    <h1>Chap. 302—A Crown for Every Child of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
          which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. James 1:12.</strong></p>
      <p>I saw a very great number of angels bring from the city glorious <nobr>crowns—a</nobr> crown for every saint,
          with his name written thereon. As Jesus called for the crowns, angels presented them to Him, and with His own
          right hand the lovely Jesus placed the crowns on the heads of the saints. In the same manner the angels
          brought the harps, and Jesus presented them also to the saints. The commanding angels ﬁrst struck the note,
          and then every voice was raised in grateful, happy praise, and every hand skillfully swept over the strings of
          the harp, sending forth melodious music in rich and perfect strains....</p>
      <p>Within the city there was everything to feast the eye. Rich glory they beheld everywhere. Then Jesus looked
          upon His redeemed saints; their countenances were radiant with glory; and as He ﬁxed His loving eyes upon
          them, He said, with His rich, musical voice, “I behold the travail of My soul, and am satisﬁed. This rich
          glory is yours to enjoy eternally. Your sorrows are ended. There shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
          crying, neither shall there be any more pain.” ...</p>
      <p>I then saw Jesus leading His people to the tree of life.... Upon the tree of life</p>
      <p>was most beautiful fruit, of which the saints could partake freely; in the city was a most glorious throne,
          from which proceeded a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal. On each side of this river was the tree
          of life, and on the banks of the river were other beautiful trees bearing fruit....</p>
      <p>Language is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of heaven. As the scene rises before me, I am lost
          in amazement. Carried away with the surpassing splendor and excellent glory, I lay down the pen, and exclaim,
          “Oh, what love! what wondrous love!” The most exalted language fails to describe the glory of heaven or the
          matchless depths of a Saviour’s love.</p>
