    <h1>Chap. 91—Greatest Work in the World</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. Mark 16:15. “Go ye into all the
          world, and preach the gospel to every creature,” is Christ’s</strong></p>
      <p>command to His followers. Not that all are called to be ministers or missionaries in the ordinary sense of the
          term; but all may be workers with Him in giving the “glad tidings” to their fellow men. To all, great or
          small, learned or ignorant, old or young, the command is given.</p>
      <p>Upon every one who knows the truth for this time rests the responsibility of making it known to others. The
          servants of Christ are in a large measure responsible for the <nobr>well-being</nobr> and the salvation of the
          world. They are to be <nobr>co-laborers</nobr> with God in the work of winning souls to Christ.</p>
      <p>The theme that attracts the heart of the sinner is Christ, and Him cruciﬁed. On the cross of Calvary, Jesus
          stands revealed to the world in unparalleled love. Present Him thus to the hungering multitudes, and the light
          of His love will win men from darkness to light, from transgression to obedience and true holiness. Beholding
          Jesus upon the cross of Calvary arouses the conscience to the heinous character of sin as nothing else can
          do.</p>
      <p>Will not our church members keep their eyes ﬁxed on a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour, in whom their hopes of
          eternal life are centered? This is our message, our argument, our doctrine, our warning to the impenitent, our
          encouragement for the sorrowing, the hope for every believer. If we can awaken an interest in men’s minds that
          will cause them to ﬁx their eyes on Christ, we may step aside, and ask them only to continue to ﬁx their eyes
          upon the Lamb of God.... He whose eyes are</p>
      <p>ﬁxed on Jesus will leave all. He will die to selﬁshness. He will believe in all the Word of God, which is so
          gloriously and wonderfully exalted in Christ.</p>
      <p>It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten the coming of our Lord Jesus
          Christ. Were all who profess His name bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown
          with the seed of the gospel. Quickly the last harvest would be ripened, and Christ would come to gather the
          precious grain.</p>
