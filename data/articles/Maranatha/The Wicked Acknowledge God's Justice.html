    <h1>Chap. 337—The Wicked Acknowledge God’s Justice</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord,
          every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. Romans 14:10, 11.</strong></p>
      <p>As if entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of the Son of God. They see in His hands the tables
          of the divine law, the statutes which they have despised and transgressed. They witness the outburst of
          wonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved; and as the wave of melody sweeps over the multitudes without
          the city, all with one voice exclaim, “Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are
          thy ways, thou King of saints” (Revelation 15:3); and, falling prostrate, they worship the Prince of
          life.</p>
      <p>Satan seems paralyzed as he beholds the glory and majesty of Christ. He who was once a covering cherub
          remembers whence he has fallen. A shining seraph, “son of the morning;” how changed, how degraded! From the
          council where once he was honored, he is forever excluded. He sees another now standing near to the Father,
          veiling His glory. He has seen the crown placed upon the head of Christ by an angel of lofty stature and
          majestic presence, and he knows that the exalted position of this angel might have been his.</p>
      <p>Memory recalls the home of his innocence and purity.... As Satan looks upon</p>
      <p>his kingdom, the fruit of his toil, he sees only failure and ruin....</p>
      <p>The time has now come when the rebellion is to be ﬁnally defeated and the history and character of Satan
          disclosed. In his last great effort to dethrone Christ, destroy His people, and take possession of the City of
          God, the archdeceiver has been fully unmasked. Those who have united with him see the total failure of his
          cause.... He is the object of universal abhorrence.</p>
      <p>Satan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unﬁtted him for heaven. He has trained his powers to war against
          God; the purity, peace, and harmony of heaven would be to him supreme torture. His accusations against the
          mercy and justice of God are now silenced. The reproach which he has endeavored to cast upon Jehovah rests
          wholly upon himself. And now Satan bows down and confesses the justice of his sentence.</p>
