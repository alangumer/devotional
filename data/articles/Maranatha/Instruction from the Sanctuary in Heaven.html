    <h1>Chap. 241—Instruction from the Sanctuary in Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
          conscience. Hebrews 10:22.</strong></p>
      <p>“And, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
          brought him near before him.” Daniel 7:13.... The</p>
      <p>coming of Christ here described is not His second coming to the earth. He comes to the Ancient of days in
          heaven to receive dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, which will be given Him at the close of His work as a
          mediator. It is this coming, and not His second advent to the earth, that was foretold in prophecy to take
          place at the termination of the 2300 days in 1844. Attended by heavenly angels, our great High Priest enters
          the holy of holies, and there appears in the presence of God ... to perform the work of investigative
          judgment, and to make an atonement for all who are shown to be entitled to its beneﬁts.</p>
      <p>May the Lord give us to see the need of drinking from the living fountain of the water of life. Its pure
          streams will refresh and heal us and refresh all connected with us. Oh, if the hearts were only subdued by the
          Spirit of God! If the eye were single to God’s glory, what a ﬂood of heavenly light would pour upon the soul.
          He who spake as never man spake was an educator upon earth. After His resurrection He was an educator to the
          lonely, disappointed disciples traveling to Emmaus, and to those assembled in the upper chamber. He opened to
          them the Scriptures concerning Himself and caused their hearts to bound with a holy, new and sacred hope and
          joy.</p>
      <p>From the Holy of Holies, there goes on the grand work of instruction. The angels of God are communicating to
          men. Christ ofﬁciates in the sanctuary. We do not follow Him into the sanctuary as we should. Christ and
          angels work in the hearts of the children of men. The church above united with the church below is warring the
          good warfare upon the earth. There must be a purifying of the soul here upon the earth, in harmony with
          Christ’s cleansing of the sanctuary in heaven.</p>
      <p>God’s people are now to have their eyes ﬁxed on the heavenly sanctuary, where</p>
      <p>... our great High Priest ... is interceding for His people.</p>
