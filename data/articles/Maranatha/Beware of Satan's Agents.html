    <h1>Chap. 51—Beware of Satan’s Agents</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving
          heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils. 1 Timothy 4:1.</strong></p>
      <p>After the passing of the time in 1844, we had fanaticism of every kind to meet....</p>
      <p>The experience of the past will be repeated. In the future Satan’s superstitions will assume new forms. Errors
          will be presented in a pleasing and ﬂattering manner. False theories, clothed with garments of light, will be
          presented to God’s people. Thus Satan will try to deceive, if possible, the very elect. Most seducing
          inﬂuences will be exerted; minds will be hypnotized.</p>
      <p>Corruptions of every type, similar to those existing among the antediluvians, will be brought in to take minds
          captive. The exaltation of nature as God, the unrestrained license of the human will, the counsel of the
          <nobr>ungodly—these</nobr> Satan uses as his agencies to bring about certain ends. He will employ the power of
          mind over mind to carry out his designs. The most sorrowful thought of all is that under his deceptive
          inﬂuence men will have a form of godliness, without having a real connection with God. Like Adam and Eve, who
          ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, many are even now feeding upon the deceptive
          morsels of error.</p>
      <p>Satanic agencies are clothing false theories in an attractive garb, even as Satan in the Garden of Eden
          concealed his identity from our ﬁrst parents by speaking through the serpent. These agencies are instilling
          into human minds that which in reality is deadly error. The hypnotic inﬂuence of Satan will rest upon those
          who turn from the plain word of God to pleasing fables.</p>
      <p>It is those who have had the most light that Satan most assiduously seeks to ensnare. He knows that if he can
          deceive them, they will, under his control, clothe sin with garments of righteousness, and lead many
          astray.</p>
      <p>I say to all: Be on your guard; for as an angel of light Satan is walking in every assembly of Christian
          workers, and in every church, trying to win the members to his side. I am bidden to give to the people of God
          the warning: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked.” Galatians 6:7.</p>
