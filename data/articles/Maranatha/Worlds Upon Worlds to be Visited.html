    <h1>Chap. 360—Worlds Upon Worlds to be Visited</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord.... I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all</strong></p>
      <p>their host have I commanded. Isaiah 45:11, 12.</p>
      <p>Many seem to have the idea that this world and the heavenly mansions constitute the universe of God. Not
          so.</p>
      <p>God has worlds upon worlds that are obedient to His law. These worlds are conducted with reference to the glory
          of the Creator. As the inhabitants of these worlds see the great price that has been paid to ransom man, they
          are ﬁlled with amazement.</p>
      <p>The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were given me, and an angel attended me from the city to a
          place that was bright and glorious. The grass of the place was living green, and the birds there warbled a
          sweet song. The inhabitants of the place were of all sizes; they were noble, majestic, and lovely. They bore
          the express image of Jesus, and their countenances beamed with holy joy, expressive of the freedom and
          happiness of the place.</p>
      <p>I asked one of them why they were so much more lovely than those on the earth. The reply was, “We have lived in
          strict obedience to the commandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience, like those on the earth.”
          Then I saw two trees, one looked much like the tree of life in the city. The fruit of both looked beautiful,
          but of one they could not eat. They had power to eat of both, but were forbidden to eat of one. Then my
          attending angel said to me, “None in this place have tasted of the forbidden tree; but if they should eat,
          they would fall.”</p>
      <p>Then I was taken to a world which had seven moons. There I saw good old Enoch, who had been translated.... I
          asked him if this was the place he was taken to</p>
      <p>from the earth. He said, “It is not; the city is my home, and I have come to visit this place.” He moved about
          the place as if perfectly at home.</p>
      <p>I begged of my attending angel to let me remain in that place. I could not bear the thought of coming back to
          this dark world again. Then the angel said, “You must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the 144,000,
          shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God.”</p>
