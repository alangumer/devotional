    <h1>Chap. 350—The Church Triumphant</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with ﬁre: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast,
          and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the
          harps of God. Revelation 15:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Now the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over to
          idolatry. But the day is coming when the battle will have been fought, the victory won. The will of God is to
          be done on earth as it is done in heaven. The nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of
          heaven. All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise and
          <nobr>thanksgiving—the</nobr> robe of Christ’s righteousness. All nature, in its surpassing loveliness, will
          offer to God a tribute of praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven. The light of
          the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater than it is now.
          The years will move on in gladness. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and the sons of God
          will shout for joy, while God and Christ will unite in proclaiming, “There shall be no more sin, neither shall
          there be any more death.”...</p>
      <p>Stand on the threshold of eternity and hear the gracious welcome given to those who in this life have
          <nobr>co-operated</nobr> with Christ, regarding it as a privilege and an honor to suffer for His sake. With
          the angels, they cast their crowns at the feet of the Redeemer, exclaiming, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
          to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.... Honour,</p>
      <p>and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.”
          Revelation 5:12, 13.</p>
      <p>There the redeemed ones greet those who directed them to the uplifted Saviour. They unite in praising Him who
          died that human beings might have the life that measures with the life of God. The conﬂict is over. All
          tribulation and strife are at an end. Songs of victory ﬁll all heaven, as the redeemed stand around the throne
          of God. All take up the joyful strain, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain” and hath redeemed us to God.</p>
