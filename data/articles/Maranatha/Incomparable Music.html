    <h1>Chap. 353—Incomparable Music</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their
          heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall ﬂee away. Isaiah 35:10.</strong></p>
      <p>There will be music there, and song, such music and song as, save in the visions of God, no mortal ear has
          heard or mind conceived.</p>
      <p>“As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there.” “They shall lift up their voice, they shall
          sing for the majesty of the Lord.” “For the Lord shall comfort Zion: ... He will make her wilderness like
          Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord: joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and
          the voice of melody.”</p>
      <p>I have been shown the order, the perfect order, of heaven, and have been enraptured as I listened to the
          perfect music there. After coming out of vision, the singing here has sounded very harsh and discordant. I
          have seen companies of angels, who stood in a hollow square, everyone having a harp of gold. At the end of the
          harp was an instrument to turn to set the harp or change the tunes. Their ﬁngers did not sweep over the
          strings carelessly, but they touched different strings to produce different sounds. There is one angel who
          always leads, who ﬁrst touches the harp and strikes the note, then all join in the rich, perfect music of
          heaven. It cannot be described. It is melody, heavenly, divine, while from every countenance beams the image
          of Jesus, shining with glory unspeakable.</p>
      <p>What a song that will be when the ransomed of the Lord meet ...! All heaven is ﬁlled with rich music, and with
          songs of praise to the Lamb. Saved, everlastingly saved, in the kingdom of glory! To have a life that measures
          with the life of <nobr>God—that</nobr> is the reward.</p>
      <p>Language is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of heaven. As the scene rises before me, I am lost
          in amazement. Carried away with the surpassing splendor and excellent glory, I lay down the pen, and exclaim,
          “Oh, what love! what wondrous love!” The most exalted language fails to describe the glory of heaven or the
          matchless depths of a Saviour’s love.</p>
