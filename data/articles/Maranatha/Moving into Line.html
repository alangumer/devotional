    <h1>Chap. 151—Moving into Line</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. Psalm
          69:32.</strong></p>
      <p>It is your privilege to be glad in the Lord, and to rejoice in the knowledge of His sustaining grace. Let His
          love take possession of mind and heart. Guard against becoming overwearied, careworn, depressed. Bear an
          uplifting testimony. Turn your eyes away from that which is dark and discouraging, and behold Jesus, our great
          Leader, under whose watchful supervision the cause of present truth, to which we are giving our lives and our
          all, is destined to triumph gloriously....</p>
      <p>Oh, let it be seen ... that Jesus is abiding in the heart, sustaining, strengthening, comforting. It is your
          privilege to be endowed, from day to day, with a rich measure of His Holy Spirit, and to have broadened views
          of the importance and scope of the message we are proclaiming to the world. The Lord is willing to reveal to
          you wondrous things out of His law. Wait before Him with humility of heart. Pray most earnestly for an
          understanding of the times in which we live, for a fuller conception of His purpose, and for increased
          efﬁciency in soulsaving....</p>
      <p>It will be well for us to consider what is soon to come upon the earth. This is no time for triﬂing or
          <nobr>self-seeking.</nobr> If the times in which we are living fail to impress our minds seriously, what can
          reach us? ...</p>
      <p>Men of clear understanding are needed now. God calls upon those who are willing to be controlled by the Holy
          Spirit to lead out in a work of thorough reformation. I see a crisis before us, and the Lord calls for His
          laborers to come into line. Every soul should now stand in a position of deeper, truer consecration to God
          than during the years that have passed....</p>
      <p>I have been deeply impressed by scenes that have recently passed before me in the night season. There seemed to
          be a great <nobr>movement—a</nobr> work of <nobr>revival—going</nobr> forward in many places. Our people were
          moving into line, responding to God’s call.... Shall we not heed His voice? Shall we not trim our lamps, and
          act like men</p>
      <p>who look for their Lord to come? The time is one that calls for light bearing, for action.</p>
