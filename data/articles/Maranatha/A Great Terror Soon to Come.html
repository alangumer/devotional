    <h1>Chap. 130—A Great Terror Soon to Come</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We are put on view to the world, and to angels, and to men. 1 Corinthians 4:9, Bible in Basic
          English.</strong></p>
      <p>The world is a theater; the actors, its inhabitants, are preparing to act their part in the last great drama.
          With the great masses of mankind there is no unity, except as men confederate to accomplish their selﬁsh
          purposes. God is looking on. His purposes in regard to His rebellious subjects will be fulﬁlled. The world has
          not been given into the hands of men, though God is permitting the elements of confusion and disorder to bear
          sway for a season. A power from beneath is working to bring about the last great scenes in the
          <nobr>drama—Satan</nobr> coming as Christ, and working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in those who
          are binding themselves together in secret societies. Those who are yielding to the passion for confederation
          are working out the plans of the enemy. The cause will be followed by the effect.</p>
      <p>Transgression has almost reached its limit. Confusion ﬁlls the world, and a great terror is soon to come upon
          human beings. The end is very near. We who know the truth should be preparing for what is soon to break upon
          the world as an overwhelming surprise....</p>
      <p>Are we as a people asleep? Oh, if the young men and young women in our institutions who are now unready for the
          Lord’s appearing, unﬁtted to become members of the Lord’s family, could only discern the signs of the times,
          what a change would be seen in them! The Lord Jesus is calling for <nobr>self-denying</nobr> workers to follow
          in His footsteps, to walk and work for Him, to lift the cross, and to follow where He leads the way.</p>
      <p>Many are readily satisﬁed with offering the Lord triﬂing acts of service. Their Christianity is feeble. Christ
          gave Himself for sinners. With what anxiety for the salvation of souls we should be ﬁlled as we see human
          beings perishing in sin! These souls have been bought at an inﬁnite price. The death of the Son of God on
          Calvary’s cross is the measure of their value. Day by day they are deciding whether they will have eternal
          life or eternal death.</p>
