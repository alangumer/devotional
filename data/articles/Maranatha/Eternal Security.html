    <h1>Chap. 364—Eternal Security</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.
          Zechariah 14:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back the world into God’s favor. All that was lost by
          sin is restored. Not only man but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the obedient. For six
          thousand years Satan has struggled to maintain possession of the earth. Now God’s original purpose in its
          creation is accomplished. “The saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for
          ever, even for ever and ever” (Daniel 7:18).</p>
      <p>“From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord’s name is to be praised” (Psalm 113:3).
          “In that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.” “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth”
          (Zechariah 14:9).... “All</p>
      <p>His commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever” (Psalm 111:7, 8). The sacred statutes which Satan
          has hated and sought to destroy, will be honored throughout a sinless universe.</p>
      <p>Through Christ’s redeeming work the government of God stands justiﬁed. The Omnipotent One is made known as the
          God of love. Satan’s charges are refuted, and his character unveiled. Rebellion can never again arise. Sin can
          never again enter the universe. Through eternal ages all are secure from apostasy. By love’s
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> the inhabitants of earth and heaven are bound to their Creator in bonds of
          indissoluble union....</p>
      <p>In the place where sin abounded, God’s grace much more abounds. The earth itself, the very ﬁeld that Satan
          claims as his, is to be not only ransomed but exalted. Our little world, under the curse of sin the one dark
          blot in His glorious creation, will be honored above all other worlds in the universe of God. Here, where the
          Son of God tabernacled in humanity; where the King of glory lived and suffered and <nobr>died—here,</nobr>
          when He shall make all things new, the tabernacle of God shall be with men, “and he will dwell with them, and
          they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” And through endless ages as
          the redeemed walk in the light of the Lord, they will praise Him for His unspeakable
          <nobr>Gift—Immanuel,</nobr> “God with us.”</p>
