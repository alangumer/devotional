    <h1>Chap. 134—Prejudice on the Increase</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed from death unto life,
          because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 1 John 3:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>He who is closely connected with Christ is lifted above the prejudice of color or caste. His faith takes hold
          of eternal realities. The divine Author of truth is to be uplifted. Our hearts are to be ﬁlled with the faith
          that works by love and puriﬁes the soul. The work of the good Samaritan is the example that we are to
          follow.</p>
      <p>It will be impossible to adjust all matters regarding the color question in accordance with the Lord’s order
          until those who believe the truth are so closely united with Christ that they are one with Him. Both the white
          and the colored members of our churches need to be converted. There are some of both classes who are
          unreasonable, and when the color question is agitated, they manifest unsanctiﬁed, unconverted traits of
          character. Quarrelsome elements are easily aroused in those who, because they have never learned to wear the
          yoke of Christ, are opinionated and obstinate. In such, self clamors with an unsanctiﬁed determination for the
          supremacy.</p>
      <p>As time advances, and race prejudices increase, it will become almost impossible, in many places, for white
          workers to labor for the colored people. Sometimes the white people who are not in sympathy with our work will
          unite with colored people to oppose it, claiming that our teaching is an effort to break up churches and bring
          in trouble over the Sabbath question. White ministers and colored ministers will make false statements,
          arousing in the minds of the people such a feeling of antagonism that they will be ready to destroy and to
          kill.</p>
      <p>The powers of hell are working with all their ingenuity to prevent the proclamation of the last message of
          mercy among the colored people. Satan is working to make it most difﬁcult for the gospel minister and teacher
          to ignore the prejudice that exists between the white and the colored people.</p>
      <p>Let us follow the course of wisdom. Let us do nothing that will unnecessarily arouse
          <nobr>opposition—nothing</nobr> that will hinder the proclamation of the gospel message.</p>
