    <h1>Chap. 243—The Investigative Judgment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. 1
          Timothy 5:24.</strong></p>
      <p>The work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sins is to be accomplished before the second
          advent of the Lord. Since the dead are to be judged out of the things written in the books, it is impossible
          that the sins of men should be blotted out until after the judgment at which their cases are to be
          investigated....</p>
      <p>When the investigative judgment closes, Christ will come, and His reward will be with Him to give to every man
          as his work shall be.</p>
      <p>All are to be judged according to the things written in the books, and to be rewarded as their works have been.
          This judgment does not take place at death.</p>
      <p>In the typical service the high priest, having made the atonement for Israel, came forth and blessed the
          congregation. So Christ, at the close of His work as mediator, will appear, “without sin unto salvation,” to
          bless His waiting people with eternal life. As the priest, in removing the sins from the sanctuary, confessed
          them upon the head of the scapegoat, so Christ will place all these sins upon Satan, the originator and
          instigator of sin. The scapegoat, bearing the sins of Israel, was sent away “unto a land not inhabited;” so
          Satan, bearing the guilt of all the sins which he has caused God’s people to commit, will be for a thousand
          years conﬁned to the earth, which will then be desolate, without inhabitant, and he will at last suffer the
          full penalty of sin in the ﬁres that shall destroy all the wicked.</p>
      <p>A few, yes, only a few, of the vast number who people the earth will be saved unto life eternal, while the
          masses who have not perfected their souls in obeying the truth will be appointed to the second death.</p>
      <p>While the sins of penitent believers are being removed from the sanctuary, there is to be a special work of
          puriﬁcation, of putting away of sin, among God’s people upon earth.</p>
