    <h1>Chap. 115—Why so Many Idlers?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth. Acts
          1:8, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>In the trust given to the ﬁrst disciples, believers in every age have shared. Everyone who has received the
          gospel has been given sacred truth to impart to the world. God’s faithful people have always been aggressive
          missionaries, consecrating their resources to the honor of His name, and wisely using their talents in His
          service....</p>
      <p>The members of God’s church are to be zealous of good works, separating from worldly ambition, and walking in
          the footsteps of Him who went about doing good. With hearts ﬁlled with sympathy and compassion, they are to
          minister to those in need of help, bringing to sinners a knowledge of the Saviour’s love. Such work calls for
          laborious effort, but it brings a rich reward. Those who engage in it with sincerity of purpose will see souls
          won to the Saviour....</p>
      <p>“The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.” Revelation 22:17. The charge to give
          this invitation includes the entire church. Everyone who has heard the invitation is to echo the message from
          hill and valley, saying, “Come.”...</p>
      <p>Hundreds, yea, thousands, who have heard the message of salvation, are still idlers in the market place, when
          they might be engaged in some line of active service. To these Christ is saying, “Why stand ye here all the
          day idle?” and He adds, “Go ye also into the vineyard.” Matthew 20:6, 7. Why is it that many more do not
          respond to the call? Is it because they think themselves excused in that they do not stand in the pulpit? Let
          them understand that there is a large work to be done outside the pulpit by thousands of consecrated lay
          members.</p>
      <p>Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession of the whole church so that everyone shall be
          working for Him according to his ability. When the members of the church of God do their appointed work in the
          needy ﬁelds at home and abroad, in fulﬁllment of the gospel commission, the whole world will soon be warned,
          and the Lord Jesus will return to this earth with power and great glory. “This gospel of the kingdom shall be
          preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” Matthew 24:14.</p>
