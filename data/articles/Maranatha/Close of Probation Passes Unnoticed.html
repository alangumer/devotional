    <h1>Chap. 256—Close of Probation Passes Unnoticed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know
          perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 1 Thessalonians 5:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The righteous and the wicked will still be living upon the earth in their mortal <nobr>state—men</nobr> will be
          planting and building, eating and drinking, all unconscious that the ﬁnal, irrevocable decision has been
          pronounced in the sanctuary above. Before the ﬂood, after Noah entered the ark, God shut him in, and shut the
          ungodly out; but for seven days the people, knowing not that their doom was ﬁxed, continued their careless,
          <nobr>pleasure-loving</nobr> life, and mocked the warnings of impending judgment. “So,” says the Saviour,
          “shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” Silently, unnoticed as the midnight thief, will come the
          decisive hour which marks the ﬁxing of every man’s destiny, the ﬁnal withdrawal of mercy’s offer to guilty
          men.</p>
      <p>The people are fast being lulled to a fatal security, to be awakened only by the outpouring of the wrath of
          God.</p>
      <p>The Lord in judgment will at the close of time walk through the earth, the fearful plagues will begin to fall.
          Then those who have despised God’s word, those who have lightly esteemed it, shall wander from sea to sea, and
          from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not ﬁnd
          it....</p>
      <p>The ministers of God will have done their last work, offered their last prayers, shed their last bitter tear
          for a rebellious church and an ungodly people.</p>
      <p>The eye of Jesus, looking down the ages, was ﬁxed upon our time when He said, “If thou hadst known, even thou,
          at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!” It is still thy day, O church of God, whom
          He has made the depositary of His law. This day of trust and probation is drawing to a close. The sun is fast
          westering. Can it be that it will set and thou wilt not know “the things which belong unto thy peace!”? Must
          the irrevocable sentence be passed, “But now they are hid from thine eyes” (Luke 19:42)?</p>
