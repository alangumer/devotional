    <h1>Chap. 204—The Sealing and the Latter Rain</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.
          And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. 2 Timothy 2:19.</strong></p>
      <p>Before the work is closed up and the sealing of God’s people is ﬁnished, we shall receive the outpouring of the
          Spirit of God. Angels from heaven will be in our midst.</p>
      <p>Our heavenly Father claims not at our hands that which we cannot perform. He desires His people to labor
          earnestly to carry out His purpose for them. They are to pray for power, expect power, and receive power, that
          they may grow up into the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Not all members of the church are cultivating personal piety; therefore they do not understand their personal
          responsibility. They do not realize that it is their privilege and duty to reach the high standard of
          Christian perfection.... Are we</p>
      <p>looking forward to the latter rain, conﬁdently hoping for a better day, when the church shall be endued with
          power from on high and thus ﬁtted for work? The latter rain will never refresh and invigorate the indolent,
          who do not use the powers God has given them.</p>
      <p>We are in great need of the pure, <nobr>life-giving</nobr> atmosphere that nurtures and invigorates the
          spiritual life. We need greater earnestness. The solemn message given us to give to the world is to be
          proclaimed with greater fervency, even with an intensity that will impress unbelievers, leading them to see
          that the Most High is working with us, that He is the source of our efﬁciency and strength....</p>
      <p>Are you using all your powers in an effort to bring the lost sheep back to the fold? There are thousands upon
          thousands in ignorance who might be warned. Pray as you have never prayed before for the power of Christ. Pray
          for the inspiration of His Spirit, that you may be ﬁlled with a desire to save those who are perishing. Let
          the prayer ascend to heaven, “God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; that
          thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations” (Psalm 67:1, 2).</p>
