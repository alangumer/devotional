    <h1>iving Fruit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which
          bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the
          healing of the nations. Revelation 22:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The fruit of the tree of life in the Garden of Eden possessed supernatural virtue. To eat of it was to live
          forever. Its fruit was the antidote of death....</p>
      <p>After the entrance of sin the heavenly Husbandman transplanted the tree of life to the Paradise above.</p>
      <p>The redeemed saints, who have loved God and kept His commandments here, will enter in through the gates of the
          city, and have right to the tree of life. They will eat freely of it as our ﬁrst parents did before their
          fall. The leaves of that immortal widespread tree will be for the healing of the nations. All their woes will
          then be gone. Sickness, sorrow, and death they will never again feel, for the leaves of the tree of life have
          healed them. Jesus will then see of the travail of His soul and be satisﬁed, when the redeemed, who have been
          subject to sorrow, toil, and afﬂictions, who have groaned beneath the curse, are gathered up around that tree
          of life to eat of its immortal fruit, that our ﬁrst parents forfeited all right to, by breaking God’s
          commands. There will be no danger of their ever losing right to the tree of life again, for he that tempted
          our ﬁrst parents to sin will be destroyed by the second death.</p>
      <p>Obedience to all the commandments of God was the condition of eating of the tree of life. Adam fell by
          disobedience....</p>
      <p>Obedience through Jesus Christ gives to man perfection of character and a right to that tree of life. The
          conditions of again partaking of the fruit of the tree are plainly stated in the testimony of Jesus Christ to
          John: “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter
          in through the gates into the city.”</p>
      <p>Restored to the tree of life in the <nobr>long-lost</nobr> Eden, the redeemed will “grow up” to the full
          stature of the race in its primeval glory. The last lingering traces of the curse of sin will be removed, and
          Christ’s faithful ones will appear in “the beauty of the Lord our God,” in mind and soul and body reﬂecting
          the perfect image of their Lord. Oh, wonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with
          eager anticipation, but never fully understood.</p>
