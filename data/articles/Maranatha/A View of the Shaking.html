    <h1>Chap. 193—A View of the Shaking</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For in my jealousy and in the ﬁre of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great
          shaking in the land of Israel. Ezekiel 38:19.</strong></p>
      <p>I saw some, with strong faith and agonizing cries, pleading with God. Their countenances were pale and marked
          with deep anxiety, expressive of their internal struggle. Firmness and great earnestness was expressed in
          their countenances; large drops of perspiration fell from their foreheads....</p>
      <p>Evil angels crowded around, pressing darkness upon them to shut out Jesus from their view, that their eyes
          might be drawn to the darkness that surrounded them, and thus they be led to distrust God and murmur against
          Him. Their only safety was in keeping their eyes directed upward. Angels of God had charge over His people,
          and as the poisonous atmosphere of evil angels was pressed around these anxious ones, the heavenly angels were
          continually wafting their wings over them to scatter the thick darkness.</p>
      <p>As the praying ones continued their earnest cries, at times a ray of light from Jesus came to them, to
          encourage their hearts and light up their countenances. Some, I saw, did not participate in this work of
          agonizing and pleading. They seemed indifferent and careless.... The angels of God... went to the aid of the
          earnest,</p>
      <p>praying ones.... But His angels left those who made no effort to help themselves,</p>
      <p>and I lost sight of them.</p>
      <p>I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen and was shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony
          called forth by the counsel of the True Witness of the Laodiceans....</p>
      <p>My attention was then turned to the company I had seen, who were mightily shaken.... The company of guardian
          angels around them had been doubled, and</p>
      <p>they were clothed with an armor from their head to their feet....</p>
      <p>I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth with great power. It had effect....I asked what had
          made this great change. An angel answered, “It is the</p>
      <p>latter rain, the refreshing from the presence of the Lord, the loud cry of the third angel.”</p>
