    <h1>Chap. 301—Crowns Being Prepared for the Faithful</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have fought a good ﬁght, I have ﬁnished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up
          for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me
          only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 2 Timothy 4:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>When the Lord makes up His jewels, the true, the frank, the honest, will be looked upon with pleasure. Angels
          are employed in making crowns for such ones, and upon these <nobr>star-gemmed</nobr> crowns will be reﬂected,
          with splendor, the light which radiates from the throne of God.</p>
      <p>Talk of heavenly things. Talk of Jesus, His loveliness and glory, and of His undying love for you, and let your
          heart ﬂow out in love and gratitude to Him, who died to save you. O, get ready to meet your Lord in peace.
          Those who are ready will soon receive an unfading crown of life, and will dwell forever in the kingdom of God,
          with Christ, with angels, and with those who have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.</p>
      <p>A crown of glory ... is laid up for us who wait, and love, and long for, the appearing of the Saviour.</p>
      <p>It is the waiting ones who are to be crowned with glory, honor, and immortality. You need not talk ... of the
          honors of the world, or the praise of its great ones. They are all vanity. Let but the ﬁnger of God touch
          them, and they would soon go back to dust again. I want honor that is lasting, honor that is immortal, honor
          that will never perish; a crown that is richer than any crown that ever decked the brow of a monarch.</p>
      <p>In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and His Son. The angels of heaven,
          touching their golden harps, will welcome the King, and those who are the trophies of His
          <nobr>victory—those</nobr> who have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph
          will peal forth, ﬁlling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts accompanied by His
          redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of suffering and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> has not been in
          vain.</p>
