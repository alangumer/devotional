      <p><strong>I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is
          the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Corinthians 6:2.</strong></p>
      <p>We believe without a doubt that Christ is soon coming. This is not a fable to us; it is a reality. We have no
          doubt, neither have we had a doubt for years, that the doctrines we hold today are present truth, and that we
          are nearing the judgment. We are preparing to meet Him who, escorted by a retinue of holy angels, is to appear
          in the clouds of heaven to give the faithful and the just the ﬁnishing touch of immortality. When He comes He
          is not to cleanse us of our sins, to remove from us the defects in our characters, or to cure us of the
          inﬁrmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought for us at all, this work will all be accomplished
          before that time. When the Lord comes, those who are holy will be holy still. Those who have preserved their
          bodies and spirits in holiness, in sanctiﬁcation and honor, will then receive the ﬁnishing touch of
          immortality. But those who are unjust, unsanctiﬁed, and ﬁlthy will remain so forever. No work will then be
          done for them to remove their defects and give them holy characters. The Reﬁner does not then sit to pursue
          His reﬁning process and remove their sins and their corruption. This is all to be done in these hours of
          probation. It is now that this work is to be accomplished for us.</p>
      <p>We embrace the truth of God with our different faculties, and as we come under the inﬂuence of that truth, it
          will accomplish the work for us which is necessary to give us a moral ﬁtness for the kingdom of glory and for
          the society of the heavenly angels. We are now in God’s workshop. Many of us are rough stones from the quarry.
          But as we lay hold upon the truth of God, its inﬂuence affects us. It elevates us and removes from us every
          imperfection and sin, of whatever nature. Thus we are prepared to see the King in His beauty and ﬁnally to
          unite with the pure and heavenly angels in the kingdom of glory. It is here that this work is to be
          accomplished for us, here that our bodies and spirits are to be ﬁtted for immortality.</p>
