    <h1>Chap. 122—Satan Redoubles His Efforts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. Psalm
          34:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The power and malice of Satan and his host might justly alarm us were it not that we may ﬁnd shelter and
          deliverance in the superior power of our Redeemer. We carefully secure our houses with bolts and locks to
          protect our property and our lives from evil men; but we seldom think of the evil angels who are constantly
          seeking access to us, and against whose attacks we have, in our own strength, no method of defense. If
          permitted, they can distract our minds, disorder and torment our bodies, destroy our possessions and our
          lives. Their only delight is in misery and destruction. Fearful is the condition of those who resist the
          divine claims and yield to Satan’s temptations, until God gives them up to the control of evil spirits. But
          those who follow Christ are ever safe under His watchcare. Angels that excel in strength are sent from heaven
          to protect them. The wicked one cannot break through the guard which God has stationed about His people.</p>
      <p>The great controversy between Christ and Satan, that has been carried forward for nearly six thousand years, is
          soon to close; and the wicked one redoubles his efforts to defeat the work of Christ in man’s behalf and to
          fasten souls in his snares. To hold the people in darkness and impenitence till the Saviour’s mediation is
          ended, and there is no longer a sacriﬁce for sin, is the object which he seeks to accomplish.</p>
      <p>When there is no special effort made to resist his power, when indifference prevails in the church and the
          world, Satan is not concerned; for he is in no danger of losing those whom he is leading captive at his will.
          But when the attention is called to eternal things, and souls are inquiring, “What must I do to be saved?” he
          is on the ground, seeking to match his power against the power of Christ.... He is in</p>
      <p>attendance when men assemble for the worship of God. Though hidden from sight, he is working with all diligence
          to control the minds of the worshipers.</p>
