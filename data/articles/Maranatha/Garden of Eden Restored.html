    <h1>Chap. 346—Garden of Eden Restored</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
          God. Revelation 2:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The Garden of Eden remained upon the earth long after man had become an outcast from its pleasant paths. The
          fallen race were long permitted to gaze upon the home of innocence, their entrance barred only by the watching
          angels. At the <nobr>cherubim-guarded</nobr> gate of Paradise the divine glory was revealed. Hither came Adam
          and his sons to worship God. Here they renewed their vows of obedience to that law the transgression of which
          had banished them from Eden. When the tide of iniquity overspread the world, and the wickedness of men
          determined their destruction by a ﬂood of waters, the hand that had planted Eden withdrew it from the earth.
          But in the ﬁnal restitution, when there shall be “a new heaven and a new earth” (Revelation 21:1), it is to be
          restored more gloriously adorned than at the beginning.</p>
      <p>Then they that have kept God’s commandments shall breathe in immortal vigor beneath the tree of life; and
          through unending ages the inhabitants of sinless worlds shall behold, in that garden of delight, a sample of
          the perfect work of God’s creation, untouched by the curse of <nobr>sin—a</nobr> sample of what the whole
          earth would have become, had man but fulﬁlled the Creator’s glorious plan.</p>
      <p>Adam is reinstated in his ﬁrst dominion. Transported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once his
          <nobr>delight—the</nobr> very trees whose fruit he himself had gathered in the days of his innocence and joy.
          He sees the vines that his own hands have trained, the very ﬂowers that he once loved to care for. His mind
          grasps the reality of the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed Eden restored.</p>
      <p>Restored to the tree of life in the <nobr>long-lost</nobr> Eden, the redeemed will “grow up” (Malachi 4:2) to
          the full stature of the race in its primeval glory. The last lingering traces of the curse of sin will be
          removed, and Christ’s faithful ones will appear in “the beauty of the Lord our God,” in mind and soul and body
          reﬂecting the perfect image of their Lord. Oh, wonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for,
          contemplated with eager anticipation, but never fully understood.</p>
