    <h1>Chap. 277—The Earth Flees from its Maker Therefore</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of
          hosts, and in the day of his ﬁerce anger. And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh
          up. Isaiah 13:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>Thick clouds still cover the sky; yet the sun now and then breaks through, appearing like the avenging eye of
          Jehovah. Fierce lightnings leap from the heavens, enveloping the earth in a sheet of ﬂame. Above the terriﬁc
          roar of thunder, voices, mysterious and awful, declare the doom of the wicked. The words spoken are not
          comprehended by all; but they are distinctly understood by the false teachers. Those who a little before were
          so reckless, so boastful and deﬁant, so exultant in their cruelty to God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr>
          people, are now overwhelmed with consternation and shuddering in fear. Their wails are heard above the sound
          of the elements. Demons acknowledge the deity of Christ and tremble before His power, while men are
          supplicating for mercy and groveling in abject terror....</p>
      <p>Through a rift in the clouds there beams a star whose brilliancy is increased fourfold in contrast with the
          darkness. It speaks hope and joy to the faithful, but severity and wrath to the transgressors of God’s law.
          Those who have sacriﬁced all for Christ are now secure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord’s pavilion. They
          have been tested, and before the world and the despisers of truth they have evinced their ﬁdelity to Him who
          died for them. A marvelous change has come over those who have held fast their integrity in the very face of
          death. They have been suddenly delivered from the dark and terrible tyranny of men transformed to demons.
          Their faces, so lately pale, anxious, and haggard, are now aglow with wonder, faith, and love. Their voices
          rise in triumphant song: “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not
          we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though
          the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.” Psalm
          <nobr>46:1-3.</nobr></p>
