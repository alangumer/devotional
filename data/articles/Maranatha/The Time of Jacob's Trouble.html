    <h1>Chap. 264—The Time of Jacob’s Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he
          shall be saved out of it. Jeremiah 30:7.</strong></p>
      <p>I saw that the four angels would hold the four winds until Jesus’ work was done in the sanctuary, and then will
          come the seven last plagues. These plagues enraged the wicked against the righteous; they thought that we had
          brought the judgments of God upon them, and that if they could rid the earth of us, the plagues would then be
          stayed. A decree went forth to slay the saints, which caused them to cry day and night for deliverance. This
          was the time of Jacob’s trouble.</p>
      <p>As Satan inﬂuenced Esau to march against Jacob, so he will stir up the wicked to destroy God’s people in the
          time of trouble. And as he accused Jacob, he will urge his accusations against the people of God. He numbers
          the world as his subjects; but the little company who keep the commandments of God are resisting his
          supremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete. He sees that holy angels are
          guarding them, and he infers that their sins have been pardoned; but he does not know that their cases have
          been decided in the sanctuary above. He has an accurate knowledge of the sins which he has tempted them to
          commit, and he presents these before God in the most exaggerated light, representing this people to be just as
          deserving as himself of exclusion from the favor of God. He declares that the Lord cannot in justice forgive
          their sins and yet destroy him and his angels. He claims them as his prey and demands that they be given into
          his hands to destroy.</p>
      <p>As Satan accuses the people of God on account of their sins, the Lord permits him to try them to the uttermost.
          Their conﬁdence in God, their faith and ﬁrmness, will be severely tested. As they review the past, their hopes
          sink; for in their whole lives they can see little good. They are fully conscious of their weakness and
          unworthiness. Satan endeavors to terrify them with the thought that their cases are hopeless, that the stain
          of their deﬁlement will never be washed away. He hopes so to destroy their faith that they will yield to his
          temptations and turn from their allegiance to God.</p>
