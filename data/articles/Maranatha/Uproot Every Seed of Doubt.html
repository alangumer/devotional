    <h1>Chap. 44—Uproot Every Seed of Doubt</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Cast not away therefore your conﬁdence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of
          patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.... We are not of them who
          draw back unto perdition;</strong></p>
      <p>but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. Hebrews <nobr>10:35-39.</nobr></p>
      <p>I saw that we are now in the shaking time. Satan is working with all his power to wrest souls from the hand of
          Christ and cause them to trample underfoot the Son of God....</p>
      <p>Character is being developed. Angels of God are weighing moral worth. God is testing and proving His people.
          These words were presented to me by the angel: “Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
          of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
          any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the
          beginning of our conﬁdence stedfast unto the end.”</p>
      <p>God is displeased that any of His people who have known the power of His grace should talk their doubts, and by
          thus doing make themselves a channel for Satan to transmit his suggestions to other minds. A seed of unbelief
          and evil sown is not readily rooted up. Satan nourishes it every hour, and it ﬂourishes and becomes strong. A
          good seed sown needs to be nourished, watered, and tenderly cared for; because every poisonous inﬂuence is
          thrown about it to hinder its growth and cause it to die. Satan’s efforts are more powerful now than ever
          before, for he knows that his time to deceive is short....</p>
      <p>God’s people will be sifted, even as corn is sifted in a sieve, until all the chaff is separated from the pure
          kernels of grain. We are to look to Christ for an example and imitate the humble pattern....</p>
      <p>I was shown the saints’ reward, the immortal inheritance. Then I was shown how much God’s people had endured
          for the truth’s sake, and that they would count heaven cheap enough. They reckoned that the sufferings of this
          present time were not worthy to be compared with the glory which should be revealed in them. The people of God
          in these last days will be tried. But soon their last trial will come, and then they will receive the gift of
          eternal life.</p>
