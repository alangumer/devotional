    <h1>Chap. 25—The Counterfeit Revival</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own
          selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, ... having a form
          of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 2 Timothy 3:1, 2, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>Before the ﬁnal visitation of God’s judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord such a
          revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit and power of God
          will be poured out upon His children. At that time many will separate themselves from those churches in which
          the love of this world has supplanted love for God and His word. Many, both of ministers and people, will
          gladly accept those great truths which God has caused to be proclaimed at this time to prepare a people for
          the Lord’s second coming. The enemy of souls desires to hinder this work; and before the time for such a
          movement shall come, he will endeavor to prevent it by introducing a counterfeit. In those churches which he
          can bring under his deceptive power he will make it appear that God’s special blessing is poured out; there
          will be manifest what is thought to be great religious interest. Multitudes will exult that God is working
          marvelously for them, when the work is that of another spirit. Under a religious guise, Satan will seek to
          extend his inﬂuence over the Christian world.</p>
      <p>In many of the revivals which have occurred during the last half century, the same inﬂuences have been at work,
          to a greater or less degree, that will be manifest in the more extensive movements of the future. There is an
          emotional excitement, a mingling of the true with the false, that is well adapted to mislead. Yet none need be
          deceived. In the light of God’s word it is not difﬁcult to determine the nature of these movements. Wherever
          men neglect the testimony of the Bible, turning away from those plain, <nobr>soul-testing</nobr> truths which
          require <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and renunciation of the world, there we may be sure that God’s blessing is
          not bestowed. And by the rule which Christ Himself has given, “Ye shall know them by their fruits” (Matthew
          7:16), it is evident that these movements are not the work of the Spirit of God.</p>
