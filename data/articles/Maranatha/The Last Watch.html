    <h1>Chap. 48—The Last Watch</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at
          the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he ﬁnd you sleeping. Mark 13:35, 36.</strong></p>
      <p>A company was presented before me.... Their eyes were directed heavenward,</p>
      <p>and the words of their Master were upon their lips: “What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.” ... The Lord
          intimates a delay before the morning ﬁnally dawns. But He would not have them give way to weariness, nor relax
          their earnest watchfulness, because the morning does not open upon them as soon as they expected....</p>
      <p>I saw that it was impossible to have the affections and interests engrossed in worldly cares, to be increasing
          earthly possessions, and yet be in a waiting, watching position, as our Saviour has commanded. Said the angel:
          “They can secure but one world. In order to acquire the heavenly treasure, they must sacriﬁce the earthly.
          They cannot have both worlds.” ...</p>
      <p>I saw that watch after watch was in the past. Because of this, should there be a lack of vigilance? Oh, no!
          There is the greater necessity of unceasing watchfulness, for now the moments are fewer than before the
          passing of the ﬁrst watch.... If we</p>
      <p>watched with unabated vigilance then, how much more need of double watchfulness in the second watch. The
          passing of the second watch has brought us to the third, and now it is inexcusable to abate our watchfulness.
          The third watch calls for threefold earnestness. To become impatient now would be to lose all our earnest,
          persevering watching heretofore. The long night of gloom is trying; but the morning is deferred in mercy,
          because if the Master should come, so many would be found unready. God’s unwillingness to have His people
          perish has been the reason for so long delay....</p>
      <p>The difference between those who love the world and those who love Christ is so plain as to be unmistakable.
          While worldlings are all earnestness and ambition to secure earthly treasure, God’s people are not conformed
          to the world, but show by their earnest, watching, waiting position that they are transformed; that their home
          is not in this world, but that they are seeking a better country, even a heavenly.</p>
