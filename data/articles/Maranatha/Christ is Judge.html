    <h1>Chap. 333—Christ is Judge</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son. John 5:22.</strong></p>
      <p>In His teachings, Christ sought to impress men with the certainty of the coming judgment, and with its
          publicity. This is not the judgment of a few individuals, or even of a nation, but of a whole world of human
          intelligences, of accountable beings. It is to be held in the presence of other worlds, that the love, the
          integrity, the service, of man for God, may be honored to the highest degree. There will be no lack of glory
          and honor.... The law of God will be revealed in its majesty; and</p>
      <p>those who have stood in deﬁant rebellion against its holy precepts will understand that the law that they have
          discarded, and despised, and trampled underfoot is God’s standard of character....</p>
      <p>In this speck of a world, the heavenly universe manifests the greatest interest; for Jesus paid an inﬁnite
          price for the souls of its inhabitants....</p>
      <p>God has committed all judgment unto the Son, for without controversy He is God manifest in the ﬂesh.</p>
      <p>God designed that the Prince of sufferers in humanity should be judge of the whole world. He who came from the
          heavenly courts to save man from eternal death; ... He who submitted to be arraigned before an earthly
          tribunal, and who suffered the ignominious death of the <nobr>cross—He</nobr> alone is to pronounce the
          sentence of reward or of punishment. He who submitted to the suffering and humiliation of the cross here, in
          the counsel of God is to have the fullest compensation, and ascend the throne acknowledged by all the heavenly
          universe as the King of saints. He has undertaken the work of salvation, and shown before unfallen worlds and
          the heavenly family that the work He has begun He is able to complete....</p>
      <p>In the day of ﬁnal punishment and reward, both saints and sinners will recognize in Him who was cruciﬁed the
          Judge of all living.... Solemn will be the day of ﬁnal</p>
      <p>decision.... Probationary time is granted us, opportunities and privileges are given</p>
      <p>us, to make our calling and election sure. How we should prize this precious time, and improve every talent God
          has given, that we may be faithful stewards over ourselves.</p>
