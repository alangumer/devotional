    <h1>Chap. 209—The World Against God’s People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the
          commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Revelation 12:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Our people have been regarded as too insigniﬁcant to be worthy of notice, but a change will come. The Christian
          world is now making movements which will necessarily bring <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people into
          prominence.</p>
      <p>The whole world is to be stirred with enmity against <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists, because they will not
          yield homage to the papacy, by honoring Sunday, the institution of this antichristian power. It is the purpose
          of Satan to cause them to be blotted from the earth, in order that his supremacy of the world may not be
          disputed.</p>
      <p>Every position of truth taken by our people will bear the criticism of the greatest minds; the highest of the
          world’s great men will be brought in contact with truth, and therefore every position we take should be
          critically examined and tested by the Scriptures. Now we seem to be unnoticed, but this will not always be.
          Movements are at work to bring us to the front, and if our theories of truth can be picked to pieces by
          historians or the world’s greatest men, it will be done.</p>
      <p>We must individually know for ourselves what is truth, and be prepared to give a reason of the hope that we
          have with meekness and fear, not in a proud, boasting, <nobr>self-sufﬁciency,</nobr> but with the spirit of
          Christ. We are nearing the time when we shall stand individually alone to answer for our belief.</p>
      <p>We shall be attacked on every point; we shall be tried to the utmost. We do not want to hold our faith simply
          because it was handed down to us by our fathers. Such a faith will not stand the terrible test that is before
          us. We want to know why we are <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists, what real reason we have for coming out
          from the world as a separate and distinct people....</p>
      <p>The powers of darkness will open their batteries upon us; and all who are indifferent and careless, who have
          set their affections on their earthly treasure, and who have not cared to understand God’s dealings with His
          people, will be ready victims. No power but a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, will ever make us
          steadfast; but with this, one may chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to ﬂight.</p>
