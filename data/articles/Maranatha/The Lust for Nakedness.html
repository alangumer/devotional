    <h1>Chap. 135—The Lust for Nakedness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
          Matthew 5:28.</strong></p>
      <p>Many of the young are eager for books. They read everything they can obtain. Exciting love stories and impure
          pictures have a corrupting inﬂuence. Novels are eagerly perused by many, and, as the result, their imagination
          becomes deﬁled. In the cars, photographs of females in a state of nudity are frequently circulated for sale.
          These disgusting pictures are ... hung upon the walls of those who deal in engravings. This is an age when
          corruption is teeming everywhere. The lust of the eye and corrupt passions are aroused by beholding and by
          reading. The heart is corrupted through the imagination. The mind takes pleasure in contemplating scenes which
          awaken the lower and baser passions. These vile images, seen through deﬁled imagination, corrupt the morals
          and prepare the deluded, infatuated beings to give loose rein to lustful passions. Then follow sins and crimes
          which drag beings formed in the image of God down to a level with the beasts, sinking them at last in
          perdition. Avoid reading and seeing things which will suggest impure thoughts. Cultivate the moral and
          intellectual powers. Let not these noble powers become enfeebled and perverted by much reading of even
          storybooks....</p>
      <p>It is impossible for the youth to possess a healthy tone of mind and correct religious principles unless they
          enjoy the perusal of the word of God. This book contains the most interesting history, points out the way of
          salvation through Christ, and is their guide to a higher and better life. They would all pronounce it the most
          interesting book they ever perused, if their imagination had not become perverted by exciting stories of a
          ﬁctitious character. You who are looking for your Lord to come the second time to change your mortal bodies,
          and to fashion them like unto His most glorious body, must come up upon a higher plane of action. You must
          work from a higher standpoint than you have hitherto done, or you will not be of that number who will receive
          the ﬁnishing touch of immortality.</p>
