    <h1>Chap. 234—Time of Sealing Soon Over</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
          John 9:4.</strong></p>
      <p>The sealing time is very short, and will soon be over. Now is the time, while the four angels are holding the
          four winds, to make our calling and election sure.</p>
      <p>I was pointed down to the time when the third angel’s message was closing. The power of God had rested upon His
          people; they had accomplished their work and were prepared for the trying hour before them.</p>
      <p>They had received the latter rain, or refreshing from the presence of the Lord, and the living testimony had
          been revived. The last great warning had sounded everywhere, and it had stirred up and enraged the inhabitants
          of the earth who would not receive the message.</p>
      <p>I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven. An angel with a writer’s inkhorn by his side returned from the
          earth and reported to Jesus that his work was done, and the saints were numbered and sealed. Then I saw Jesus
          ... throw down the censer. He raised His hands, and with a loud voice said, “It is done.”</p>
      <p>I also saw that many do not realize what they must be in order to live in the sight of the Lord without a high
          priest in the sanctuary through the time of trouble. Those who receive the seal of the living God and are
          protected in the time of trouble must reﬂect the image of Jesus fully.</p>
      <p>I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful and were looking to the time of “refreshing” and the
          “latter rain” to ﬁt them to stand in the day of the Lord and to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the
          time of trouble without a shelter!</p>
      <p>When Jesus leaves the sanctuary, then they who are holy and righteous will be holy and righteous still; for all
          their sins will then be blotted out, and they will be sealed with the seal of the living God. But those that
          are unjust and ﬁlthy will be unjust and ﬁlthy still; for then there will be no Priest in the sanctuary to
          offer their sacriﬁces, their confessions, and their prayers before the Father’s throne. Therefore what is done
          to rescue souls from the coming storm of wrath must be done before Jesus leaves the most holy place of the
          heavenly sanctuary.</p>
