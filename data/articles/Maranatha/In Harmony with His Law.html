    <h1>Chap. 223—In Harmony with His Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. Psalm
          119:34.</strong></p>
      <p>In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When
          this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness,
          from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty....</p>
      <p>Erroneous theories of sanctiﬁcation, ... springing from neglect or rejection of the divine law, have a
          prominent place in the religious movements of the day. These theories are both false in doctrine and dangerous
          in practical results; and the fact that they are so generally ﬁnding favor, renders it doubly essential that
          all have a clear understanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.</p>
      <p>True sanctiﬁcation is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Thessalonian church, declares:
          “This is the will of God, even your sanctiﬁcation.” And he prays: “The very God of peace sanctify you wholly”
          (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23). The Bible clearly teaches what sanctiﬁcation is and how it is to be attained. The
          Saviour prayed for His disciples: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth” (John 17:17, 19). And
          Paul teaches that believers are to be “sanctiﬁed by the Holy Ghost” (Romans 15:16). What is the work of the
          Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: “When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
          truth” (John 16:13). And the psalmist says: “Thy law is the truth.” By the Word and the Spirit of God are
          opened to men the great principles of righteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is “holy,
          and just, and good,” a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a character formed by obedience to
          that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He says: “I have kept my Father’s
          commandments.” “I do always those things that please him” (John 15:10; 8:29). The followers of Christ are to
          become like <nobr>Him—by</nobr> the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy
          law. This is Bible sanctiﬁcation.</p>
      <p>This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God.</p>
