    <h1>Chap. 26—Presumptuous, Careless Delay</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked,
          and they see his shame. Revelation 16:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The evil servant says in his heart, “My lord delayeth his coming.” He does not say that Christ will not come.
          He does not scoff at the idea of His second coming. But in his heart and by his actions and words he declares
          that the Lord’s coming is delayed. He banishes from the mind of others the conviction that the Lord is coming
          quickly. His inﬂuence leads men to presumptuous, careless delay.... He</p>
      <p>mingles with the world....It is a fearful assimilation. With the world he is taken in</p>
      <p>the snare....</p>
      <p>“If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will
          come upon thee.” Revelation 3:3. The advent of Christ will surprise the false teachers. They are saying,
          “Peace and safety.” Like the priests and teachers before the fall of Jerusalem, they look for the church to
          enjoy earthly prosperity and glory. The signs of the times they interpret as foreshadowing this. But what
          saith the word of Inspiration? “Sudden destruction cometh upon them.” 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Upon all who dwell
          on the face of the whole earth, upon all who make this world their home, the day of God will come as a
          snare....</p>
      <p>The world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep, asleep in carnal security. Men are putting
          afar off the coming of the Lord. They laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, “All things continue as they
          were from the beginning.” “Tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.” 2 Peter 3:4; Isaiah 56:12.
          We will go deeper into pleasure loving. But Christ says, “Behold, I come as a thief.” Revelation 16:15. At the
          very time when the world is asking in scorn, “Where is the promise of his coming?” the signs are fulﬁlling.
          While they cry, “Peace and safety,” sudden destruction is coming. When the scorner, the rejecter of truth, has
          become presumptuous; when the routine of work in the various <nobr>money-making</nobr> lines is carried on
          without regard to principle; when the student is eagerly seeking knowledge of everything but his Bible, Christ
          comes as a thief.</p>
