    <h1>Chap. 236—A Sign that Distinguishes God’s People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am
          the Lord that sanctify them. Ezekiel 20:12.</strong></p>
      <p>As the Sabbath was the sign that distinguished Israel when they came out of Egypt to enter the earthly Canaan,
          so it is the sign that now distinguishes God’s people as they come out from the world to enter the heavenly
          rest.</p>
      <p>The observance of the Sabbath is the means ordained by God of preserving a knowledge of Himself and of
          distinguishing between His loyal subjects and the transgressors of His law.</p>
      <p>It [the Sabbath] belongs to Christ.... Since He made all things, He made the</p>
      <p>Sabbath. By Him it was set apart as a memorial of the work of creation. It points to Him as both the Creator
          and the Sanctiﬁer. It declares that He who created all things in heaven and in earth, and by whom all things
          hold together, is the head of the church, and that by His power we are reconciled to God. For, speaking of
          Israel, He said, “I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am
          the Lord that sanctify <nobr>them”—make</nobr> them holy. Then the Sabbath is a sign of Christ’s power to make
          us holy. And it is given to all whom Christ makes holy. As a sign of His sanctifying power, the Sabbath is
          given to all who through Christ become a part of the Israel of God....</p>
      <p>To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ’s creative and redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing
          Christ in it, they delight themselves in Him. The Sabbath points them to the works of creation as an evidence
          of His mighty power in redemption. While it calls to mind the lost peace of Eden, it tells of peace restored
          through the Saviour. And every object in nature repeats His invitation, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and
          are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28.</p>
      <p>The Sabbath is a golden clasp that unites God and His people.</p>
