      <p><strong>I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake. Revelation
          6:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Prophecy not only foretells the manner and object of Christ’s coming, but presents tokens by which men are to
          know when it is near.... The revelator thus</p>
      <p>describes the ﬁrst of the signs to precede the second advent: “There was a great earthquake; and the sun became
          black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.”</p>
      <p>These signs were witnessed before the opening of the nineteenth century. In fulﬁlment of this prophecy there
          occurred, in the year 1755, the most terrible earthquake that has ever been recorded. Though commonly known as
          the earthquake of Lisbon, it extended to the greater part of Europe, Africa, and America. It was felt in
          Greenland, in the West Indies, in the island of Madeira, in Norway and Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland. It
          pervaded an extent of not less than four million square miles. In Africa the shock was almost as severe as in
          Europe. A great part of Algiers was destroyed; and a short distance from Morocco, a village containing eight
          or ten thousand inhabitants was swallowed up. A vast wave swept over the coast of Spain and Africa, engulﬁng
          cities, and causing great destruction.</p>
      <p>It was in Spain and Portugal that the shock manifested its extreme violence. At Cadiz the inﬂowing wave was
          said to be sixty feet high. Mountains, “some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were,
          from their very <nobr>foundations.” ...—Sir</nobr> Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology, p. 495.... “The</p>
      <p>earthquake happened on a holy day, when the churches and convents were full of people, very few of whom
          <nobr>escaped.”—Encyclopedia</nobr> Americana, art. “Lisbon,” note (ed. 1831)... It has been estimated that
          ninety thousand persons lost their lives on that fatal day.</p>
      <p>How frequently we hear of earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by ﬁre and ﬂood, with great loss of life
          and property! Apparently these calamities are capricious outbreaks of disorganized, unregulated forces of
          nature, wholly beyond the control of man; but in them all, God’s purpose may be read. They are among the
          agencies by which He seeks to arouse men and women to a sense of their danger.</p>
