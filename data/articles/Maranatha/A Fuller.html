      <p><strong>Knowledge of God This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
          whom thou hast sent. John 17:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Only by knowing God here can we prepare to meet Him at His coming.... But</p>
      <p>many of those who profess to believe in Christ do not know God. They have only a surface religion. They do not
          love God; they do not study His character; therefore they do not know how to trust, how to look and live. They
          do not know what restful love is, or what it means to walk by faith.... They fail of understanding that it is
          their</p>
      <p>duty to receive, in order that they may enrich others.</p>
      <p>The world by wisdom knows not God. Many have talked eloquently about Him, but their reasoning brings men no
          nearer to Him, because they themselves are not in vital connection with Him. Professing themselves to be wise,
          they become fools. Their knowledge of God is imperfect.</p>
      <p>We cannot by searching ﬁnd out God, but He has revealed Himself in His Son, who is the brightness of the
          Father’s glory and the express image of His person. If we desire a knowledge of God we must be Christlike....
          Living a pure life through</p>
      <p>faith in Christ as a personal Saviour will bring to the believer a clearer, higher conception of God.</p>
      <p>Christ is a perfect revelation of God. “No man hath seen God at any time,” He says; “the only begotten Son,
          which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.” Only by knowing Christ can we know God. And as we
          behold Him, we shall be changed into His image, prepared to meet Him at His coming....</p>
      <p>Now is the time to prepare for the coming of our Lord. Readiness to meet Him cannot be attained in a moment’s
          time. Preparatory to that solemn scene there must be vigilant waiting and watching, combined with earnest
          work. So God’s children glorify Him. Amid the busy scenes of life their voices will be heard speaking words of
          encouragement, hope, and faith. All they have and are is consecrated to the Master’s service. Thus they
          prepare to meet their Lord; and when He comes, they will say, with joy, “This is our God; we have waited for
          him, and he will save us....</p>
      <p>We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”</p>
