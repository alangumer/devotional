      <p><strong>He which testiﬁeth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
          Revelation 22:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The [second] coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of His true followers. The Saviour’s parting
          promise upon Olivet, that He would come again, lighted up the future for His disciples, ﬁlling their hearts
          with joy and hope that sorrow could not quench nor trials dim. Amid suffering and persecution, “the appearing
          of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” was the “blessed hope.” When the Thessalonian Christians were
          ﬁlled with grief as they buried their loved ones, who had hoped to live to witness the coming of the Lord,
          Paul, their teacher, pointed them to the resurrection, to take place at the Saviour’s advent. Then the dead in
          Christ should rise, and together with the living be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. “And so,” he said,
          “shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” 1 Thessalonians
          <nobr>4:16-18. ...</nobr></p>
      <p>From the dungeon, the stake, the scaffold, where saints and martyrs witnessed for the truth, comes down the
          centuries the utterance of their faith and hope. Being “assured of His personal resurrection, and consequently
          of their own at His coming, for this cause,” says one of these Christians, “they despised death, and were
          found to be above <nobr>it.”—Daniel</nobr> T. Taylor, The Reign of Christ on Earth: or, The Voice of the
          Church in All Ages, p. 33. They were willing to go down to the grave, that they might “rise free.” They looked
          for the “Lord to come from heaven in the clouds with the glory of His Father,” “bringing to the just the times
          of the kingdom.” The Waldenses cherished the same faith. Wycliffe looked forward to the Redeemer’s appearing
          as the hope of the church.</p>
      <p>On rocky Patmos the beloved disciple hears the promise, “Surely I come quickly,” and his longing response
          voices the prayer of the church in all her pilgrimage, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” Revelation 22:20.</p>
