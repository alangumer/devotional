      <p><strong>Beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
          temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to
          brotherly kindness charity. 2 Peter <nobr>1:5-7.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Point the youth to Peter’s ladder of eight rounds, and place their feet, not on the highest round, but on the
          lowest, and with earnest solicitation urge them to climb to the very top.</p>
      <p>Christ ... is the ladder. The base is planted ﬁrmly on the earth in His humanity; the topmost round reaches to
          the throne of God in His divinity. The humanity of Christ embraces fallen humanity, while His divinity lays
          hold upon the throne of God. We are saved by climbing round after round of the ladder, looking to Christ,
          clinging to Christ, mounting step by step to the height of Christ, so that He is made unto us wisdom and
          righteousness and sanctiﬁcation and redemption. Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness,
          brotherly kindness, and charity are the rounds of this ladder. All these graces are to be manifested in the
          Christian character; and “if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered
          unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p>You are not to think that you must wait until you have perfected one grace before cultivating another. No; they
          are to grow up together...; every day that you live, you can be perfecting the blessed attributes fully
          revealed in the character of Christ....</p>
      <p>Do not become overwhelmed with the great amount of work you must do in your lifetime, for you are not required
          to do it all at once. Let every power of your being go to each day’s work, improve each precious opportunity,
          appreciate the helps that God gives you, and make advancement up the ladder of progress step by step. Remember
          that you are to live but one day at a time, that God has given you one day, and heavenly records will show how
          you have valued its privileges and opportunities. May you so improve every day given you of God, that at last
          you may hear the Master say, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”</p>
