    <h1>Chap. 20—The Faithful Ones will not Fail</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
          Jesus. Revelation 14:12.</strong></p>
      <p>We have need now for more than human wisdom in reading and searching the Scriptures; and if we come to God’s
          Word with humble hearts, He will raise up a standard for us against the lawless element.</p>
      <p>It is difﬁcult to hold fast the beginning of our conﬁdence ﬁrm unto the end; and the difﬁculty increases when
          there are hidden inﬂuences constantly at work to bring in another spirit, a counterworking element, on Satan’s
          side of the question. In the absence of persecution, there have drifted into our ranks some who appear sound,
          and their Christianity unquestionable, but who, if persecution should arise, would go out from us. In the
          crisis, they would see force in specious reasoning that has had an inﬂuence on their minds. Satan has prepared
          various snares to meet varied minds. When the law of God is made void the church will be sifted by ﬁery
          trials, and a larger proportion than we now anticipate, will give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of
          devils. Instead of being strengthened when brought into strait places, many prove that they are not living
          branches of the True Vine....</p>
      <p>But when the world makes void the law of God, what will be the effect upon the truly obedient and righteous?
          Will they be carried away by the strong current of evil? Because so many rank themselves under the banner of
          the prince of darkness, will God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people swerve from their allegiance?
          Never! Not one who is abiding in Christ will fail or fall. His followers will bow in obedience to a higher
          authority than that of any earthly potentate. While the contempt placed upon God’s commandments leads many to
          suppress the truth and show less reverence for it, the faithful ones will with greater earnestness hold aloft
          its distinguishing truths. We are not left to our own direction.... We should consult His Word with
          humble</p>
      <p>hearts, ask His counsel, and give up our will to His. We can do nothing without God.</p>
