    <h1>Chap. 22—Study Daniel and the Revelation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which
          are written therein: for the time is at hand. Revelation 1:3.</strong></p>
      <p>A message that will arouse the churches is to be proclaimed. Every effort is to be made to give the light, not
          only to our people, but to the world. I have been instructed that the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation
          should be printed in small books, with the necessary explanations, and should be sent all over the world. Our
          own people need to have the light placed before them in clearer lines.</p>
      <p>Those who eat the ﬂesh and drink the blood of the Son of God will bring from the books of Daniel and Revelation
          truth that is inspired by the Holy Spirit. They will start into action forces that cannot be repressed. The
          lips of children will be opened to proclaim the mysteries that have been hidden from the minds of men....</p>
      <p>Many of the prophecies are about to be fulﬁlled in quick succession. Every element of power is about to be set
          to work. Past history will be repeated; old controversies will arouse to new life, and peril will beset God’s
          people on every side. Intensity is taking hold of the human family. It is permeating everything upon the
          earth....</p>
      <p>Study Revelation in connection with Daniel, for history will be repeated.... We,</p>
      <p>with all our religious advantages, ought to know far more today than we do know. Angels desire to look into the
          truths that are revealed to the people who with</p>
      <p>contrite hearts are searching the word of God and praying for greater lengths and breadths and depths and
          heights of the knowledge which He alone can give.</p>
      <p>As we near the close of this world’s history, the prophecies relating to the last days especially demand our
          study. The last book of the New Testament Scriptures is full of truth that we need to understand. Satan has
          blinded the minds of many so that they have been glad of any excuse for not making the Revelation their study.
          But Christ through His servant John has here declared what shall be in the last days; and He says, “Blessed is
          he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
          therein.”</p>
