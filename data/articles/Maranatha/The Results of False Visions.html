    <h1>Chap. 150—The Results of False Visions</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the ﬁre. Wherefore by their
          fruits ye shall know them. Matthew 7:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>Several now living [1890] are skeptics, have no belief in the gifts of the church, no faith in the truth, no
          religion at all. Such, I have been shown, is the sure result of spurious visions....</p>
      <p>Satan is ... constantly pressing in the <nobr>spurious—to</nobr> lead away from the truth. The very last
          deception of Satan will be to make of none effect the testimony of</p>
      <p>the Spirit of God. “Where there is no vision, the people perish” (Proverbs 29:18). Satan will work ingeniously,
          in different ways and through different agencies, to unsettle the conﬁdence of God’s remnant people in the
          true testimony. He will bring in spurious visions to mislead, and will mingle the false with the true, and so
          disgust people that they will regard everything that bears the name of visions as a species of fanaticism; but
          honest souls, by contrasting false and true, will be enabled to distinguish between them....</p>
      <p>There is nothing more detrimental to the soul’s interest, its purity, its true and holy conceptions of God, and
          of sacred and eternal things, than constantly giving heed to and exalting that which is not from God. It
          poisons the heart, and degrades the understanding. Pure truth can be traced to its divine Source, by its
          elevating, reﬁning, sanctifying inﬂuence upon the character of the receiver. The Author of all truth prayed to
          His Father, “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
          that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the
          world may believe that thou hast sent me” (John 17:20, 21).</p>
      <p>Things will be constantly arising to cause disunion, to draw away from the truth. This questioning,
          criticizing, denouncing, passing judgment on others, is not an evidence of the grace of Christ in the heart.
          It does not produce unity. Such work has been carried on in the past by persons claiming to have wonderful
          light, when they were deep in sin.</p>
