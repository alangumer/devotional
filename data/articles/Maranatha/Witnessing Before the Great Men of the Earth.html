    <h1>Chap. 245—Witnessing Before the Great Men of the Earth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the
          Gentiles. Matthew 10:18.</strong></p>
      <p>The time is not far off when the people of God will be called upon to give their testimony before the rulers of
          the earth. Not one in twenty has a realization of what rapid strides we are making toward the great crisis in
          our history.... There is no time</p>
      <p>for vanity, for triﬂing, for engaging the mind in unimportant matters.</p>
      <p>Kings, governors, and great men will hear of you through the reports of those who are at enmity with you, and
          your faith and character will be misrepresented before them. But those who are falsely accused will have an
          opportunity to appear in the presence of their accusers to answer for themselves. They will have the privilege
          of bringing the light before those who are called the great men of the earth, and if you have studied the
          Bible, if you are ready to give an answer to every man that asketh you of the hope that is in you with
          meekness and fear, your enemies will not be able to gainsay your wisdom.</p>
      <p>You now have an opportunity to attain to the greatest intellectual power through the study of the Word of God.
          But if you are indolent, and fail to dig deep in the mines of truth, you will not be ready for the crisis that
          is soon to come upon us. O that you would realize that each moment is golden. If you live by every word that
          proceedeth out of the mouth of God, you will not be found unprepared.</p>
      <p>You know not where you may be called upon to give your witness of truth. Many will have to stand in the
          legislative courts; some will have to stand before kings and before the learned of the earth, to answer for
          their faith. Those who have only a superﬁcial understanding of truth will not be able clearly to expound the
          Scriptures, and give deﬁnite reasons for their faith. They will become confused, and will not be workmen that
          need not to be ashamed. Let no one imagine that he has no need to study, because he is not to preach in the
          sacred desk. You know not what God may require of you.</p>
