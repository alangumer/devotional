    <h1>Chap. 27—A Heaven to Win</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch ye therefore, and pray always. Luke 21:36.</strong></p>
      <p>The days in which we live are solemn and important. The Spirit of God is gradually but surely being withdrawn
          from the earth....</p>
      <p>The condition of things in the world shows that troublous times are right upon us. The daily papers are full of
          indications of a terrible conﬂict in the near future. Bold robberies are of frequent occurrence. Strikes are
          common. Thefts and murders are committed on every hand. Men possessed of demons are taking the lives of men,
          women, and little children. Men have become infatuated with vice, and every species of evil prevails.</p>
      <p>Everything in the world is in agitation. The signs of the times are ominous. Coming events cast their shadows
          before. The Spirit of God is withdrawing from the earth, and calamity follows calamity by sea and by land.
          There are tempests, earthquakes, ﬁres, ﬂoods, murders of every grade.... Rapidly are men ranging</p>
      <p>themselves under the banner they have chosen. Restlessly are they waiting and watching the movements of their
          leaders. There are those who are waiting and watching and working for our Lord’s appearing. Another class are
          falling into line under the generalship of the ﬁrst great apostate. Few believe with heart and soul that we
          have a hell to shun and a heaven to win.</p>
      <p>The crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the heavens, passing over its usual round.... Men
          are still eating and drinking, planting and building,</p>
      <p>marrying, and giving in marriage. Merchants are still buying and selling. Men are jostling one against another,
          contending for the highest place. Pleasure lovers are still crowding to theaters, horse races, gambling hells.
          The highest excitement prevails, yet probation’s hour is fast closing, and every case is about to be eternally
          decided....</p>
      <p>Solemnly there come to us down through the centuries the warning words of our Lord from the Mount of Olives:
          “Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and
          cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.”</p>
