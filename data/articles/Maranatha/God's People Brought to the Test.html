    <h1>Chap. 201—God’s People Brought to the Test</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have
          cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew
          you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Matthew 7:22, 23.</strong></p>
      <p>We need not be deceived. Wonderful scenes, with which Satan will be closely connected, will soon take place.
          God’s Word declares that Satan will work miracles. He will make people sick, and then will suddenly remove
          from them his satanic power. They will then be regarded as healed. These works of apparent healing will bring
          <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists to the test. Many who have had great light will fail to walk in the light,
          because they have not become one with Christ.</p>
      <p>I saw our people in great distress, weeping, and praying, pleading the sure promises of God, while the wicked
          were all around us, mocking us, and threatening to destroy us. They ridiculed our feebleness, they mocked at
          the smallness of our numbers, and taunted us with words calculated to cut deep. They charged us with taking an
          independent position from all the rest of the world. They had cut off our resources so that we could not buy
          nor sell, and referred to our abject poverty and stricken condition. They could not see how we could live
          without the world; we were dependent upon the world, and we must concede to the customs, practices, and laws
          of the world, or go out of it. If we were the only people in the world whom the Lord favored the appearances
          were awfully against us. They declared that they had the truth, that miracles were among them, that angels
          from heaven talked with them, and walked with them, that great power, and signs and wonders were performed
          among them, and this was the Temporal Millennium, which they had been expecting so long. The whole world was
          converted and in harmony with the Sunday law, and this little feeble people stood out in deﬁance of the laws
          of the land, and the laws of God, and claimed to be the only ones right on the earth.</p>
      <p>God’s people will not ﬁnd their safety in working miracles, for Satan would counterfeit any miracle that might
          be worked.... They are to take their stand on the</p>
      <p>living <nobr>Word—“It</nobr> is written.”</p>
