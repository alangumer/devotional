    <h1>Chap. 300—Families will be Reunited</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be
          rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine
          end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border. Jeremiah 31:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is coming with clouds and with great glory. A multitude of shining angels will attend Him. He will come
          to raise the dead, and to change the living saints from glory to glory. He will come to honor those who have
          loved Him, and kept His commandments, and to take them to Himself. He has not forgotten them nor His promise.
          There will be a relinking of the family chain.</p>
      <p>The day of God will reveal how much the world owes to godly mothers....</p>
      <p>When the judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened; when the “well done” of the great Judge is
          pronounced, and the crown of immortal glory is placed upon the brow of the victor, many will raise their
          crowns in sight of the assembled universe, and pointing to their mother say: “She made me all I am through the
          grace of God. Her instruction, her prayers, have been blessed to my eternal salvation.”</p>
      <p>With joy unutterable, parents see the crown, the robe, the harp, given to their children. The days of hope and
          fear are ended. The seed sown with tears and prayers may have seemed to be sown in vain, but their harvest is
          reaped with joy at last. Their children have been redeemed.</p>
      <p>Oh, wonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with eager anticipation, but never fully
          understood.</p>
      <p>To His faithful followers Christ has been a daily companion and familiar friend. They have lived in close
          contact, in constant communion with God. Upon them the glory of the Lord has risen. In them the light of the
          knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ has been reﬂected. Now they rejoice in the undimmed
          rays of the brightness and glory of the King in His majesty. They are prepared for the communion of heaven;
          for they have heaven in their hearts.</p>
