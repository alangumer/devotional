    <h1>Chap. 319—We shall See the King</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. Isaiah
          33:17.</strong></p>
      <p>If we desire to see the King in His beauty we must here behave worthily. We must outgrow our childishness. When
          provocation comes let us be silent. There are times when silence is eloquence. We are to reveal the patience
          and kindness and forbearance that will make us worthy of being called sons and daughters of God. We are to
          trust Him, and believe on Him, and rely upon Him. We are to follow in Christ’s steps. “If any man will come
          after me,” He says, “let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23).... It may
          be a heavy cross to</p>
      <p>keep silent when you ought to. It may be a painful discipline, but let me assure you that silence does much
          more to overcome evil than a storm of angry words.</p>
      <p>Here in this world we are to learn what we must be in order to have a place in the heavenly courts. We are to
          learn the lessons that Christ desires to teach us, that we may be prepared to be taken to the higher school in
          the courts above, where the Saviour will lead us beside the river of life, explaining to us many things that
          here we could not comprehend.... There we shall see the glory of God as we have never</p>
      <p>seen it here. We get but a glimpse of the glory now, because we do not follow on to know the Lord.</p>
      <p>Every right principle, every truth learned in an earthly school, will advance us just that much in the heavenly
          school. As Christ walked and talked with His disciples during His ministry on this earth, so will He teach us
          in the school above, leading us beside the river of living waters, and revealing to us truths that in this
          life must remain hidden mysteries because of the limitations of the human mind, so marred by sin. In the
          heavenly school we shall have opportunity to attain, step by step, to the greatest heights of learning. There,
          as children of the heavenly King, we shall ever dwell with the members of the royal family; there we shall see
          the King in His beauty, and behold His matchless charms.</p>
      <p>Long have we waited, but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can but see the King in His beauty we shall be
          forever blessed.</p>
