    <h1>Chap. 291—The General Resurrection of the Righteous</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out
          the dead. Isaiah 26:19.</strong></p>
      <p>The King of kings descends upon the cloud, wrapped in ﬂaming ﬁre. The heavens are rolled together as a scroll,
          the earth trembles before Him, and every mountain and island is moved out of its place....</p>
      <p>Amid the reeling of the earth, the ﬂash of lightning, and the roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God
          calls forth the sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then, raising His hands to heaven,
          He cries: “Awake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust, and arise!” Throughout the length and breadth of
          the earth the dead shall hear that voice, and they that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with
          the tread of the exceeding great army of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. From the prison house of
          death they come, clothed with immortal glory, crying: “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
          victory?” 1 Corinthians 15:55. And the living righteous and the risen saints unite their voices in a long,
          glad shout of victory.</p>
      <p>All come forth from their graves the same in stature as when they entered the tomb.... But all arise with the
          freshness and vigor of eternal youth.... The mortal,</p>
      <p>corruptible form, devoid of comeliness, once polluted with sin, becomes perfect, beautiful, and immortal. All
          blemishes and deformities are left in the grave....</p>
      <p>The living righteous are changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” At the voice of God they were
          gloriﬁed; now they are made immortal and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air.
          Angels “gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”</p>
      <p>As the little infants come forth immortal from their dusty beds, they immediately wing their way to their
          mothers’ arms.</p>
      <p>Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs of gladness ascend together to
          the City of God.</p>
