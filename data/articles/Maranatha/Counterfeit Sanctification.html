    <h1>Chap. 224—Counterfeit Sanctiﬁcation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
          But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 1
          John 2:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>The sanctiﬁcation now gaining prominence in the religious world carries with it a spirit of
          <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> and a disregard for the law of God that mark it as foreign to the religion of the
          Bible. Its advocates teach that sanctiﬁcation is an instantaneous work, by which, through faith alone, they
          attain to perfect holiness. “Only believe,” say they, “and the blessing is yours.” No further effort on the
          part of the receiver is supposed to be required. At the same time they deny the authority of the law of God,
          urging that they are released from obligation to keep the commandments. But is it possible for men to be holy,
          in accord with the will and character of God, without coming into harmony with the principles which are an
          expression of His nature and will ...?</p>
      <p>The desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> no divorce from the
          follies of the world, has made the doctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what saith the
          word of God? Says the apostle James: “What doth it proﬁt, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and
          have not works? can faith save him? ... Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
      <p>...”</p>
      <p>The testimony of the word of God is against this ensnaring doctrine of faith without works. It is not faith
          that claims the favor of Heaven without complying with the conditions upon which mercy is to be granted, it is
          presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation in the promises and provisions of the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>Let none deceive themselves with the belief that they can become holy while willfully violating one of God’s
          requirements. The commission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit and separates the soul
          from God.... “He</p>
      <p>that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso
          keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected” (1 John 2:4, 5).</p>
