    <h1>Chap. 183—Satan and the Threefold Union</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast. Revelation 13:4.</strong></p>
      <p>“He had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” Though professing to be followers of the Lamb of God,
          men become imbued with the spirit of the dragon. They profess to be meek and humble but they speak and
          legislate with the spirit of Satan, showing by their actions that they are the opposite of what they profess
          to be. This <nobr>lamb-like</nobr> power unites with the dragon in making war upon those who keep the
          commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. And Satan unites with Protestants and Papists,
          acting in consort with them as the God of this world, dictating to men as if they were the subjects of his
          kingdom, to be handled and governed and controlled as he pleases. If men will not agree to trample under foot
          the commandments of God, the spirit of the dragon is revealed. They are imprisoned, brought before councils,
          and ﬁned. “He causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their
          right hand, or in their foreheads.” “He had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of
          the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
          killed.” Thus Satan usurps the prerogatives of Jehovah. The man of sin sits in the seat of God, proclaiming
          himself to be God, and acting above God.</p>
      <p>There is a marked contrast between those who bear the seal of God and those who worship the beast and his
          image. The Lord’s faithful servants will receive the bitterest persecution from false teachers, who will not
          hear the word of God, and who prepare stumbling blocks to put in the way of those who would hear. But God’s
          people are not to fear. Satan cannot go beyond his limit. The Lord will be the defense of His people. He
          regards the injury done to His servants for the truth’s sake as done to Himself. When the last decision has
          been made, when all have taken sides, either for Christ and the commandments or for the great apostate, God
          will arise in His power, and the mouths of those who have blasphemed against Him will be forever stopped.
          Every opposing power will receive its punishment.</p>
