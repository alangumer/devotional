    <h1>Chap. 210—The Angel of Revelation 18</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was
          lightened with his glory. Revelation 18:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The prophecies in the eighteenth of Revelation will soon be fulﬁlled. During the proclamation of the third
          angel’s message, “another angel” is to “come down from heaven, having great power,” and the earth is to be
          “lightened with his glory.” The Spirit of the Lord will so graciously bless consecrated human
          instrumentalities that men, women, and children will open their lips in praise and thanksgiving, ﬁlling the
          earth with the knowledge of God, and with His unsurpassed glory, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
      <p>Those who have held the beginning of their conﬁdence ﬁrm unto the end will be <nobr>wide-awake</nobr> during
          the time that the third angel’s message is proclaimed with great power. During the loud cry, the church, aided
          by the providential interpositions of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the knowledge of salvation so abundantly
          that light will be communicated to every city and town. The earth will be ﬁlled with the knowledge of
          salvation. So abundantly will the renewing Spirit of God have crowned with success the intensely active
          agencies, that the light of present truth will be seen ﬂashing everywhere.</p>
      <p>There is to be, at this period, a series of events which will reveal that God is Master of the situation. The
          truth will be proclaimed in clear, unmistakable language. As a people, we must prepare the way of the Lord,
          under the overruling guidance of the Holy Spirit. The gospel is to be given in its purity. The stream of
          living water is to deepen and widen in its course. In all ﬁelds, nigh and afar off, men will be called from
          the plow and from the more common commercial business vocations that largely occupy the mind, and will be
          educated in connection with men of experience. As they learn to labor effectively, they will proclaim the
          truth with power. Through most wonderful workings of divine providence, mountains of difﬁculties will be
          removed, and cast into the sea. The message that means so much to the dwellers upon the earth will be heard
          and understood. Men will know what is truth. Onward, and still onward the work will advance, until the whole
          earth shall have been warned. And then shall the end come.</p>
