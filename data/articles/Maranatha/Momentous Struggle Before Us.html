    <h1>Chap. 123—Momentous Struggle Before Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We ought to obey God rather than men. Acts 5:29.</strong></p>
      <p>A great crisis awaits the people of God. A crisis awaits the world. The most momentous struggle of all the ages
          is just before us.... The question of enforcing</p>
      <p>Sunday observance has become one of national interest and importance. We well know what the result of this
          movement will be. But are we ready for the issue? Have we faithfully discharged the duty which God has
          committed to us of giving the people warning of the danger before them? ...</p>
      <p>There are many who have never understood the claims of the Bible Sabbath and the false foundation upon which
          the Sunday institution rests. Any movement in favor of religious legislation is really an act of concession to
          the papacy, which for so many ages has steadily warred against liberty of conscience. Sunday observance owes
          its existence as a <nobr>so-called</nobr> Christian institution to “the mystery of iniquity”; and its
          enforcement will be a virtual recognition of the principles which are the very cornerstone of Romanism. When
          our nation shall so abjure the principles of its government as to enact a Sunday law, Protestantism will in
          this act join hands with popery; it will be nothing else than giving life to the tyranny which has long been
          eagerly watching its opportunity to spring again into active despotism....</p>
      <p>If popery or its principles shall again be legislated into power, the ﬁres of persecution will be rekindled
          against those who will not sacriﬁce conscience and the truth in deference to popular errors. This evil is on
          the point of realization.</p>
      <p>When God has given us light showing the dangers before us, how can we stand clear in His sight if we neglect to
          put forth every effort in our power to bring it before the people? Can we be content to leave them to meet
          this momentous issue unwarned? ...</p>
      <p>When the laws of earthly rulers are brought into opposition to the laws of the Supreme Ruler of the universe,
          then those who are God’s loyal subjects will be true to Him.</p>
