    <h1>Chap. 251—A Little Time of Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
          woman with child; and they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3.</strong></p>
      <p>While the work of salvation is closing, trouble will be coming on the earth, and the nations will be angry, yet
          held in check so as not to prevent the work of the third angel. At that time the “latter rain,” or refreshing
          from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the third angel, and prepare the
          saints to stand in the period when the seven last plagues shall be poured out.</p>
      <p>I was shown the inhabitants of the earth in the utmost confusion. War, bloodshed, privation, want, famine, and
          pestilence were abroad in the land. As these things surrounded God’s people, they began to press together, and
          to cast aside their little difﬁculties. <nobr>Self-dignity</nobr> no longer controlled them; deep humility
          took its place. Suffering, perplexity, and privation caused reason to resume its throne, and the passionate
          and unreasonable man became sane, and acted with discretion and wisdom.</p>
      <p>My attention was then called from the scene. There seemed to be a little time of peace. Once more the
          inhabitants of the earth were presented before me; and again everything was in the utmost confusion. Strife,
          war, and bloodshed, with famine and pestilence, raged everywhere. Other nations were engaged in this war and
          confusion. War caused famine. Want and bloodshed caused pestilence. And then men’s hearts failed them for
          fear, “and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”</p>
      <p>Angels are now restraining the winds of strife, until the world shall be warned of its coming doom; but a storm
          is gathering, ready to burst upon the earth, and when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there will be
          such a scene of strife as no pen can picture....</p>
      <p>A moment of respite has been graciously given us of God. Every power lent us of heaven is to be used in doing
          the work assigned us by the Lord for those who are perishing in ignorance.</p>
