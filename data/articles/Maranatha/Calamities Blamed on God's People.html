    <h1>Chap. 168—Calamities Blamed on God’s People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great
          wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12.</strong></p>
      <p>As men depart further and further from God, Satan is permitted to have power over the children of disobedience.
          He hurls destruction among men. There is calamity by land and sea. Property and life are destroyed by ﬁre and
          ﬂood. Satan resolves to charge this upon those who refuse to bow to the idol which he has set up. His agents
          point to <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists as the cause of the trouble. “These people stand out in deﬁance
          of law,” they say. “They desecrate Sunday. Were they compelled to obey the law for Sunday observance, there
          would be a cessation of these terrible judgments.”</p>
      <p>Calamities will <nobr>come—calamities</nobr> most awful, most unexpected; and these destructions will follow
          one after another. If there will be a heeding of the warnings that God has given, and if churches will repent,
          returning to their allegiance, then other cities may be spared for a time. But if men who have been deceived
          continue in the same way in which they have been walking, disregarding the law of God and presenting
          falsehoods before the people, God allows them to suffer calamity, that their senses may be awakened.</p>
      <p>The judgments will be according to the wickedness of the people and the light of truth that they have had. If
          they have had the truth, according to that light will be the punishment.</p>
      <p>Satan puts his interpretation upon events, and they [leading men] think, as he would have them, that the
          calamities which ﬁll the land are a result of <nobr>Sunday-breaking.</nobr> Thinking to appease the wrath of
          God, these inﬂuential men make laws enforcing Sunday observance. They think that by exalting this false
          <nobr>rest-day</nobr> higher, and still higher, compelling obedience to the Sunday law, the spurious sabbath,
          they are doing God service. Those who honor God by observing the true Sabbath are looked upon as disloyal to
          God, when it is really those who thus regard them who are themselves disloyal, because they are trampling
          under foot the Sabbath originated in Eden.</p>
