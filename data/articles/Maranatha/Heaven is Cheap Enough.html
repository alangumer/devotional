    <h1>Chap. 310—Heaven is Cheap Enough</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
          hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisﬁed. Isaiah 53:10, 11.</strong></p>
      <p>The love of God is without measure, without comparison! It is inﬁnite.... When</p>
      <p>we contemplate the dignity and glory of Christ we see how great was that love that prompted the sacriﬁce made
          upon the cross of Calvary for the redemption of a lost world. This theme will ﬁll the saints with wonder and
          amazement through eternal ages, and why should we not meditate upon it here in this world? ...</p>
      <p>O the mystery of <nobr>godliness—God</nobr> manifest in the ﬂesh! This mystery increases as we try to
          comprehend it. It is incomprehensible, and yet human beings will allow worldly, earthly things to intercept
          the faint view it is possible for mortals to have of Jesus and His matchless love.... How can we be
          enthusiastic over earthly, common</p>
      <p>things and not be stirred with this <nobr>picture—the</nobr> cross of Calvary, the love that is revealed in the
          death of God’s dear Son ...?</p>
      <p>All this humiliation and anguish were endured to bring back the wanderers, guilty and thankless, to the
          Father’s house. O the home of the <nobr>blest—I</nobr> cannot afford to lose it! I shall, if saved in the
          kingdom of God, be constantly discerning new depths in the plan of salvation. All the redeemed saints will see
          and appreciate as never before the love of the Father and the Son, and songs of praise will burst forth from
          immortal tongues. He loved us, He gave His life for us. With gloriﬁed bodies, with enlarged capacities, with
          hearts made pure, with lips undeﬁled, we shall sing the riches of redeeming love. There will be no suffering
          ones in heaven, no skeptics whom we must labor to convince of the reality of eternal things, no prejudices to
          uproot, but all will be susceptible to that love which passeth knowledge. Rest, thank God, there is a rest for
          the people of God, where Jesus will lead the redeemed into green pastures, by the streams of living waters
          which make glad the city of our God. Then the prayer of Jesus to His Father will be answered: “I will that
          they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.”</p>
