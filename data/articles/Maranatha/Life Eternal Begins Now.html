    <h1>Chap. 294—Life Eternal Begins Now</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 1 John
          5:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The resurrection of Jesus was a sample of the ﬁnal resurrection of all who sleep in Him.</p>
      <p>He [the Christian] may die; but the life of Christ is in him, and at the resurrection of the just he will rise
          to newness of life.</p>
      <p>“In him [Christ] was life; and the life was the light of men.” It is not physical life that is here speciﬁed,
          but immortality, the life which is exclusively the property of God. The Word, who was with God, and who was
          God, had this life. Physical life is something which each individual receives. It is not eternal or immortal;
          for God, the <nobr>Life-giver,</nobr> takes it again. Man has no control over his life. But the life of Christ
          was unborrowed. No one can take this life from Him. “I lay it down of myself,” He said. In Him was life,
          original, unborrowed, underived. This life is not inherent in man. He can possess it only through Christ.</p>
      <p>While bearing human nature, He [Christ] was dependent upon the Omnipotent for His life. In His humanity, He
          laid hold of the divinity of God; and this every member of the human family has the privilege of
          doing....</p>
      <p>If we repent of our transgression, and receive Christ as the <nobr>Life-giver, ...</nobr> we become one with
          Him, and our will is brought into harmony with the divine will. We become partakers of the life of Christ,
          which is eternal. We derive immortality from God by receiving the life of Christ, for in Christ dwells all the
          fulness of the Godhead bodily. This life is the mystical union and cooperation of the divine with the
          human.</p>
      <p>Christ became one ﬂesh with us, in order that we might become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this
          union that we are to come forth from the <nobr>grave—not</nobr> merely as a manifestation of the power of
          Christ, but because, through faith, His life has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true character, and
          receive Him into the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the
          Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal.</p>
