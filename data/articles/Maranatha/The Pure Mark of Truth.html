    <h1>Chap. 232—The Pure Mark of Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a
          mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst
          thereof. Ezekiel 9:4.</strong></p>
      <p>Mark this point with care: Those who receive the pure mark of truth, wrought in them by the power of the Holy
          Ghost, represented by a mark by the man in linen, are those “that sigh and that cry for all the abominations
          that be done” in the church.</p>
      <p>The class who do not feel grieved over their own spiritual declension, nor mourn over the sins of others, will
          be left without the seal of God....</p>
      <p>Not all who profess to keep the Sabbath will be sealed. There are many even among those who teach the truth to
          others who will not receive the seal of God in their foreheads. They had the light of truth, they knew their
          Master’s will, they understood every point of our faith, but they had not corresponding works....</p>
      <p>Not one of us will ever receive the seal of God while our characters have one spot or stain upon them. It is
          left with us to remedy the defects in our characters, to cleanse the soul temple of every deﬁlement. Then the
          latter rain will fall upon us as the early rain fell upon the disciples....</p>
      <p>What are you doing, brethren, in the great work of preparation? Those who are uniting with the world are
          receiving the worldly mold and preparing for the mark of the beast. Those who are distrustful of self, who are
          humbling themselves before God and purifying their souls by obeying the <nobr>truth—these</nobr> are receiving
          the heavenly mold and preparing for the seal of God in their foreheads. When the decree goes forth and the
          stamp is impressed, their character will remain pure and spotless for eternity.</p>
      <p>Now is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be placed upon the forehead of an impure man or woman.
          It will never be placed upon the forehead of the ambitious, <nobr>world-loving</nobr> man or woman. It will
          never be placed upon the forehead of men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts. All who receive the
          seal must be without spot before <nobr>God—candidates</nobr> for heaven.</p>
