    <h1>Chap. 330—The Wicked Prepare to Attack the New Jerusalem</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Satan ... shall go out to deceive the nations ... to gather them together to battle. Revelation 20:7,
          8.</strong></p>
      <p>In that vast throng are multitudes of the <nobr>long-lived</nobr> race that existed before the Flood; men of
          lofty stature and giant intellect, who, yielding to the control of fallen angels, devoted all their skill and
          knowledge to the exaltation of themselves; men whose wonderful works of art led the world to idolize their
          genius, but whose cruelty and evil inventions, deﬁling the earth and defacing the image of God, caused Him to
          blot them from the face of His creation. There are kings and generals who conquered nations, valiant men who
          never lost a battle, proud, ambitious warriors whose approach made kingdoms tremble. In death these
          experienced no change. As they come up from the grave, they resume the current of their thoughts just where it
          ceased. They are actuated by the same desire to conquer that ruled them when they fell.</p>
      <p>Satan consults with his angels, and then with these kings and conquerors and mighty men. They look upon the
          strength and numbers on their side, and declare that the army within the city is small in comparison with
          theirs, and that it can be overcome. They lay their plans to take possession of the riches and glory of the
          New Jerusalem. All immediately begin to prepare for battle. Skillful artisans construct implements of war.
          Military leaders, famed for their success, marshal the throngs of warlike men into companies and
          divisions.</p>
      <p>At last the order to advance is given, and the countless host moves <nobr>on—an</nobr> army such as was never
          summoned by earthly conquerors, such as the combined forces of all ages since war began on earth could never
          equal. Satan, the mightiest of warriors, leads the van, and his angels unite their forces for this ﬁnal
          struggle. Kings and warriors are in his train, and the multitudes follow in vast companies, each under its
          appointed leader. With military precision the serried ranks advance over the earth’s broken and uneven surface
          to the City of God. By command of Jesus, the gates of the New Jerusalem are closed, and the armies of Satan
          surround the city and make ready for the onset.</p>
