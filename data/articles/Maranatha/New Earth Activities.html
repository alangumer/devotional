      <p><strong>They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
          They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree
          are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. Isaiah 65:21,
          22.</strong></p>
      <p>We cannot suppose that when the ﬁnal triumph shall come, and we have the mansions prepared for us, idleness
          will be our <nobr>portion—that</nobr> we shall rest in a blissful, <nobr>do-nothing</nobr> state.</p>
      <p>In the earth made new, the redeemed will engage in the occupations and pleasures that brought happiness to Adam
          and Eve in the beginning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and ﬁeld. “They shall build houses,
          and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another
          inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine
          elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.” Isaiah 65:21, 22.</p>
      <p>There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls
          most glorious to behold. These were to be inhabited by the saints. In each was a golden shelf. I saw many of
          the saints go into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into
          the ﬁeld by the houses to do something with the earth; not as we have to do with the earth here; no, no. A
          glorious light shone all about their heads, and they were continually shouting and offering praises to
          God.</p>
      <p>Every faculty will be developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge will not weary the mind
          or exhaust the energies. There the grandest enterprises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations
          reached, the highest ambitions realized; and still there will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to
          admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of mind and soul and body.</p>
