    <h1>Chap. 284—Judgment at the Second Advent</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead
          at his appearing and his kingdom. 2 Timothy 4:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The judgment scene will take place in the presence of all the worlds; for in this judgment the government of
          God will be vindicated, and His law will stand forth as “holy, and just, and good.” Then every case will be
          decided, and sentence will be passed upon all. Sin will not then appear attractive, but will be seen in all
          its hideous magnitude.</p>
      <p>No human language can portray the scenes of the second coming of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven. He is
          to come with His own glory, and with the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. He will come clad in the
          robe of light, which He has worn from the days of eternity. Angels will accompany Him. Ten thousand times ten
          thousand will escort Him on His way. The sound of the trumpet will be heard, calling the sleeping dead from
          the grave. The voice of Christ will penetrate the tomb, and pierce the ears of the dead, “and all that are in
          the graves ... shall come forth.”</p>
      <p>“And before him shall be gathered all nations.” The very One who died for man is to judge him in the last day:
          for the Father “hath committed all judgment unto the Son: ... and hath given him authority to execute judgment
          also, because he is the Son of man.” What a day that will be, when those who rejected Christ will look upon
          Him whom their sins have pierced.</p>
      <p>At His second coming, conviction will be brought to every heart. Those who have turned from Him to the trivial
          things of this earth, seeking selﬁsh interests and worldly honor, will in the day of His coming acknowledge
          their mistake. These are the ones spoken of by the Revelator as “all kindreds of the earth,” who “shall wail
          because of him.” ...</p>
      <p>“And they also which pierced him.” These words apply not only to the men who pierced Christ when He hung on the
          cross of Calvary, but to those who by <nobr>evil-speaking</nobr> and <nobr>wrong-doing</nobr> are piercing Him
          today.</p>
