    <h1>Chap. 362—Christ’s Kingdom of Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to
          the people of the saints of the most High. Daniel 7:27.</strong></p>
      <p>The government of the kingdom of Christ is like no earthly government. It is a representation of the characters
          of those who compose the kingdom.... His court is</p>
      <p>one where holy love presides and whose ofﬁces and appointments are graced by the exercise of charity. He
          charges His servants to bring pity and <nobr>loving-kindness,</nobr> His own attributes, into all their ofﬁce
          work....</p>
      <p>The power of Christ alone can work the transformation in heart and mind that all must experience who would
          partake with Him of the new life in the kingdom of God.... In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of
          the divine Spirit. This will</p>
      <p>purify the heart and renew the mind and give us a new capacity for knowing and loving God. It will give us
          willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true worship.</p>
      <p>“Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the
          stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the glorious
          Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams.... For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our
          lawgiver, the</p>
      <p>Lord is our king; he will save us.... And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the</p>
      <p>people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity” (Isaiah <nobr>33:20-24).</nobr></p>
      <p>“Be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create,” the Lord exhorts; “for, behold, I create Jerusalem a
          rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of
          weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.... And they shall build houses, and inhabit
          them;</p>
      <p>and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they
          shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall
          long enjoy the work of their hands.... They</p>
      <p>shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord” (Isaiah <nobr>65:18-25).</nobr></p>
