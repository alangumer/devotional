      <p><strong>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
          perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Why are not all who claim to love God seeking to enlighten their neighbors and their associates, that they may
          not longer neglect this great salvation? Christ gave Himself to a shameful, agonizing death, showing His great
          travail of soul to save the perishing. Oh, Christ is able, Christ is willing, Christ is longing, to save all
          who will come unto Him!</p>
      <p>Talk to souls in peril and get them to behold Jesus upon the cross, dying to make it possible for Him to
          pardon. Talk to the sinner with your own heart overﬂowing with the tender, pitying love of Christ. Let there
          be deep earnestness; but not a harsh, loud note should be heard from the one who is trying to win the soul to
          look and live.</p>
      <p>First have your own soul consecrated to God. As you look upon our Intercessor in heaven, let your heart be
          broken. Then, softened and subdued, you can address repenting sinners as one who realizes the power of
          redeeming love. Pray with these souls, by faith bringing them to the foot of the cross; carry their minds up
          with your mind, and ﬁx the eye of faith where you look, upon Jesus the Sin Bearer. Get them to look away from
          their poor, sinful selves to the Saviour, and the victory is won. They behold for themselves the Lamb of God
          that taketh away the sin of the world. They see the Way, the Truth, the Life. The Sun of Righteousness sheds
          its bright beams into the heart. The strong tide of redeeming love pours into the parched and thirsty soul,
          and the sinner is saved to Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Christ <nobr>cruciﬁed—talk</nobr> it, pray it, sing it, and it will break and win hearts. This is the power and
          wisdom of God to gather souls for Christ. Formal, set phrases, the presentation of merely argumentative
          subjects, is productive of little good. The melting love of God in the hearts of the workers will be
          recognized by those for whom they labor. Souls are thirsting for the waters of life. Do not be empty cisterns.
          If you reveal the love of Christ to them, you may lead the hungering, thirsting ones to Jesus, and He will
          give them the bread of life and the water of salvation.</p>
