    <h1>Chap. 305—The Captivity of Satan and His Angels</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The angels which kept not their ﬁrst estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in
          everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Jude 6.</strong></p>
      <p>The earth looked like a desolate wilderness. Cities and villages, shaken down by the earthquake, lay in heaps.
          Mountains had been moved out of their places, leaving large caverns. Ragged rocks, thrown out by the sea, or
          torn out of the earth itself, were scattered all over its surface. Large trees had been uprooted and were
          strewn over the land. Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years.</p>
      <p>Here he will be conﬁned, to wander up and down over the broken surface of the earth and see the effects of his
          rebellion against God’s law. For a thousand years he can enjoy the fruit of the curse which he has caused.
          Limited alone to the earth, he will not have the privilege of ranging to other planets, to tempt and annoy
          those who have not fallen. During this time, Satan suffers extremely. Since his fall his evil traits have been
          in constant exercise. But he is then to be deprived of his power, and left to reﬂect upon the part which he
          has acted since his fall, and to look forward with trembling and terror to the dreadful future, when he must
          suffer for all the evil that he has done and be punished for all the sins that he has caused to be
          committed.</p>
      <p>I heard shouts of triumph from the angels and from the redeemed saints, which sounded like ten thousand musical
          instruments, because they were to be no more annoyed and tempted by Satan and because the inhabitants of other
          worlds were delivered from his presence and his temptations.</p>
      <p>To God’s people the captivity of Satan will bring gladness and rejoicing. Says the prophet: “It shall come to
          pass in the day that Jehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and from the hard
          service wherein thou wast made to serve, that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon
          [here representing Satan], and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! ... Jehovah hath broken the staff of the
          wicked, the scepter of the rulers; that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled the
          nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.” Verses <nobr>3-6,</nobr> R.V.</p>
