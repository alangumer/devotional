    <h1>Chap. 339—Sin and Sinners Destroyed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly,
          shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave
          them neither root nor branch. Malachi 4:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Notwithstanding that Satan has been constrained to acknowledge God’s justice and to bow to the supremacy of
          Christ, his character remains unchanged. The spirit of rebellion, like a mighty torrent, again bursts forth.
          Filled with frenzy, he determines not to yield the great controversy. The time has come for a last desperate
          struggle against the King of heaven. He rushes into the midst of his subjects and endeavors to inspire them
          with his own fury and arouse them to instant battle. But of all the countless millions whom he has allured
          into rebellion, there are none now to acknowledge his supremacy. His power is at an end. The wicked are ﬁlled
          with the same hatred of God that inspires Satan; but they see that their case is hopeless, that they cannot
          prevail against Jehovah. Their rage is kindled against Satan and those who have been his agents in deception,
          and with the fury of demons they turn upon them.</p>
      <p>Saith the Lord: “Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; behold, therefore I will bring
          strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy
          wisdom, and they shall deﬁle thy brightness. They shall bring thee down to the pit.” “I will destroy thee, O
          covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of ﬁre.... I will cast thee to the ground, I will</p>
      <p>lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.... I will bring thee to ashes upon</p>
      <p>the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.... Thou shalt be a terror, and never</p>
      <p>shalt thou be any more.” Ezekiel <nobr>28:6-8,</nobr><nobr>16-19....</nobr></p>
      <p>Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn
          forth. Devouring ﬂames burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on ﬁre. The day has come that shall
          burn as an oven. The elements melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are
          burned up.</p>
