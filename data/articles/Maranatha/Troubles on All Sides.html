    <h1>Chap. 29—Troubles on All Sides</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek
          meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger. Zephaniah 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>There is no sadder spectacle than that of those who have been purchased by the blood of Christ ... turning to
          jest the messages graciously sent to them in the gospel, denying the divinity of Christ, and trusting to their
          own ﬁnite reasoning, and to arguments that have no foundation. When tested with afﬂiction, when brought face
          to face with death, all these fallacies they have cherished will be melted away like frost before the
          sun.</p>
      <p>How terrible it is to stand by the cofﬁn of one who has rejected the appeals of divine mercy! How terrible to
          say: Here is a life lost! Here is one who might have reached the highest standard, and gained immortal life,
          but he surrendered his life to Satan, became ensnared by the vain philosophies of men, and was a plaything of
          the evil one! The Christian’s hope is an anchor to the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entereth into that
          which is within the veil, whither Christ the forerunner is for us entered. We have an individual work to do to
          prepare for the great events that are before us.</p>
      <p>The youth should seek God more earnestly. The tempest is coming, and we must get ready for its fury by having
          repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord will arise to shake terribly the earth.
          We shall see troubles on all sides. Thousands of ships will be hurled into the depths of the sea. Navies will
          go down, and human lives will be sacriﬁced by millions. Fires will break out unexpectedly, and no human effort
          will be able to quench them. The palaces of earth will be swept away in the fury of the ﬂames. Disasters by
          rail will become more and more frequent; confusion, collision, and death without a moment’s warning will occur
          on the great lines of travel. The end is near, probation is closing. Oh, let us seek God while He may be
          found, call upon Him while He is near! The prophet says: “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which
          have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the
          Lord’s anger.”</p>
