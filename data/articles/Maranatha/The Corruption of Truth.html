    <h1>Chap. 184—The Corruption of Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. Matthew
          24:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Before the last developments of the work of apostasy there will be a confusion of faith. There will not be
          clear and deﬁnite ideas concerning the mystery of God. One truth after another will be corrupted.</p>
      <p>After the truth has been proclaimed as a witness to all nations, every conceivable power of evil will be set in
          operation, and minds will be confused by many voices crying. “Lo, here is Christ; lo, He is there. This is the
          truth, I have the message from God, He has sent me with great light.” Then there will be a removing of the
          landmarks, and an attempt to tear down the pillars of our faith. A more decided effort will be made to exalt
          the false sabbath, and to cast contempt upon God Himself by supplanting the day He has blessed and sanctiﬁed.
          This false sabbath is to be enforced by an oppressive law.</p>
      <p>In the future, deception of every kind is to arise, and we want solid ground for our feet. We want solid
          pillars for the building. Not one pin is to be removed from that which the Lord has established. The enemy
          will bring in false theories, such as the doctrine that there is no sanctuary. This is one of the points on
          which there will be a departing from the faith.</p>
      <p>There will be false dreams and false visions, which have some truth, but lead away from the original faith. The
          Lord has given men a rule by which to detect them: “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
          according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20).</p>
      <p>As we near the end of time, falsehood will be so mingled with truth, that only those who have the guidance of
          the Holy Spirit will be able to distinguish truth from error. We need to make every effort to keep the way of
          the Lord. We must in no case turn from His guidance to put our trust in man. The Lord’s angels are appointed
          to keep strict watch over those who put their faith in the Lord, and these angels are to be our special help
          in every time of need. Every day we are to come to the Lord with full assurance of faith, and to look to Him
          for wisdom.... Those who</p>
      <p>are guided by the Word of the Lord will discern with certainty between falsehood and truth, between sin and
          righteousness.</p>
