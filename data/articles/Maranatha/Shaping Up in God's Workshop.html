    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You
          are not your own; you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>We are not our own. We have been purchased with a dear price, even the sufferings and death of the Son of God.
          If we could understand this, and fully realize it, we would feel a great responsibility resting upon us to
          keep ourselves in the very best condition of health, that we might render to God perfect service....</p>
      <p>We believe without a doubt that Christ is soon coming.... We have no doubt,</p>
      <p>neither have we had a doubt for years, that the doctrines we hold today are present truth, and that we are
          nearing the judgment. We are preparing to meet Him who, escorted by a retinue of holy angels, is to appear in
          the clouds of heaven to give the faithful and the just the ﬁnishing touch of immortality. When He comes He is
          not to cleanse us of our sins, to remove from us the defects in our characters, or to cure us of the
          inﬁrmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought for us at all, this work will all be accomplished
          before that time.</p>
      <p>When the Lord comes, those who are holy will be holy still. Those who have preserved their bodies and spirits
          in holiness, in sanctiﬁcation and honor, will then receive the ﬁnishing touch of immortality. But those who
          are unjust, unsanctiﬁed, and ﬁlthy will remain so forever. No work will then be done for them to remove their
          defects and give them holy characters.... This is all to be done in these hours</p>
      <p>of probation. It is now that this work is to be accomplished for us....</p>
      <p>We are now in God’s workshop. Many of us are rough stones from the quarry. But as we lay hold upon the truth of
          God, its inﬂuence affects us. It elevates us and removes from us every imperfection and sin, of whatever
          nature. Thus we are prepared to see the King in His beauty and ﬁnally to unite with the pure and heavenly
          angels in the kingdom of glory. It is here that this work is to be accomplished for us, here that our bodies
          and spirits are to be ﬁtted for immortality.</p>
