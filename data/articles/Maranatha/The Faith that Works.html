    <h1>Chap. 50—The Faith that Works</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 1 Peter
          4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Do you believe that the end of all things is at hand, that the scenes of this earth’s history are fast closing?
          If so, show your faith by your works. A man will show all the faith he has. Some think they have a good degree
          of faith, when if they have any, it is dead, for it is not sustained by works. “Faith, if it hath not works,
          is dead, being alone.” Few have that genuine faith which works by love and puriﬁes the soul. But all who are
          accounted worthy of everlasting life must obtain a moral ﬁtness for the same. “Beloved, now are we the sons of
          God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like
          him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him puriﬁeth himself, even as he is
          pure.” This is the work before you....</p>
      <p>You must experience a death to self, and must live unto God. “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those
          things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.” Self is not to be consulted. Pride,
          <nobr>self-love,</nobr> selﬁshness, avarice, covetousness, love of the world, hatred, suspicion, jealousy,
          evil surmisings, must all be subdued and sacriﬁced forever. When Christ shall appear, it will not be to
          correct these evils and then give a moral ﬁtness for His coming. This preparation must all be made before He
          comes. It should be a subject of thought, of study, and earnest inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? What
          shall be our conduct that we may show ourselves approved of God?</p>
      <p>When tempted to murmur, censure, and indulge in fretfulness, wounding those around you, and in so doing
          wounding your own soul, oh! let the deep, earnest, anxious inquiry come from your soul, Shall I stand without
          fault before the throne of God? Only the faultless will be there. None will be translated to heaven while
          their hearts are ﬁlled with the rubbish of earth. Every defect in the moral character must ﬁrst be remedied,
          every stain removed by the cleansing blood of Christ, and all the unlovely, unlovable traits of character
          overcome.</p>
