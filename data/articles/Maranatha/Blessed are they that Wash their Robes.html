    <h1>Chap. 326—Blessed are they that Wash their Robes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right to come to the tree of life, and
          may enter in by the gates into the city. Revelation 22:14, R.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Do we expect to get to heaven at last and join the heavenly choir? Just as we go into the grave we will come
          up, as far as the character is concerned.... Now is the</p>
      <p>time for washing and ironing....</p>
      <p>John saw the throne of God and around that throne a company, and he inquired, Who are these? The answer came,
          “These are they which ... have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (Revelation
          7:14). Christ leads them to the fountains of living waters, and there is the tree of life and there is the
          precious Saviour. Here is presented to us a life that measures with the life of God. There is no pain, sorrow,
          sickness, or death there. All is peace and harmony and love....</p>
      <p>Now is the time to receive grace and strength and power to combine with our human efforts that we can form
          characters for everlasting life. When we do this we will ﬁnd that the angels of God will minister unto us, and
          we shall be heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. And when the last trump shall sound, and the dead
          shall be called from their prison house and changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the crowns of
          immortal glory shall be placed upon the heads of the overcomers. The pearly gates will swing back for the
          nations that have kept the truth and they will enter in. The conﬂict is ended.</p>
      <p>“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Matthew
          25:34). Do we want this benediction? I do, and I believe you do. May God help you that you may ﬁght the
          battles of this life and gain a victory day by day and at last be among the number that shall cast their
          crowns at Jesus’ feet and touch the golden harps and ﬁll all heaven with sweetest music. I want you to love my
          Jesus.... Do not reject my Saviour, for He has paid an inﬁnite</p>
      <p>price for you. I see in Jesus matchless charms, and I want you to see these charms.</p>
