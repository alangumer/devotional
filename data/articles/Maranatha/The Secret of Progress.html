    <h1>Chap. 78—The Secret of Progress</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Psalm
          62:8.</strong></p>
      <p>We must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the divine life. When the message of truth was ﬁrst
          proclaimed, how much we prayed. How often was the voice of intercession heard in the chamber, in the barn, in
          the orchard, or the grove. Frequently we spent hours in earnest prayer, two or three together claiming the
          promise; often the sound of weeping was heard and then the voice of thanksgiving and the song of praise. Now
          the day of God is nearer than when we ﬁrst believed, and we should be more earnest, more zealous, and fervent
          than in those early days. Our perils are greater now than then.</p>
      <p>It was in hours of solitary prayer that Jesus in His <nobr>earth-life</nobr> received wisdom and power. Let the
          youth follow His example in ﬁnding at dawn and twilight a quiet season for communion with their Father in
          heaven. And throughout the day let them lift up their hearts to God. At every step of our way He says, “I the
          Lord thy God will hold thy right hand; ... fear not; I will help thee.” Isaiah 41:13. Could our children learn
          this lesson in the morning of their years, what freshness and power, what joy and sweetness, would be brought
          into their lives!</p>
      <p>Let your heart break for the longing it has for God, for the living God. The life of Christ has shown what
          humanity can do by being partaker of the divine nature. All that Christ received from God we too may have.
          Then ask and receive. With the persevering faith of Jacob, with the unyielding persistence of Elijah, claim
          for yourself all that God has promised.</p>
      <p>Let the glorious conceptions of God possess your mind. Let your life be knit by hidden links to the life of
          Jesus. He who commanded the light to shine out of darkness is willing to shine in your heart, to give the
          light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit will take the things
          of God and show them unto you.... Christ will lead you to the threshold of the Inﬁnite. You</p>
      <p>may behold the glory beyond the veil, and reveal to men the sufﬁciency of Him who ever liveth to make
          intercession for us.</p>
