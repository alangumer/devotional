    <h1>Chap. 60—A Crisis Ahead</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it
          come. Joel 1:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The prophecies which the great I AM has given in His word, uniting link after link in the chain of events, from
          eternity in the past to eternity in the future, tell us where we are today in the procession of the ages, and
          what may be expected in the time to come. All that prophecy has foretold as coming to pass, until the present
          time, has been traced on the pages of history, and we may be assured that all which is yet to come will be
          fulﬁlled in its order.</p>
      <p>Today the signs of the times declare that we are standing on the threshold of great and solemn events.
          Everything in our world is in agitation. Before our eyes is fulﬁlling the Saviour’s prophecy of the events to
          precede His coming: “Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.... Nation shall rise against nation, and
          kingdom</p>
      <p>against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.”</p>
      <p>The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of
          trust and authority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention ﬁxed upon the events taking
          place about us. They are watching the relations that exist among the nations. They observe the intensity that
          is taking possession of every earthly element, and they recognize that something great and decisive is about
          to take <nobr>place—that</nobr> the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.</p>
      <p>The Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view of these things. Here are revealed the great ﬁnal scenes in
          the history of our world, ... the sound of their approach causing the earth to tremble and men’s hearts to
          fail them for fear.</p>
      <p>Today men and nations are being tested by the plummet in the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All are by their
          own choice deciding their destiny, and God is overruling all for the accomplishment of His purposes.</p>
      <p>Christians should be preparing for what is soon to break upon the world as an overwhelming surprise, and this
          preparation they should make by diligently studying the word of God and striving to conform their lives to its
          precepts.</p>
