      <p><strong>Beware ... of evil workers.... For we are the circumcision, which worship</strong></p>
      <p>God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no conﬁdence in the ﬂesh. Philippians 3:2, 3.</p>
      <p>There are those who need in their hearts the touch of the divine Spirit. Then the message for this time will be
          their burden. They will not search for human tests, for something new and strange. The Sabbath of the fourth
          commandment is the test for this time.</p>
      <p>The commandment of God that has been almost universally made void, is the testing truth for this time.... The
          time is coming when all those who worship God</p>
      <p>will be distinguished by this sign. They will be known as the servants of God, by this mark of their allegiance
          to Heaven. But all <nobr>man-made</nobr> tests will divert the mind from the great and important doctrines
          that constitute the present truth.</p>
      <p>It is the desire and plan of Satan to bring in among us those who will go to great <nobr>extremes—people</nobr>
          of narrow minds, who are critical and sharp, and very tenacious in holding their own conceptions of what the
          truth means. They will be exacting, and will seek to enforce rigorous duties, and go to great lengths in
          matters of minor importance, while they neglect the weightier matters of the <nobr>law—judgment</nobr> and
          mercy and the love of God. Through the work of a few of this class of persons, the whole body of
          Sabbathkeepers will be designated as bigoted ... and fanatical....</p>
      <p>God has a special work for the men of experience to do. They are to guard the cause of God. They are to see
          that the work of God is not committed to men who feel it their privilege to move out on their own independent
          judgment, to preach whatever they please, and to be responsible to no one for their instructions or work. Let
          this spirit of <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> once rule in our midst, and there will be no harmony of action, no
          unity of spirit, no safety for the work, and no healthful growth in the cause....Christ prayed that His
          followers might be one as He and the Father were</p>
      <p>one. Those who desire to see this prayer answered, should seek to discourage the slightest tendency to
          division, and try to keep the spirit of unity and love among brethren.</p>
