    <h1>Chap. 98—Sound an Alarm!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the
          land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand. Joel 2:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The things that concern our eternal welfare are now to absorb our attention. We cannot afford to give heavenly
          things the second place.... The judgments of God are</p>
      <p>in the land. They speak in solemn warning, saying, “Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the
          Son of man cometh.”</p>
      <p>There are many, many in our churches who know little of the real meaning of the truth for this time. I appeal
          to them not to disregard the fulﬁlling of the signs of the times, which say so plainly that the end is near. O
          how many who have not sought their soul’s salvation will soon make the bitter lamentation, “The harvest is
          past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved”!</p>
      <p>We are living in the closing scenes of this earth’s history. Prophecy is rapidly fulﬁlling. The hours of
          probation are fast passing. We have no <nobr>time—not</nobr> a <nobr>moment—to</nobr> lose. Let us not be
          found sleeping on guard. Let no one say in his heart or by his works, “My lord delayeth his coming.” Let the
          message of Christ’s soon return sound forth in earnest words of warning. Let us persuade men and women
          everywhere to repent, and ﬂee from the wrath to come. Let us arouse them to immediate preparation; for we
          little know what is before us. Let ministers and lay members go forth into the ripening ﬁelds....</p>
      <p>The Lord is soon to come, and we must be prepared to meet Him in peace. Let us be determined to do all in our
          power to impart light to those around us. We are not to be sad, but cheerful, and we are to keep the Lord
          Jesus ever before us.... We</p>
      <p>must be ready and waiting for His appearing. O how glorious it will be to see Him, and be welcomed as His
          redeemed ones! Long have we waited, but our faith is not to become weak. If we can but see the King in His
          beauty, we shall be forever and forever blessed. I feel as if I must cry aloud, “Homeward bound.” We are
          nearing the time when Christ will come with power and great glory, to take His ransomed ones to their eternal
          home.</p>
