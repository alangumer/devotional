    <h1>Chap. 69—The Highest Kind of Meditation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.
          1 John 3:1.</strong></p>
      <p>What love, what matchless love, that, sinners and aliens as we are, we may be brought back to God and adopted
          into His family! We may address Him by the endearing name, “Our Father.” ...</p>
      <p>All the paternal love which has come down from generation to generation through the channel of human hearts,
          all the springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill to the boundless
          ocean when compared with the inﬁnite, exhaustless love of God. Tongue cannot utter it; pen cannot portray it.
          You may meditate upon it every day of your life; you may search the Scriptures diligently in order to
          understand it; you may summon every power and capability that God has given you, in the endeavor to comprehend
          the love and compassion of the heavenly Father; and yet there is an inﬁnity beyond. You may study that love
          for ages; yet you can never fully comprehend the length and the breadth, the depth and the height, of the love
          of God in giving His Son to die for the world. Eternity itself can never fully reveal it. Yet as we study the
          Bible and meditate upon the life of Christ and the plan of redemption, these great themes will open to our
          understanding more and more.</p>
      <p>Christ came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, full of mercy, tenderness, and compassion.</p>
      <p>It would be well to spend a thoughtful hour each day reviewing the life of Christ from the manger to Calvary.
          We should take it point by point and let the imagination vividly grasp each scene, especially the closing ones
          of His earthly life. By thus contemplating His teachings and sufferings, and the inﬁnite sacriﬁce made by Him
          for the redemption of the race, we may strengthen our faith, quicken our love, and become more deeply imbued
          with the spirit which sustained our Saviour. If we would be saved at last we must all learn the lesson of
          penitence and faith at the foot of the cross.... Everything noble and generous in man will respond to the</p>
      <p>contemplation of Christ upon the cross.</p>
