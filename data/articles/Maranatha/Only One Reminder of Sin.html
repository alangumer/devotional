    <h1>Chap. 340—Only One Reminder of Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner. Proverbs
          11:31.</strong></p>
      <p>The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. Proverbs 11:31. They “shall be stubble: and the day that
          cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.” Malachi 4:1. Some are destroyed as in a moment, while
          others suffer many days. All are punished “according to their deeds.” The sins of the righteous having been
          transferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only for his own rebellion, but for all the sins which he has
          caused God’s people to commit. His punishment is to be far greater than that of those whom he has deceived.
          After all have perished who fell by his deceptions, he is still to live and suffer on. In the cleansing ﬂames
          the wicked are at last destroyed, root and <nobr>branch—Satan</nobr> the root, his followers the
          branches.</p>
      <p>Satan and all who have joined him in rebellion will be cut off.... Then “the</p>
      <p>wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be”; “they shall be as
          though they had not been.” Psalm 37:10; Obadiah 16.</p>
      <p>The justice of God is satisﬁed, and the saints and all the angelic host say with a loud voice, Amen.</p>
      <p>While the earth is wrapped in the ﬁre of God’s vengeance, the righteous abide safely in the Holy City. Upon
          those that had part in the ﬁrst resurrection, the second death has no power. (Revelation 20:6.) While God is
          to the wicked a consuming ﬁre, He is to His people both a sun and a shield. (Psalm 84:11.)</p>
      <p>The ﬁre that consumes the wicked puriﬁes the earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally
          burning hell will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.</p>
      <p>One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of His cruciﬁxion....</p>
      <p>All that was lost by sin has been restored.... God’s original purpose in the</p>
      <p>creation of the earth is fulﬁlled as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. “The righteous shall inherit
          the land, and dwell therein for ever.” Psalm 37:29.</p>
