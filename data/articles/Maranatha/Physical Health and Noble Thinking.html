      <p><strong>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from ﬂeshly lusts, which war against
          the soul. 1 Peter 2:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Many regard this text as a warning against licentiousness only; but it has a broader meaning. It forbids every
          injurious gratiﬁcation of appetite or passion. Every perverted appetite becomes a warring lust. Appetite was
          given us for a good purpose, not to become the minister of death by being perverted, and thus degenerating
          into “lusts, which war against the soul.” Peter’s admonition is a most direct and forcible warning against the
          use of all stimulants and narcotics. These indulgences may well be classed among the lusts that exert a
          pernicious inﬂuence upon moral character.</p>
      <p>Let none who profess godliness regard with indifference the health of the body, and ﬂatter themselves that
          intemperance is no sin and will not affect their spirituality. A close sympathy exists between the physical
          and the moral nature. The standard of virtue is elevated or degraded by the physical habits. Excessive eating
          of the best of food will produce a morbid condition of the moral feelings. And if the food is not the most
          healthful, the effects will be still more injurious. Any habit which does not promote healthful action in the
          human system degrades the higher and nobler faculties....Indulgence of appetite strengthens the animal
          propensities, giving them</p>
      <p>the ascendancy over the mental and spiritual powers.</p>
      <p>The strength of the temptation to indulge appetite can be measured only by the inexpressible anguish of our
          Redeemer in that long fast in the wilderness. He knew that the indulgence of perverted appetite would so
          deaden man’s perceptions that sacred things could not be discerned.... If the power of indulged appetite was
          so</p>
      <p>strong upon the race, that, in order to break its hold, the divine Son of God, in man’s behalf, had to endure a
          fast of nearly six weeks, what a work is before the Christian! Yet, however great the struggle, he may
          overcome. By the help of that divine power which withstood the ﬁercest temptations that Satan could invent,
          he, too, may be entirely successful in his warfare with evil, and at last may wear the victor’s crown in the
          kingdom of God.</p>
