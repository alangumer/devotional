    <h1>Chap. 343—The New Heavens and the New Earth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting
          unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on ﬁre shall be dissolved, and the elements shall
          melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,
          wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 Peter <nobr>3:11-13.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The feet of the wicked will never desecrate the earth made new. Fire will come down from God out of heaven and
          devour <nobr>them—burn</nobr> them up root and branch. Satan is the root, and his children are the
          branches.</p>
      <p>The same ﬁre from God that consumed the wicked puriﬁed the whole earth. The broken, ragged mountains melted
          with fervent heat, the atmosphere also, and all the stubble was consumed. Then our inheritance opened before
          us, glorious and beautiful, and we inherited the whole earth made new.</p>
      <p>“I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the ﬁrst heaven and the ﬁrst earth were passed away.” Revelation 21:1.
          The ﬁre that consumes the wicked puriﬁes the earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally
          burning hell will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.</p>
      <p>The sea divides friends. It is a barrier between us and those whom we love. Our associations are broken up by
          the broad, fathomless ocean. In the new earth there will be no more sea, and there shall pass there “no galley
          with oars.” In the past many who have loved and served God have been bound by chains to their seats in
          galleys, compelled to serve the purpose of cruel, hardhearted men. The Lord has looked upon their suffering in
          sympathy and compassion. Thank God, in the earth made new there will be no ﬁerce torrents, no engulﬁng ocean,
          no restless, murmuring waves.</p>
      <p>Let all that is beautiful in our earthly home remind us of the crystal river and green ﬁelds, the waving trees
          and the living fountains, the shining city and the <nobr>white-robed</nobr> singers, of our heavenly
          <nobr>home—that</nobr> world of beauty which no artist can picture, no mortal tongue describe. “Eye hath not
          seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
          that love him.”</p>
