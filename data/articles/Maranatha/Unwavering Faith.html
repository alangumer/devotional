    <h1>Chap. 79—Unwavering Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the
          wind and tossed. James 1:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Prayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied together. In the prayer of faith there is a
          divine science; it is a science that everyone who would make his <nobr>life-work</nobr> a success must
          understand. Christ says, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye
          shall have them.” Mark 11:24. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God’s will; we must ask
          for the things that He has promised, and whatever we receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions
          met, the promise is unequivocal.</p>
      <p>For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for wisdom and strength to do His work,
          for any gift He has promised, we may ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and return thanks to God
          that we have received. We need look for no outward evidence of the blessing. The gift is in the promise, and
          we may go about our work assured that what God has promised He is able to perform, and that the gift, which we
          already possess, will be realized when we need it most.</p>
      <p>To live thus by the word of God means the surrender to Him of the whole life. There will be felt a continual
          sense of need and dependence, a drawing out of the heart after God. Prayer is a necessity; for it is the life
          of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer, have their place; but it is secret communion with God that sustains
          the soul life....</p>
      <p>An intensity such as never before was seen is taking possession of the world. In amusement, in
          <nobr>money-making,</nobr> in the contest for power, in the very struggle for existence, there is a terrible
          force that engrosses body and mind and soul. In the midst of this maddening rush, God is speaking. He bids us
          come apart and commune with Him. “Be still, and know that I am God.” ...</p>
      <p>Not a pause for a moment in His presence, but personal contact with Christ, to sit down in companionship with
          <nobr>Him—this</nobr> is our need.</p>
