    <h1>Chap. 348—At Home in the New Jerusalem</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
          and her people a joy. Isaiah 65:18.</strong></p>
      <p>There is the New Jerusalem, the metropolis of the gloriﬁed new earth, “a crown of glory in the hand of the
          Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.” “Her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a
          jasper stone, clear as crystal.” “The nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the
          kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.” Saith the Lord: “I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and
          joy in my people.” ...</p>
      <p>In the City of God “there shall be no night.” None will need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in
          doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning and
          shall ever be far from its close. “And they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth
          them light.” The light of the sun will be superseded by a radiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet which
          immeasurably surpasses the brightness of our noontide. The glory of God and the Lamb ﬂoods the Holy City with
          unfading light. The redeemed walk in the sunless glory of perpetual day.</p>
      <p>“I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.” The people of God are
          privileged to hold open communion with the Father and the Son. “Now we see through a glass, darkly.” We behold
          the image of God reﬂected, as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His dealings with men; but then we
          shall see Him face to face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His presence and behold the
          glory of His countenance.</p>
      <p>There we shall know even as also we are known. There the loves and sympathies that God has planted in the soul
          will ﬁnd truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings, the harmonious social life with
          the blessed angels and with the faithful ones of all ages, the sacred fellowship that binds together “the
          whole family in heaven and <nobr>earth”—all</nobr> are among the experiences of the hereafter.</p>
