    <h1>Chap. 52—Temptations in Disguise</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the ﬂock.
          Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Acts
          20:29, 30.</strong></p>
      <p>God has not passed His people by and chosen one solitary man here and another there as the only ones worthy to
          be entrusted with His truth. He does not give one man new light contrary to the established faith of the body.
          In every reform men have arisen making this claim....</p>
      <p>One accepts some new and original idea which does not seem to conﬂict with the truth. He ... dwells upon it
          until it seems to him to be clothed with beauty and importance, for Satan has power to give this false
          appearance. At last it becomes the <nobr>all-absorbing</nobr> theme, the one great point around which
          everything centers; and the truth is uprooted from the heart....</p>
      <p>I warn you to beware of these side issues, whose tendency is to divert the mind from the truth. Error is never
          harmless. It never sanctiﬁes, but always brings confusion and dissension....</p>
      <p>There are a thousand temptations in disguise prepared for those who have the light of truth; and the only
          safety for any of us is in receiving no new doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures, without ﬁrst
          submitting it to brethren of experience. Lay it before them in a humble, teachable spirit, with earnest
          prayer; and if they see no light in it, yield to their judgment....</p>
      <p>Satan is constantly at work; but few have any idea of his activity and subtlety. The people of God must be
          prepared to withstand the wily foe. It is this resistance that Satan dreads. He knows better than we do the
          limit of his power and how easily he can be overcome if we resist and face him. Through divine strength the
          weakest saint is more than a match for him and all his angels, and if brought to the test he would be able to
          prove his superior power. Therefore Satan’s step is noiseless, his movements stealthy, and his batteries
          masked. He does not venture to show himself openly, lest he arouse the Christian’s dormant energies and send
          him to God in prayer.</p>
