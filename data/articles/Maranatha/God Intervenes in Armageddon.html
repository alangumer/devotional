    <h1>Chap. 288—God Intervenes in Armageddon</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he
          will plead with all ﬂesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Jeremiah
          25:31.</strong></p>
      <p>For six thousand years the great controversy has been in progress; the Son of God and His heavenly messengers
          have been in conﬂict with the power of the evil one, to warn, enlighten, and save the children of men. Now all
          have made their decisions; the wicked have fully united with Satan in his warfare against God. The time has
          come for God to vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. Now the controversy is not alone with Satan,
          but with men. “The Lord hath a controversy with the nations”; “He will give them that are wicked to the
          sword.”</p>
      <p>The mark of deliverance has been set upon those “that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done.”
          Now the angel of death goes forth, represented in Ezekiel’s vision by the men with the slaughtering weapons,
          to whom the command is given: “Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but
          come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.” Says the prophet: “They began at the
          ancient men which were before the house.” Ezekiel <nobr>9:1-6.</nobr> The work of destruction begins among
          those who have professed to be the spiritual guardians of the people. The false watchmen are the ﬁrst to fall.
          There are none to pity or to spare. Men, women, maidens, and little children perish together.</p>
      <p>“The Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
          shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.” Isaiah 26:21.... In the mad strife of their own
          ﬁerce passions, and by</p>
      <p>the awful outpouring of God’s unmingled wrath, fall the wicked inhabitants of the <nobr>earth—priests,</nobr>
          rulers, and people, rich and poor, high and low. “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end
          of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried.”
          Jeremiah 25:33.</p>
