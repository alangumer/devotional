    <h1>Chap. 124—Wresting the Scriptures</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They that are unlearned and unstable wrest... the ... scriptures, unto their own destruction. 2 Peter
          3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The position that it is of no consequence what men believe is one of Satan’s most successful deceptions. He
          knows that the truth, received in the love of it, sanctiﬁes the soul of the receiver; therefore he is
          constantly seeking to substitute false theories, fables, another gospel....</p>
      <p>The vague and fanciful interpretations of Scripture, and the many conﬂicting theories concerning religious
          faith, that are found in the Christian world are the work of our great adversary to confuse minds so that they
          shall not discern the truth. And the discord and division which exist among the churches of Christendom are in
          a great measure due to the prevailing custom of wresting the Scriptures to support a favorite theory. Instead
          of carefully studying God’s word with humility of heart to obtain a knowledge of His will, many seek only to
          discover something odd or original.</p>
      <p>In order to sustain erroneous doctrines or unchristian practices, some will seize upon passages of Scripture
          separated from the context, perhaps quoting half of a single verse as proving their point, when the remaining
          portion would show the meaning to be quite the opposite. With the cunning of the serpent they entrench
          themselves behind disconnected utterances construed to suit their carnal desires. Thus do many willfully
          pervert the word of God. Others, who have an active imagination, seize upon the ﬁgures and symbols of Holy
          Writ, interpret them to suit their fancy, with little regard to the testimony of Scripture as its own
          interpreter, and then they present their vagaries as the teachings of the Bible.</p>
      <p>Whenever the study of the Scriptures is entered upon without a prayerful, humble, teachable spirit, the
          plainest and simplest as well as the most difﬁcult passages will be wrested from their true meaning.... The
          Word of God is plain to all</p>
      <p>who study it with a prayerful heart. Every truly honest soul will come to the light of truth. “Light is sown
          for the righteous.” Psalm 97:11. And no church can advance in holiness unless its members are earnestly
          seeking for truth as for hid treasure.</p>
