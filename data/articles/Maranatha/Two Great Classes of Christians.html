    <h1>Chap. 180—Two Great Classes of Christians</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world
          wondered after the beast. Revelation 13:3.</strong></p>
      <p>In homage to the Papacy the United States will not be alone. The inﬂuence of Rome in the countries that once
          acknowledged her dominion, is still far from being destroyed.</p>
      <p>In the last conﬂict the Sabbath will be the special point of controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular
          rulers and religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of the Sunday; and as milder measures fail,
          the most oppressive laws will be enacted. It will be urged that the few who stand in opposition to an
          institution of the church and a law of the land ought not to be tolerated....</p>
      <p>Romanism in the Old World, and apostate Protestantism in the New, will pursue a similar course toward those who
          honor the divine precepts.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>so-called</nobr> Christian world is to be the theater of great and decisive actions. Men in authority
          will enact laws controlling the conscience, after the example of the Papacy. Babylon will make all nations
          drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. Every nation will be involved. [Revelation
          <nobr>18:3-7</nobr> quoted.]</p>
      <p>The warning of the third angel [of Revelation 14] ... is represented in the prophecy as being proclaimed with a
          loud voice, by an angel ﬂying in the midst of heaven; and it will command the attention of the world.</p>
      <p>In the issue of the contest all Christendom will be divided into two great <nobr>classes—those</nobr> who keep
          the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image and receive his
          mark. Although church and state will unite their power to compel “all, both small and great, rich and poor,
          free and bond” (Revelation 13:16), to receive “the mark of the beast,” yet the people of God will not receive
          it. The prophet of Patmos beholds “them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and
          over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God” and
          singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Revelation 15:2, 3.</p>
