      <p><strong>That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones,
          polished after the similitude of a palace. Psalm 144:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Our work for Christ is to begin with the family in the home.... There is no</p>
      <p>missionary ﬁeld more important than this.</p>
      <p>Happy are the parents whose lives are a true reﬂection of the divine, so that the promises and commands of God
          awaken in the child gratitude and reverence; the parents whose tenderness and justice and
          <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> interpret to the child the love and justice and <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> of
          God; and who, by teaching the child to love and trust and obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and
          obey his Father in heaven. Parents who impart to a child such a gift have endowed him with a treasure more
          precious than the wealth of all the <nobr>ages—a</nobr> treasure as enduring as eternity.</p>
      <p>God wants every child of tender age to be His child, to be adopted into His family. Young though they may be,
          the youth may be members of the household of faith and have a most precious experience. They may have hearts
          that are tender and ready to receive impressions that will be lasting. They may have their hearts drawn out in
          conﬁdence and love for Jesus, and live for the Saviour. Christ will make them little missionaries. The whole
          current of their thought may be changed, so that sin will not appear a thing to be enjoyed, but to be shunned
          and hated.</p>
      <p>By precept and example parents are to teach their children to labor for the unconverted. The children should be
          so educated that they will sympathize with the aged and afﬂicted and will seek to alleviate the sufferings of
          the poor and distressed.... From their earliest years <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and sacriﬁce for the good
          of</p>
      <p>others and the advancement of Christ’s cause should be inculcated, that they may be laborers together with
          God....</p>
      <p>God designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol of the family in heaven. Christian homes, established
          and conducted in accordance with God’s plan, are among His most effective agencies for the formation of
          Christian character and for the advancement of His work.</p>
