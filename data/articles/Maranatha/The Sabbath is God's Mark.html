    <h1>Chap. 238—The Sabbath is God’s Mark</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord
          your God. Ezekiel 20:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood, to show that they were God’s property. So the
          children of God in this age will bear the signature God has appointed. They will place themselves in harmony
          with God’s holy law. A mark is placed upon every one of God’s people just as verily as a mark was placed over
          the doors of the Hebrew dwellings, to preserve the people from the general ruin. God declares, “I gave them my
          sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”</p>
      <p>Every soul in our world is the Lord’s property, by creation and by redemption. Each individual soul is on trial
          for his life. Has he given to God that which belongs to Him? Has he surrendered to God all that is His as His
          purchased possession? All who cherish the Lord as their portion in this life will be under His control, and
          will receive the sign, the mark of God, which shows them to be God’s special possession. Christ’s
          righteousness will go before them, and the glory of the Lord will be their rereward. The Lord protects every
          human being who bears His sign.</p>
      <p>“And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths
          ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
          Lord that doth sanctify you.... Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest,</p>
      <p>holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the
          children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
          perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made
          heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
      <p>This recognition of God is of the highest value to every human being. All who love and serve Him are very
          precious in His sight. He would have them stand where they are worthy representatives of the truth as it is in
          Jesus.</p>
