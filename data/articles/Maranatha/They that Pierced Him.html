    <h1>Chap. 285—They that Pierced Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
          Mark 14:62.</strong></p>
      <p>As they [the Jewish rulers] gaze upon His glory, there ﬂashes before their minds the memory of the Son of Man
          clad in the garb of humanity. They remember how they treated Him, how they refused Him, and pressed close to
          the side of the great apostate. The scenes of Christ’s life appear before them in all their clearness. All He
          did, all He said, the humiliation to which He descended to save them from the taint of sin, rises before them
          in condemnation.</p>
      <p>They behold Him riding into Jerusalem, and see Him break into an agony of tears over the impenitent city that
          would not receive His message. His voice, which was heard in invitation, in entreaty, in tones of tender
          solicitude, seems again to fall upon their ears. The scene in the garden of Gethsemane rises before them, and
          they hear Christ’s amazing prayer, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.”</p>
      <p>Again they hear the voice of Pilate, saying, “I ﬁnd in him no fault at all.” They see the shameful scene in the
          judgment hall, when Barabbas stood by the side of Christ, and they had the privilege of choosing the guiltless
          One. They hear again the words of Pilate, “Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is
          called Christ?” They hear the response, “Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas.” To the question of
          Pilate, “What shall I do then with Jesus?” the answer comes, “Let him be cruciﬁed.”</p>
      <p>Again they see their Sacriﬁce bearing the reproach of the cross. They hear the loud, triumphant tones
          tauntingly exclaim, “If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.” “He saved others; himself he cannot
          save.”</p>
      <p>Now they behold Him not in the garden of Gethsemane, not in the judgment hall, not on the cross of Calvary. The
          signs of His humiliation have passed away, and they look upon the face of <nobr>God—the</nobr> face they spit
          upon, the face which priests and rulers struck with the palms of their hands. Now the truth in all its
          vividness is revealed to them.</p>
