    <h1>Chap. 341—We Belong to the Royal Family</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
          when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Can any earthly promotion confer honor equal to <nobr>this—to</nobr> be sons of God, children of the heavenly
          King, members of the royal family? ... The nobility of earth are but men; they die, and return to dust; and
          there is no lasting satisfaction in their praise and honor. But the honor that comes from God is lasting. To
          be heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, is to be entitled to unsearchable <nobr>riches—treasures</nobr>
          of such value that in comparison with them the gold and silver, the gems and precious stones of earth, sink
          into insigniﬁcance.</p>
      <p>To have fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is to be ennobled and elevated, and made a partaker
          of joys unspeakable and full of glory. Food, clothing, station, and wealth may have their value; but to have a
          connection with God and to be a partaker of His divine nature is of priceless value. Our lives should be hid
          with Christ in God; and although it “doth not yet appear what we shall be,” “when Christ, who is our life,
          shall appear,” “we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” The princely dignity of the Christian
          character will shine forth as the sun, and the beams of light from the face of Christ will be reﬂected upon
          those who have puriﬁed themselves even as He is pure. The privilege of becoming sons of God is cheaply
          purchased, even at the sacriﬁce of everything we possess, be it life itself.</p>
      <p>When John in his mortal state beheld the glory of God, he fell as one dead; he was not able to endure the
          sight. But when the children of God shall have put on immortality, they will “see him as he is.” They will
          stand before the throne, accepted in the Beloved. All their sins have been blotted out, all their
          transgressions borne away. Now they can look upon the undimmed glory of the throne of God. They have been
          partakers with Christ in His sufferings, they have been workers together with Him in the plan of redemption,
          and they are partakers with Him in the joy of seeing souls saved in the kingdom of God, there to praise God
          through all eternity.</p>
