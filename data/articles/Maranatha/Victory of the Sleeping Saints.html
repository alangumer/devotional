    <h1>Chap. 292—Victory of the Sleeping Saints</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his
          voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
          evil, unto the resurrection of damnation John 5:28, 29.</strong></p>
      <p>The <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> will call up His purchased possession in the ﬁrst resurrection, and until that
          triumphant hour, when the last trump shall sound and the vast army shall come forth to eternal victory, every
          sleeping saint will be kept in safety and will be guarded as a precious jewel, who is known to God by name. By
          the power of the Saviour that dwelt in them while living and because they were partakers of the divine nature,
          they are brought forth from the dead.</p>
      <p>“The hour is coming,” Christ said, “in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall
          come forth.” That voice is to resound through all the habitations of the dead; and every saint who sleeps in
          Jesus will awake and leave his prisonhouse. Then the virtue of character we have received from Christ’s
          righteousness will ally us to true greatness of the highest order.</p>
      <p>The victory of the sleeping saints will be glorious on the morning of the resurrection.... The
          <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> will crown with immortality all who come forth from</p>
      <p>the grave.</p>
      <p>There stands the risen host. The last thought was of death and its pangs. The last thoughts they had were of
          the grave and the tomb, but now they proclaim, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”
          ... Here they stand and the ﬁnishing touch of immortality is put upon them and they go up to meet their Lord
          in the air.... There are the columns of angels on either side; ... then the angelic choir</p>
      <p>strike the note of victory and the angels in the two columns take up the song and the redeemed host join as
          though they had been singing the song on the earth, and they have been. Oh, what music! There is not an
          inharmonious note. Every voice proclaims, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.” He sees the travail of His
          soul, and is satisﬁed.</p>
