    <h1>Chap. 9—Humble Men Proclaim the Message</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
          shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. 2 Peter
          1:19.</strong></p>
      <p>This message [Revelation 14:6, 7] is declared to be a part of “the everlasting gospel.” The work of preaching
          the gospel has not been committed to angels, but has been entrusted to men. Holy angels have been employed in
          directing this work, they have in charge the great movements for the salvation of men; but the actual
          proclamation of the gospel is performed by the servants of Christ upon the earth.</p>
      <p>Faithful men, who were obedient to the promptings of God’s Spirit and the teachings of His word, were to
          proclaim this warning to the world. They were those who had taken heed to the “sure word of prophecy,” the
          “light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise.” 2 Peter 1:19. They had been
          seeking the knowledge of God more than all hid treasures, counting it “better than the merchandise of silver,
          and the gain thereof than ﬁne gold.” Proverbs 3:14. And the Lord revealed to them the great things of the
          kingdom. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.” Psalm
          25:14.</p>
      <p>It was not the scholarly theologians who had an understanding of this truth, and engaged in its proclamation.
          Had these been faithful watchmen, diligently and prayerfully searching the Scriptures, they would have known
          the time of night; the prophecies would have opened to them the events about to take place. But they did not
          occupy this position, and the message was given by humbler men. Said Jesus: “Walk while ye have the light,
          lest darkness come upon you.” John 12:35. Those who turn away from the light which God has given, or who
          neglect to seek it when it is within their reach, are left in darkness. But the Saviour declares: “He that
          followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” John 8:12. Whoever is with
          singleness of purpose seeking to do God’s will, earnestly heeding the light already given, will receive
          greater light; to that soul some star of heavenly radiance will be sent to guide him into all truth.</p>
