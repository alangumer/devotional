    <h1>Chap. 173—Food and Lands in the Last Days</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.
          Sufﬁcient unto the day is evil thereof. Matthew 6:34.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has shown me in vision, repeatedly, that it is contrary to the Bible to make any provision for our
          temporal wants in the time of trouble. I saw that if the saints have food laid up by them, or in the ﬁelds, in
          the time of trouble when sword, famine, and pestilence are in the land, it will be taken from them by violent
          hands, and strangers would reap their ﬁelds. Then will be the time for us to trust wholly in God, and He will
          sustain us. I saw that our bread and water would be sure at that time, and we should not lack, or suffer
          hunger. The Lord has shown me that some of His children would fear when they see the price of food rising, and
          they would buy food and lay it by for the time of trouble. Then in a time of need, I saw them go to their food
          and look at it, and it had bred worms, and was full of living creatures, and not ﬁt for use.</p>
      <p>Houses and lands will be of no use to the saints in the time of trouble, for they will then have to ﬂee before
          infuriated mobs, and at that time their possessions cannot be disposed of to advance the cause of present
          truth....</p>
      <p>I saw that if any held on to their property and did not inquire of the Lord as to their duty, He would not make
          duty known, and they would be permitted to keep their property, and in the time of trouble it would come up
          before them like a mountain to crush them, and they would try to dispose of it, but would not be able....</p>
      <p>But if they desired to be taught, He would teach them, in a time of need, when to sell and how much to
          sell.</p>
      <p>In the last great conﬂict of the controversy with Satan those who are loyal to God will see every earthly
          support cut off. Because they refuse to break His law in obedience to earthly powers, they will be forbidden
          to buy or sell. It will ﬁnally be decreed that they shall be put to death.... But to the obedient is given the
          promise,</p>
      <p>“He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his
          waters shall be sure.” Isaiah 33:16. By this promise the children of God will live.</p>
