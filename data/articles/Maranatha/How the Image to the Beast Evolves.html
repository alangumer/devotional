    <h1>Chap. 161—How the Image to the Beast Evolves</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He exerciseth all the power of the ﬁrst beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell
          therein to worship the ﬁrst beast, whose deadly wound was healed. Revelation 13:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In order for the United States to form an image of the beast, the religious power must so control the civil
          government that the authority of the state will also be employed by the church to accomplish her own
          ends....</p>
      <p>The “image to the beast” represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the
          Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas....</p>
      <p>When Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation
          of the true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of God, to obey a precept which has no higher
          authority than that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is paying homage to Rome and to the power
          which enforces the institution ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As men then reject
          the institution which God has declared to be the sign of His authority, and honor in its stead that which Rome
          has chosen as the token of her supremacy, they will thereby accept the sign of allegiance to
          <nobr>Rome—“the</nobr> mark of the beast.” And it is not until the issue is thus plainly set before the
          people, and they are brought to choose between the commandments of God and the commandments of men, that those
          who continue in transgression will receive “the mark of the beast.”...</p>
      <p>In the issue of the contest all Christendom will be divided into two great <nobr>classes—those</nobr> who keep
          the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image and receive his
          mark. Although church and state will unite their power to compel “all, both small and great, rich and poor,
          free and bond” (Revelation 13:16), to receive “the mark of the beast,” yet the people of God will not receive
          it. The prophet of Patmos beholds “them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and
          over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God” and
          singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Revelation 15:2, 3.</p>
