    <h1>Chap. 42—Searching Questions</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean
          hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. Psalm 24:3,
          4.</strong></p>
      <p>A soul united with Christ ... will war against all transgression and every approach of sin. He becomes every
          day more like a bright and shining light, and more victorious. He goes on from strength to strength, not from
          weakness to weakness.</p>
      <p>Let no one deceive his own soul in this matter. If you harbor pride, <nobr>self-esteem,</nobr> a love for the
          supremacy, vainglory, unholy ambition, murmuring, discontent, bitterness, <nobr>evil-speaking,</nobr> lying,
          deception, slandering, you have not Christ abiding in your heart.... You must have a Christian character that
          will stand....</p>
      <p>There must be thorough conversions among those who claim to believe the truth, or they will fall in the day of
          trial. God’s people must reach a high standard. They must be a holy nation, a peculiar people, a chosen
          <nobr>generation—zealous</nobr> of good works. Christ has not died for you that you may possess the passions,
          tastes, and habits of men of the world....</p>
      <p>No man enters the portals of glory but he who sets his heart thitherward. Then let the questions come home, Do
          you mind earthly things? Are your thoughts pure? Are you breathing the atmosphere of heaven? Do you carry with
          you the miasma of pollution? ... Are you earnest and devoted, serving God with purity and in the beauty of
          holiness? Ask sincerely, Am I a child of God, or am I not? ...</p>
      <p>We need a thorough reformation in all our churches. The converting power of God must come into the church....
          Put not off the day of preparation. Slumber not in</p>
      <p>a state of unpreparedness, having no oil in your vessels with your lamps.... Let not</p>
      <p>the question remain in perilous uncertainty. Ask yourselves earnestly, Am I among the saved, or the unsaved?
          Shall I stand, or shall I not stand? He only that hath clean hands and a pure heart shall stand in that
          day.</p>
      <p>It is the privilege of every son of God to be a true Christian moment by moment; then he has all heaven
          enlisted on his side.</p>
