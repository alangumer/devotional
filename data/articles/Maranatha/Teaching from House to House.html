    <h1>Chap. 96—Teaching from House to House</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I kept back nothing that was proﬁtable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly,
          and from house to house. Acts 20:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Among the members of our churches there should be more <nobr>house-to-house</nobr> labor in giving Bible
          readings and distributing literature.... As we sow beside all waters</p>
      <p>we shall realize that “he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.” Christ’s example must be
          followed by those who claim to be His children.</p>
      <p>Relieve the physical necessities of your fellow men, and their gratitude will break down the barriers and
          enable you to reach their hearts.... Women as well as men can</p>
      <p>engage in the work.... They can do in families a work that men cannot do, a work</p>
      <p>that reaches the inner life. They can come close to the hearts of those whom men cannot reach. Their work is
          needed. Discreet and humble women can do a good work in explaining the truth to the people in their homes. The
          word of God thus explained will do its leavening work, and ... whole families will be converted....</p>
      <p>In the home circle, at your neighbor’s ﬁreside, at the bedside of the sick, in a quiet way you may read the
          Scriptures and speak a word for Jesus and the truth. Precious seed may thus be sown that will spring up and
          bring forth fruit....</p>
      <p>There is missionary work to be done in many unpromising places. The missionary spirit needs to take hold of our
          souls, inspiring us to reach classes for whom we had not planned to labor and in ways and places that we had
          no idea of working. The Lord has His plan for the sowing of the gospel seed. In sowing according to His will,
          we shall so multiply the seed that His word may reach thousands who have never heard the truth.</p>
      <p>Thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand angels are waiting to <nobr>co-operate</nobr>
          with members of our churches in communicating the light that God has generously given, that a people may be
          prepared for the coming of Christ.</p>
      <p>Our sisters, the youth, the <nobr>middle-aged,</nobr> and those of advanced years, may act a part in the
          closing work for this time; and in doing this as they have opportunity, they will obtain an experience of the
          highest value to themselves. In forgetfulness of self, they will grow in grace.</p>
