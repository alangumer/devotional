    <h1>Chap. 358—Inexhaustible Themes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that
          should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
          signify, when it testiﬁed beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.... Which
          things</strong></p>
      <p>the angels desire to look into. 1 Peter <nobr>1:10-12.</nobr></p>
      <p>In this life we can only begin to understand the wonderful theme of redemption. With our ﬁnite comprehension we
          may consider most earnestly the shame and the glory, the life and the death, the justice and the mercy, that
          meet in the cross; yet with the utmost stretch of our mental powers we fail to grasp its full signiﬁcance. The
          length and the breadth, the depth and the height, of redeeming love are but dimly comprehended. The plan of
          redemption will not be fully understood, even when the ransomed see as they are seen and know as they are
          known; but through the eternal ages new truth will continually unfold to the wondering and delighted mind.
          Though the griefs and pains and temptations of earth are ended and the cause removed, the people of God will
          ever have a distinct, intelligent knowledge of what their salvation has cost....</p>
      <p>The mystery of the cross explains all other mysteries. In the light that streams from Calvary the attributes of
          God which had ﬁlled us with fear and awe appear beautiful and attractive. Mercy, tenderness, and parental love
          are seen to blend with holiness, justice, and power. While we behold the majesty of His throne, high and
          lifted up, we see His character in its gracious manifestations, and comprehend, as never before, the
          signiﬁcance of that endearing title, “Our Father.”</p>
      <p>It will be seen that He who is inﬁnite in wisdom could devise no plan for our salvation except the sacriﬁce of
          His son. The compensation for this sacriﬁce is the joy of peopling the earth with ransomed beings, holy,
          happy, and immortal. The result of the Saviour’s conﬂict with the powers of darkness is joy to the redeemed,
          redounding to the glory of God throughout eternity. And such is the value of the soul that the Father is
          satisﬁed with the price paid; and Christ Himself, beholding the fruits of His great sacriﬁce, is
          satisﬁed.</p>
      <p>Through all eternity the ransomed host will be His chief glory.</p>
