    <h1>Chap. 351—Unexpected Recompense</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord. Ephesians
          6:8.</strong></p>
      <p>In this life our work for God often seems to be almost fruitless. Our efforts to do good may be earnest and
          persevering, yet we may not be permitted to witness their results. To us the effort may seem to be lost. But
          the Saviour assures us that our work is noted in heaven, and that the recompense cannot fail.</p>
      <p>The poor widow who cast her two mites into the Lord’s treasury little knew what she was doing. Her example of
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> has acted and reacted upon thousands of hearts in every land and in every age. It
          has brought to the treasury of God gifts from the high and the low, the rich and the poor. It has helped to
          sustain missions, to establish hospitals, to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, and preach the
          gospel to the poor. Multitudes have been blessed through her unselﬁsh deed. And the outworking of all these
          lines of inﬂuence she, in the day of God, will be permitted to see. So with Mary’s precious gift to the
          Saviour. How many have been inspired to loving service by the memory of that broken alabaster box! And how she
          will rejoice as she beholds all this!</p>
      <p>“Verily I say unto you,” Christ declared, “Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole
          world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.” Looking into the future, the
          Saviour spoke with certainty concerning His gospel. It was to be preached throughout the world. And as far as
          the gospel extended, Mary’s gift would shed its fragrance, and hearts would be blessed through her unstudied
          act. Kingdoms would rise and fall; the names of monarchs and conquerors would be forgotten; but this woman’s
          deed would be immortalized upon the pages of sacred history. Until time should be no more, that broken
          alabaster box would tell the story of the abundant love of God for a fallen race.</p>
      <p>Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness and to God is noted in the books of heaven, and in the
          day of God everyone who has given himself as an instrument for the Holy Spirit’s working will be permitted to
          behold what his life has wrought.</p>
