    <h1>Chap. 66—Taste for Yourself</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. Psalm
          34:8.</strong></p>
      <p>How shall we know for ourselves God’s goodness and His love? The psalmist tells <nobr>us—not,</nobr> hear and
          know, read and know, or believe and know; <nobr>but—“Taste</nobr> and see that the Lord is good.” Instead of
          relying upon the word of another, taste for yourself.</p>
      <p>Experience is knowledge derived from experiment. Experimental religion is what is needed now....
          <nobr>Some—yes,</nobr> a large <nobr>number—have</nobr> a theoretical knowledge</p>
      <p>of religious truth, but have never felt the renewing power of divine grace upon their own hearts.... They
          believe in the wrath of God, but put forth no earnest efforts to</p>
      <p>escape it. They believe in heaven, but make no sacriﬁce to obtain it.... They know a</p>
      <p>remedy for sin, but do not use it. They know the right, but have no relish for it. All their knowledge will but
          increase their condemnation. They have never tasted and learned by experience that the Lord is good.</p>
      <p>To become a disciple of Christ is to deny self and follow Jesus through evil as well as good report.... Every
          darling indulgence that hinders our religious life must</p>
      <p>be cut off.... Will we put forth efforts and make sacriﬁces proportionate to the worth</p>
      <p>of the object to be attained?</p>
      <p>Every association we form, however limited, exerts some inﬂuence upon us. The extent to which we yield to that
          inﬂuence will be determined by the degree of intimacy, the constancy of the intercourse, and our love and
          veneration for the one with whom we associate. Thus by acquaintance and association with Christ we may become
          like Him, the one faultless Example.</p>
      <p>Communion with <nobr>Christ—how</nobr> unspeakably precious! Such communion it is our privilege to enjoy if we
          will seek it, if we will make any sacriﬁce to secure it.</p>
      <p>So everyone may be able, through his own experience, to “set his seal to this, that God is true.” John 3:33,
          A.R.V.... He can testify: “I needed help, and I found it</p>
      <p>in Jesus. Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisﬁed.... I believe</p>
      <p>in Jesus because He is to me a divine Saviour. I believe the Bible because I have found it to be the voice of
          God to my soul.”</p>
