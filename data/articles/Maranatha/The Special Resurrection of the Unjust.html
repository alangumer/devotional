    <h1>Chap. 274—The Special Resurrection of the Unjust</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all
          kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. Revelation 1:7.</strong></p>
      <p>“They also which pierced him” (Revelation 1:7), those that mocked and derided Christ’s dying agonies, and the
          most violent opposers of His truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory and to see the honor
          placed upon the loyal and obedient.</p>
      <p>[At His trial], Caiaphas, raising his right hand toward heaven, addressed Jesus in the form of a solemn oath:
          “I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.” ...</p>
      <p>Every ear was bent to listen, and every eye was ﬁxed on His face as He answered, “Thou hast said.” A heavenly
          light seemed to illuminate His pale countenance as He added, “Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye
          see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”</p>
      <p>For a moment the divinity of Christ ﬂashed through His guise of humanity. The high priest quailed before the
          penetrating eyes of the Saviour.... For a moment he</p>
      <p>felt as if standing before the eternal Judge, whose eye, which sees all things, was reading his soul, bringing
          to light mysteries supposed to be hidden with the dead.</p>
      <p>The scene passed from the priest’s vision.... Rending his robe, ... he demanded</p>
      <p>that ... the prisoner be condemned for blasphemy. “What further need have we of witnesses?” he said; “behold,
          now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye?” And they all condemned Him.</p>
      <p>Thus the Jewish leaders made their choice. Their decision was registered in the book which John saw in the hand
          of Him that sat upon the throne, the book which no man could open. In all its vindictiveness this decision
          will appear before them in the day when this book is unsealed by the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</p>
      <p>When Christ comes the second time, not as a prisoner surrounded by a rabble will they see Him. They will see
          Him as heaven’s King.... Then the priests and</p>
      <p>rulers will remember distinctly the scene in the judgment hall. Every circumstance will appear before them as
          if written in letters of ﬁre.</p>
