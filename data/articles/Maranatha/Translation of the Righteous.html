    <h1>Chap. 297—Translation of the Righteous</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
          the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise ﬁrst: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught
          up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 1
          Thessalonians 4:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>Soon appeared the great white cloud. It looked more lovely than ever before. On it sat the Son of man. At ﬁrst
          we did not see Jesus on the cloud, but as it drew near the earth we could behold His lovely person.... The
          voice of the Son of God</p>
      <p>called forth the sleeping saints, clothed with glorious immortality. The living saints were changed in a moment
          and were caught up with them into the cloudy chariot. It looked all over glorious as it rolled upward. On
          either side of the chariot were wings, and beneath it wheels. And as the chariot rolled upward, the wheels
          cried, “Holy,” and the wings, as they moved, cried, “Holy,” and the retinue of holy angels around the cloud
          cried, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!” And the saints in the cloud cried, “Glory! Alleluia!”</p>
      <p>We all entered the cloud together, and were seven days ascending to the sea of glass, when Jesus brought the
          crowns, and with His own right hand placed them on our heads. He gave us harps of gold and palms of victory.
          Here on the sea of glass the 144,000 stood in a perfect square. Some of them had very bright crowns, others
          not so bright. Some crowns appeared heavy with stars, while others had but few. All were perfectly satisﬁed
          with their crowns. And they were all clothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders to their feet.
          Angels were all about us as we marched over the sea of glass to the gate of the city. Jesus raised His mighty,
          glorious arm, laid hold of the pearly gate, swung it back on its glittering hinges, and said to us, “You have
          washed your robes in My blood, stood stifﬂy for My truth, enter in.” We all marched in and felt that we had a
          perfect right in the city.</p>
      <p>A voice, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, will be heard saying, “Come, ye blessed of my
          Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”</p>
