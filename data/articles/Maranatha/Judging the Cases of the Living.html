    <h1>Chap. 242—Judging the Cases of the Living</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt
          not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. Revelation
          3:3.</strong></p>
      <p>At the time appointed for the <nobr>judgment—the</nobr> close of the 2300 days, in <nobr>1844—began</nobr> the
          work of investigation and blotting out of sins. All who have ever taken upon themselves the name of Christ
          must pass its searching scrutiny. Both the living and the dead are to be judged “out of those things which
          were written in the books, according to their works.” Revelation 20:12.</p>
      <p>Said the Judge: “All will be justiﬁed by their faith and judged by their works.” Sins that have not been
          repented of and forsaken will not be pardoned, and</p>
      <p>blotted out of the books of record, but will stand to witness against the sinner in the day of God....</p>
      <p>There is earnest warfare before all who would subdue the evil tendencies that strive for the mastery. The work
          of preparation is an individual work. We are not saved in groups. The purity and devotion of one will not
          offset the want of these qualities in another. Though all nations are to pass in judgment before God, yet He
          will examine the case of each individual with as close and searching scrutiny as if there were not another
          being upon the earth. Every one must be tested, and found without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.</p>
      <p>The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many years this work has been in progress.
          <nobr>Soon—none</nobr> know how <nobr>soon—it</nobr> will pass to the cases of the living. In the awful
          presence of God our lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it behooves every soul to
          heed the Saviour’s admonition, “Watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.” Mark 13:33. “If therefore
          thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon
          thee.” Revelation 3:3.</p>
