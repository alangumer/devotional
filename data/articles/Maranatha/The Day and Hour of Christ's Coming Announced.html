    <h1>Chap. 279—The Day and Hour of Christ’s Coming Announced</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. Matthew
          24:36.</strong></p>
      <p>The voice of God is heard from heaven, declaring the day and hour of Jesus’ coming, and delivering everlasting
          covenant to His people. Like peals of loudest thunder His words roll through the earth.</p>
      <p>He spoke one sentence, and then paused, while the words were rolling through the earth. The Israel of God stood
          with their eyes ﬁxed upward, listening to the words as they came from the mouth of Jehovah and rolled through
          the earth like peals of loudest thunder. It was awfully solemn. At the end of every sentence the saints
          shouted, “Glory! Hallelujah!”</p>
      <p>The living saints, 144,000 in number, knew and understood the voice, while the wicked thought it was thunder
          and an earthquake.</p>
      <p>The Israel of God stand listening, with their eyes ﬁxed upward. Their countenances are lighted up with His
          glory, and shine as did the face of Moses when he came down from Sinai. The wicked cannot look upon them. And
          when the blessing is pronounced on those who have honored God by keeping His Sabbath holy, there is a mighty
          shout of victory.</p>
      <p>Then commenced the jubilee, when the land should rest.</p>
      <p>A glorious light shone upon them [the saints]. How beautiful they then looked! All marks of care and weariness
          were gone, and health and beauty were seen in every countenance. Their enemies, the heathen around them, fell
          like dead men; they could not endure the light that shone upon the delivered, holy ones. This light and glory
          remained upon them, until Jesus was seen in the clouds of heaven.</p>
      <p>And I saw a ﬂaming cloud come where Jesus stood. Then Jesus ... took His place on the cloud which carried Him
          to the East, where it ﬁrst appeared to the saints on <nobr>earth—a</nobr> small black cloud which was the sign
          of the Son of man. While the cloud was passing from the Holiest to the East, which took a number of days, the
          synagogue of Satan worshipped at the saints’ feet.</p>
