    <h1>Chap. 231—Sound the Note of Alarm</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Proverbs 3:6. In all our ways we should
          acknowledge God, and He will direct our paths. We</strong></p>
      <p>should consult His Word with humble hearts, ask His counsel, and give up our will to His. We can do nothing
          without God.</p>
      <p>There is the highest reason for us to prize the true Sabbath and stand in its defense, for it is the sign which
          distinguishes the people of God from the world. The commandment that the world makes void is the one to which,
          for this very reason, God’s people will give greater honor. It is when the unbelieving cast contempt upon the
          Word of God that the faithful Calebs are called for. It is then that they will stand ﬁrm at the post of duty,
          without parade, and without swerving because of reproach. The unbelieving spies stood ready to destroy Caleb.
          He saw the stones in the hands of those who had brought a false report, but this did not deter him; he had a
          message, and he would bear it. The same spirit will be manifested today by those who are true to God.</p>
      <p>The psalmist says, “They have made void thy law. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above ﬁne
          gold” (Psalm 119:126, 127). When men press close to the side of Jesus, when Christ is abiding in their hearts
          by faith, their love for the commandments of God grows stronger in proportion to the contempt which the world
          heaps upon His holy precepts. It is at this time that the true Sabbath must be brought before the people by
          both pen and voice. As the fourth commandment and those who observe it are ignored and despised, the faithful
          feel that it is the time not to hide their faith but to exalt the law of Jehovah by unfurling the banner on
          which is inscribed the message of the third angel, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Let not those who have the truth as it is in Jesus give sanction, even by their silence, to the work of the
          mystery of iniquity. Let them never cease to sound the note of alarm.... The truth must not be hid, it must
          not be denied or disguised, but</p>
      <p>fully avowed, and boldly proclaimed.</p>
