    <h1>Chap. 336—Historical Persons Present at the Judgment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have sworn by myself, ... That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely, shall
          one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed
          against him shall be ashamed. Isaiah 45:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>Amid the ransomed throng are the apostles of Christ, the heroic Paul, the ardent Peter, the loved and loving
          John, and their truehearted brethren, and with them the vast host of martyrs; while outside the walls, with
          every vile and abominable thing, are those by whom they were persecuted, imprisoned, and slain. There is Nero,
          that monster of cruelty and vice, beholding the joy and exaltation of those whom he once tortured, and in
          whose extremest anguish he found satanic delight. His mother is there to witness the result of her own work;
          to see how the evil stamp of character transmitted to her son, the passions encouraged and developed by her
          inﬂuence and example, have borne fruit in crimes that caused the world to shudder.</p>
      <p>There ... [is] the proud, ambitious Napoleon, whose approach had caused kingdoms to tremble.</p>
      <p>There are papist priests and prelates, who claimed to be Christ’s ambassadors, yet employed the rack, the
          dungeon, and the stake to control the consciences of His people. There are the proud pontiffs who exalted
          themselves above God and presumed to change the law of the Most High. Those pretended fathers of the church
          have an account to render to God from which they would fain be excused. Too late they are made to see that the
          Omniscient One is jealous of His law and that He will in no wise clear the guilty. They learn now that Christ
          identiﬁes His interest with that of His suffering people; and they feel the force of His own words; “Inasmuch
          as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” Matthew 25:40.</p>
      <p>The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God on the charge of high treason against the government
          of heaven. They have none to plead their cause; they are without excuse; and the sentence of eternal death is
          pronounced against them.</p>
