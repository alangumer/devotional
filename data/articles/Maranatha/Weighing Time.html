    <h1>Chap. 34—Weighing Time</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. 1 Samuel 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>I have seen an angel standing with scales in his hands weighing the thoughts and interest of the people of God,
          especially the young. In one scale were the thoughts and interest tending heavenward; in the other were the
          thoughts and interest tending to earth. And in this scale were thrown all the reading of storybooks, thoughts
          of dress and show, vanity, pride, et cetera. Oh, what a solemn moment! the angels of God standing with scales,
          weighing the thoughts of His professed <nobr>children—those</nobr> who claim to be dead to the world and alive
          to God. The scale ﬁlled with thoughts of earth, vanity, and pride quickly went down, notwithstanding weight
          after weight rolled from the scale. The one with the thoughts and interest tending to heaven went quickly up
          as the other went down, and oh, how light it was! I can relate this as I saw it; but never can I give the
          solemn and vivid impression stamped upon my mind, as I saw the angel with the scales weighing the thoughts and
          interest of the people of God. Said the angel: “Can such enter heaven? No, no, never. Tell them the hope they
          now possess is vain, and unless they speedily repent, and obtain salvation, they must perish.” ...</p>
      <p>I saw that many measure themselves among themselves, and compare their lives with the lives of others. This
          should not be. No one but Christ is given us as an example. He is our true Pattern, and each should strive to
          excel in imitating Him....</p>
      <p>I saw that some hardly know as yet what <nobr>self-denial</nobr> or sacriﬁce is, or what it is to suffer for
          the truth’s sake. But none will enter heaven without making a sacriﬁce. A spirit of <nobr>self-denial</nobr>
          and sacriﬁce should be cherished. Some have not sacriﬁced themselves, their own bodies, on the altar of God.
          They indulge in hasty, ﬁtful temper, gratify their appetites, and attend to their own
          <nobr>self-interest,</nobr> regardless of the cause of God. Those who are willing to make any sacriﬁce for
          eternal life, will have it; and it will be worth suffering for, worth crucifying self for, and sacriﬁcing
          every idol for. The far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory swallows up everything and eclipses every
          earthly pleasure.</p>
