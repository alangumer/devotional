      <p><strong>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of
          his glory with exceeding joy. Jude 24.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ was obedient to every requirement of the law....</p>
      <p>By His perfect obedience He has made it possible for every human being to obey God’s commandments. When we
          submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind
          becomes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live His life. This is what it
          means to be clothed with the garment of His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us He sees, not the
          <nobr>ﬁg-leaf</nobr> garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin, but His own robe of righteousness, which
          is perfect obedience to the law of Jehovah.</p>
      <p>Through the plan of redemption, God has provided means for subduing every sinful trait, and resisting every
          temptation, however strong.</p>
      <p>The strongest temptation is no excuse for sin. However great the pressure brought to bear upon the soul,
          transgression is our own act. It is not in the power of earth or hell to compel any one to sin. The will must
          consent, the heart must yield, or passion cannot overbear reason, nor iniquity triumph over
          righteousness.</p>
      <p>If you will stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel, faithfully doing His service, you need
          never yield to temptation; for One stands by your side who is able to keep you from falling.</p>
      <p>We need not retain one sinful propensity.... [Ephesians <nobr>2:1-6</nobr> quoted.] ...</p>
      <p>As we partake of the divine nature, hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong are cut away from the
          character, and we are made a living power for good. Ever learning of the divine Teacher, daily partaking of
          His nature, we cooperate with God in overcoming Satan’s temptations. God works, and man works, that man may be
          one with Christ as Christ is one with God. Then we sit together with Christ in heavenly places. The mind rests
          with peace and assurance in Jesus.</p>
