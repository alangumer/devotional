    <h1>Chap. 160—The False Revival</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall
          destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power
          and signs and lying wonders. 2 Thessalonians 2:8, 9.</strong></p>
      <p>Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, points to the special working of Satan in spiritualism as an
          event to take place immediately before the second advent of Christ. Speaking of Christ’s second coming, he
          declares that it is “after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders.” 2 Thessalonians
          2:9.</p>
      <p>Before the ﬁnal visitation of God’s judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord such a
          revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit and power of God
          will be poured out upon His children. At that time many will separate themselves from those churches in which
          the love of this world has supplanted love for God and His word. Many, both of ministers and people, will
          gladly accept those great truths which God has caused to be proclaimed at this time to prepare a people for
          the Lord’s second coming. The enemy of souls desires to hinder this work; and before the time for such a
          movement shall come, he will endeavor to prevent it by introducing a counterfeit. In those churches which he
          can bring under his deceptive power he will make it appear that God’s special blessing is poured out; there
          will be manifest what is thought to be great religious interest. Multitudes will exult that God is working
          marvelously for them, when the work is that of another spirit. Under a religious guise, Satan will seek to
          extend his inﬂuence over the Christian world.</p>
      <p>Young men and women will be lifted up, and will regard themselves as wonderfully favored, called to do some
          great thing. There will be conversions many, after a peculiar order, but they will not bear the divine
          signature. Immorality will come in, and extravagance, and many will make shipwreck of faith.</p>
