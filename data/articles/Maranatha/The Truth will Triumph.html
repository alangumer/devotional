      <p><strong>The angel ... sware by him that liveth for ever ... that there should be time no longer. Revelation
          10:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>The message of Revelation 14, proclaiming that the hour of God’s judgment is come, is given in the time of the
          end; and the angel of Revelation 10 is represented as having one foot on the sea and one foot on the land,
          showing that the message will be carried to distant lands, the ocean will be crossed, and the islands of the
          sea will hear the proclamation of the last message of warning....</p>
      <p>“And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him
          that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the
          things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer”
          (Revelation 10:5, 6). This message announces the end of the prophetic periods. The disappointment of those who
          expected to see our Lord in 1844 was indeed bitter to those who had so ardently looked for His appearing. It
          was in the Lord’s order that this disappointment should come....</p>
      <p>Not one cloud has fallen upon the church that God has not prepared for; not one opposing force has risen to
          counterwork the work of God but He has foreseen. All has taken place as He has predicted through His prophets.
          He has not left His church in darkness, forsaken, but has traced in prophetic declarations what would occur,
          and through His providence, acting in its appointed place in the world’s history, He has brought about that
          which His Holy Spirit inspired the prophets to foretell. All His purposes will be fulﬁlled and established.
          His law is linked with His throne, and satanic agencies combined with human agencies cannot destroy it. Truth
          is inspired and guarded by God; it will live, and will succeed, although it may appear at times to be
          overshadowed. The gospel of Christ is the law exempliﬁed in character. The deceptions practiced against it,
          every device for vindicating falsehood, every error forged by satanic agencies, will eventually be eternally
          broken, and the triumph of truth will be like the appearing of the sun at noonday. The Sun of Righteousness
          shall shine forth with healing in His wings, and the whole earth shall be ﬁlled with His glory.</p>
