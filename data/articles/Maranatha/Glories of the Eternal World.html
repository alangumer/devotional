    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
          pleasures for evermore. Psalm 16:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The glory of the eternal world has been opened before me. I want to tell you that Heaven is worth winning. It
          should be the aim of your life to ﬁt yourself for association with the redeemed, with holy angels, and with
          Jesus, the world’s Redeemer. If we could have but one view of the celestial city, we would never wish to dwell
          on earth again. There are beautiful landscapes on earth, and I enjoy all these prospects of loveliness in
          nature. I associate them with the Creator. But I know that if I love God, and keep His commandments, there is
          a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory reserved in Heaven for me.</p>
      <p>This earth,... puriﬁed with ﬁre, then ... will be much more beautiful. The grass will be living green, and will
          never wither. There will be roses and lilies, and all kinds of ﬂowers there. They will never blight or fade,
          or lose their beauty and fragrance.</p>
      <p>The lion, we should much dread and fear here, will then lie down with the lamb, and everything in the New Earth
          will be peace and harmony. The trees of the New Earth will be straight and lofty, without deformity.</p>
      <p>The saints will have crowns of glory upon their heads, and harps of gold in their hands. They will play upon
          the golden harp, and sing redeeming love, and make melody unto God. Their former trials and suffering in this
          world will be forgotten and lost amid the glories of the New Earth.</p>
      <p>Let all that is beautiful in our earthly home remind us of the crystal river and green ﬁelds, the waving trees
          and the living fountains, the shining city and the <nobr>white-robed</nobr> singers, of our heavenly
          <nobr>home—that</nobr> world of beauty which no artist can picture and no mortal tongue describe. Let your
          imagination picture the home of the saved, and remember that it will be more glorious than your brightest
          imagination can portray.</p>
      <p>Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of the righteous. It will be known only to those who behold
          it.</p>
