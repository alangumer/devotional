    <h1>Chap. 86—A Standard you can Trust</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. Ephesians
          6:11.</strong></p>
      <p>At every revival of God’s work, the prince of evil is aroused to more intense activity; he is now putting forth
          his utmost efforts for a ﬁnal struggle against Christ and His followers. The last great delusion is soon to
          open before us. Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit
          resemble the true, that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures. By
          their testimony every statement and every miracle must be tested....</p>
      <p>None but those who have fortiﬁed the mind with the truths of the Bible will stand through the last great
          conﬂict. To every soul will come the searching test: Shall I obey God rather than men? The decisive hour is
          even now at hand. Are our feet planted on the rock of God’s immutable word? Are we prepared to stand ﬁrm in
          defense of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus? ...</p>
      <p>It is the ﬁrst and highest duty of every rational being to learn from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to
          walk in the light, and encourage others to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible
          diligently, weighing every thought, and comparing scripture with scripture. With divine help we are to form
          our opinions for ourselves as we are to answer for ourselves before God....</p>
      <p>Jesus promised His disciples: “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he
          shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” John
          14:26. But the teachings of Christ must previously have been stored in the mind, in order for the Spirit of
          God to bring them to our remembrance in the time of peril....</p>
      <p>When the testing time shall come, those who have made God’s word their rule of life will be revealed.... Let
          persecution be kindled, and the halfhearted and</p>
      <p>hypocritical will waver and yield the faith; but the true Christian will stand ﬁrm as a rock, his faith
          stronger, his hope brighter, than in days of prosperity.</p>
