    <h1>Chap. 258—The Four Winds Loosed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in
          their foreheads. Revelation 7:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Angels are belting the world, refusing Satan his claims to supremacy, made because of the vast multitude of his
          adherents. We hear not the voices, we see not with the natural sight the work of these angels, but their hands
          are linked about the world, and with sleepless vigilance they are keeping the armies of Satan at bay till the
          sealing of God’s people shall be accomplished.</p>
      <p>John sees the elements of <nobr>nature—earthquake,</nobr> tempest, and political
          <nobr>strife—represented</nobr> as being held by four angels. These winds are under control until God gives
          the word to let them go. There is the safety of God’s church. The angels of God do His bidding, holding back
          the winds of the earth, that the winds should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree, until
          the servants of God should be sealed in their foreheads.</p>
      <p>The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of
          trust and authority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention ﬁxed upon the events taking
          place about us. They are watching the strained, restless relations that exist among the nations. They observe
          the intensity that is taking possession of every earthly element, and they realize that something great and
          decisive is about to take <nobr>place—that</nobr> the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.</p>
      <p>Angels are now restraining the winds of strife, until the world shall be warned of its coming doom; but a storm
          is gathering, ready to burst upon the earth, and when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there will be
          such a scene of strife as no pen can picture....</p>
      <p>A moment of respite has been graciously given us of God. Every power lent us of heaven is to be used in doing
          the work assigned us by the Lord for those who are perishing in ignorance. The warning message is to be
          sounded in all parts of the world.... A great work is to be done, and this work has been entrusted to those
          who</p>
      <p>know the truth for this time.</p>
