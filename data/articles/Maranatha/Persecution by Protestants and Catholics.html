    <h1>Chap. 186—Persecution by Protestants and Catholics</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
          Matthew 10:22.</strong></p>
      <p>There is no necessity for thinking that we cannot endure persecution; we shall have to go through terrible
          times.</p>
      <p>The persecutions of Protestants by Romanism, by which the religion of Jesus Christ was almost annihilated, will
          be more than rivaled when Protestantism and popery are combined.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people of God erelong will be placed in a most trying position; but all
          those who have walked in the light, and diffused the light, will realize that God interposes in their behalf.
          When everything looks most forbidding, then the Lord will reveal His power to His faithful ones. When the
          nation for which God has worked in such a marvelous manner, and over which He has spread the shield of
          Omnipotence, abandons Protestant principles, and through its legislature gives countenance and support to
          Romanism in limiting religious liberty, then God will work in His own power for His people that are true. The
          tyranny of Rome will be exercised, but Christ is our refuge.</p>
      <p>When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in
          common, shall inﬂuence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant
          America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the inﬂiction of civil penalties upon dissenters
          will inevitably result.</p>
      <p>The Scriptures teach that popery is to regain its lost supremacy, and that the ﬁres of persecution will be
          rekindled through the <nobr>time-serving</nobr> concessions of the <nobr>so-called</nobr> Protestant world. In
          this time of peril we can stand only as we have the truth and the power of God.... The prospect of being
          brought into personal danger</p>
      <p>and distress, need not cause despondency, but should quicken the vigor and hopes of God’s people; for the time
          of their peril is the season for God to grant them clearer manifestations of his power.</p>
