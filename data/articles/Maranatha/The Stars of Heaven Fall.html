    <h1>Chap. 143—The Stars of Heaven Fall</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. Matthew
          24:29.</strong></p>
      <p>In 1833, ... the last of the signs appeared which were promised by the Saviour as tokens of His second advent.
          Said Jesus, “The stars shall fall from heaven.” And John in the Revelation declared, as he beheld in vision
          the scenes that should herald the day of God, “The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a ﬁg tree
          casteth her untimely ﬁgs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.” This prophecy received a striking and
          impressive fulﬁlment in the great meteoric shower of November 13, 1833. That was the most extensive and
          wonderful display of falling stars which has ever been recorded; “the whole ﬁrmament, over all the United
          States, being then, for hours, in ﬁery commotion! No celestial phenomenon has ever occurred in this country,
          since its ﬁrst settlement, which was viewed with such intense admiration by one class in the community, or
          with so much dread and alarm by another.” “Its sublimity and awful beauty still linger in many minds.... Never
          did rain fall much</p>
      <p>thicker than the meteors fell toward the earth; east, west, north, and south, it was the same. In a word, the
          whole heavens seemed in motion.... The display, as described</p>
      <p>in Professor Silliman’s Journal, was seen all over North America.... From two</p>
      <p>o’clock until broad daylight, ... an incessant play of dazzlingly brilliant luminosities was kept up in the
          whole <nobr>heavens.”—R.</nobr> M. Devens, American Progress; or, The Great Events of the Greatest Century,
          ch. 28, pars. <nobr>1-5....</nobr></p>
      <p>Thus was displayed the last of those signs of His coming, concerning which Jesus bade His disciples, “When ye
          shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.” After these signs, John beheld, as the
          great event next impending, the heavens departing as a scroll, while the earth quaked, mountains and islands
          removed out of their places, and the wicked in terror sought to ﬂee from the presence of the Son of man.</p>
      <p>But the day and the hour of His coming Christ has not revealed.... The exact</p>
      <p>time of the second coming of the Son of man is God’s mystery.</p>
