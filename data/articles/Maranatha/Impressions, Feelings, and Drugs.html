    <h1>Chap. 225—Impressions, Feelings, and Drugs</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. Psalm
          119:104.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many restless spirits who will not submit to discipline, system, and order. They think that their
          liberties would be abridged were they to lay aside their own judgment and submit to the judgment of those of
          experience. The work of God will not progress unless there is a disposition to submit to order and expel the
          reckless, disorderly spirit of fanaticism from their meetings.</p>
      <p>Impressions and feelings are no sure evidence that a person is led by the Lord. Satan will, if he is
          unsuspected, give feelings and impressions. These are not safe guides. All should thoroughly acquaint
          themselves with the evidences of our faith, and the great study should be how they can adorn their profession
          and bear fruit to the glory of God....</p>
      <p>For some time he [a patient at the Battle Creek Sanitarium] had thought he was obtaining new light. He was very
          ill, and must soon die.... Those to whom</p>
      <p>he presented his views listened to him eagerly, and some thought him inspired....</p>
      <p>To many his reasoning seemed to be without a ﬂaw. They told of his powerful exhortations in his sickroom. Most
          wonderful views passed before him. But what was the source of his inspiration? It was the morphine given him
          to relieve his pain.</p>
      <p>The poisons contained in many <nobr>so-called</nobr> remedies create habits and appetites that mean ruin to
          both soul and body. Many of the popular nostrums called patent medicines, and even some of the drugs dispensed
          by physicians, act a part in laying the foundation of the liquor habit, the opium habit, the morphine habit,
          that are so terrible a curse to society.</p>
      <p>If the blessing that those who claim to be sanctiﬁed have received, leads them to rely upon some particular
          emotion, and they declare there is no need of searching the Scriptures that they may know God’s revealed will,
          then the supposed blessing is a counterfeit, for it leads its possessors to place value on their own
          unsanctiﬁed emotions and fancies, and to close their ears to the voice of God in His word.</p>
