    <h1>Chap. 255—Human Probation Closes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is ﬁlthy, let him be ﬁlthy still: and he that
          is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. Revelation
          22:11.</strong></p>
      <p>When the work of the investigative judgment closes, the destiny of all will have been decided for life or
          death. Probation is ended a short time before the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven.</p>
      <p>Scoffers pointed to the things of <nobr>nature—to</nobr> the unvarying succession of the seasons, to the blue
          skies that had never poured out rain, to the green ﬁelds refreshed by the soft dews of <nobr>night—and</nobr>
          they cried out: “Doth he not speak parables?” In contempt they declared the preacher of righteousness to be a
          wild enthusiast; and they went on, more eager in their pursuit of pleasure, more intent upon their evil ways,
          than before. But their unbelief did not hinder the predicted event. God bore long with their wickedness,
          giving them ample opportunity for repentance; but at the appointed time His judgments were visited upon the
          rejecters of His mercy.</p>
      <p>Christ declares that there will exist similar unbelief concerning His second coming. As the people of Noah’s
          day “knew not until the ﬂood came, and took them all away; so,” in the words of our Saviour, “shall also the
          coming of the Son of man be.” Matthew 24:39. When the professed people of God are uniting with the world,
          living as they live, and joining with them in forbidden pleasures; when the luxury of the world becomes the
          luxury of the church; when the marriage bells are chiming, and all are looking forward to many years of
          worldly <nobr>prosperity—then,</nobr> suddenly as the lightning ﬂashes from the heavens, will come the end of
          their bright visions and delusive hopes.</p>
      <p>The events connected with the close of probation and the work of preparation for the time of trouble, are
          clearly presented. But multitudes have no more understanding of these important truths than if they had never
          been revealed. Satan watches to catch away every impression that would make them wise unto salvation, and the
          time of trouble will ﬁnd them unready.</p>
