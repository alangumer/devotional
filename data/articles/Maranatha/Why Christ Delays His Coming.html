    <h1>Chap. 53—Why Christ Delays His Coming</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But this I do say, brothers. The appointed time has grown very short. 1 Corinthians 7:29,
          Goodspeed.</strong></p>
      <p>The angels of God in their messages to men represent time as very short. Thus it has always been presented to
          me. It is true that time has continued longer than we expected in the early days of this message. Our Saviour
          did not appear as soon as we hoped. But has the word of the Lord failed? Never! It should be remembered that
          the promises and threatenings of God are alike conditional.</p>
      <p>God had committed to His people a work to be accomplished on earth. The third angel’s message was to be given,
          the minds of believers were to be directed to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ had entered to make
          atonement for His people. The Sabbath reform was to be carried forward. The breach in the law of God must be
          made up. The message must be proclaimed with a loud voice, that all the inhabitants of earth might receive the
          warning. The people of God must purify their souls through obedience to the truth, and be prepared to stand
          without fault before Him at His coming.</p>
      <p>Had Adventists, after the great disappointment in 1844, held fast their faith, and followed on unitedly in the
          opening providence of God, receiving the message of the third angel and in the power of the Holy Spirit
          proclaiming it to the world,</p>
      <p>...the Lord would have wrought mightily with their efforts, the work would have been completed, and Christ
          would have come ere this to receive His people to their reward.</p>
      <p>But in the period of doubt and uncertainty that followed the disappointment, many of the advent believers
          yielded their faith.... Thus the work was hindered, and</p>
      <p>the world was left in darkness....</p>
      <p>For forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut out ancient Israel from the land of Canaan. The
          same sins have delayed the entrance of modern Israel into the heavenly Canaan. In neither case were the
          promises of God at fault. It is the unbelief, the worldliness, unconsecration, and strife among the Lord’s
          professed people that have kept us in this world of sin and sorrow so many years.</p>
