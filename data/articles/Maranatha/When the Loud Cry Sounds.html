    <h1>Chap. 19—When the Loud Cry Sounds</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
          nearer than when we believed. Romans 13:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The end is near, stealing upon us stealthily, imperceptibly, like the noiseless approach of a thief in the
          night. May the Lord grant that we shall no longer sleep as do others, but that we shall watch and be sober.
          The truth is soon to triumph gloriously, and all who now choose to be laborers together with God, will triumph
          with it. The time is short; the night soon cometh when no man can work....</p>
      <p>The time is coming when there will be as many converted in a day as there were on the day of Pentecost, after
          the disciples had received the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>Many have let the gospel invitation go unheeded; they have been tested and tried; but mountainous obstacles
          have seemed to loom up before their faces, blocking their onward march. Through faith, perseverance, and
          courage, many will surmount these obstructions and walk out into the glorious light.</p>
      <p>Almost unconsciously barriers have been erected in the strait and narrow way; stones of stumbling have been
          placed in the path; these will all be rolled away. The safeguards which false shepherds have thrown around
          their ﬂocks will become as nought; thousands will step out into the light, and work to spread the light.
          Heavenly intelligences will combine with the human agencies. Thus encouraged, the church will indeed arise and
          shine, throwing all her sanctiﬁed energies into the contest; thus the design of God is accomplished; the lost
          pearls are recovered....</p>
      <p>During the loud cry, the church, aided by the providential interpositions of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the
          knowledge of salvation so abundantly that light will be communicated to every city and town. The earth will be
          ﬁlled with the knowledge of salvation. So abundantly will the renewing Spirit of God have crowned with success
          the intensely active agencies, that the light of present truth will be seen ﬂashing everywhere.</p>
