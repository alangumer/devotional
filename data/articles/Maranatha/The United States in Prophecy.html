    <h1>Chap. 185—The United States in Prophecy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a
          dragon. Revelation 13:11.</strong></p>
      <p>One nation, and only one, meets the speciﬁcations of this prophecy; it points unmistakably to the United States
          of America.</p>
      <p>Here is a striking ﬁgure of the rise and growth of our own nation. And the <nobr>lamb-like</nobr> horns,
          emblems or innocence and gentleness, well represent the character of our government, as expressed in its two
          fundamental principles, Republicanism and Protestantism.</p>
      <p>The Lord has done more for the United States than for any other country upon which the sun shines. Here He
          provided an asylum for His people, where they could worship Him according to the dictates of conscience. Here
          Christianity has progressed in its purity. The <nobr>life-giving</nobr> doctrine of the one Mediator between
          God and man has been freely taught. God designed that this country should ever remain free for all people to
          worship Him in accordance with the dictates of conscience. He designed that its civil institutions, in their
          expansive productions, should represent the freedom of gospel privileges.</p>
      <p>But the enemy of all righteousness has designs upon God’s purpose for this country. He will bring in
          enterprises that will lead men to forget that there is a God. Worldliness and covetousness, which is idolatry,
          will prevail through the working of the archdeceiver, till the law of God, in all its bearings, shall be made
          void.</p>
      <p>I have been shown that Satan is stealing a march upon us. The law of God, through the agency of Satan, is to be
          made void. In our land of boasted freedom, religious liberty will come to an end.</p>
      <p>When our nation, in its legislative councils, shall enact laws to bind the consciences of men in regard to
          their religious privileges, enforcing Sunday observance, and bringing oppressive power to bear against those
          who keep the <nobr>seventh-day</nobr> Sabbath, the law of God will, to all intents and purposes, be made void
          in our land; and national apostasy will be followed by national ruin.</p>
