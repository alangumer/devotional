    <h1>Chap. 299—Satan is Bound</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his
          hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a
          thousand years. Revelation 20:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The revelator foretells the banishment of Satan and the condition of chaos and desolation to which the earth is
          to be reduced, and he declares that this condition will exist for a thousand years. After presenting the
          scenes of the Lord’s second coming and the destruction of the wicked, the prophecy continues: “I saw an angel
          come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on
          the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into
          the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till
          the thousand years should be fulﬁlled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.” Revelation
          <nobr>20:1-3.</nobr></p>
      <p>That the expression “bottomless pit” represents the earth in a state of confusion and darkness is evident from
          other scriptures. Concerning the condition of the earth “in the beginning,” the Bible record says that it “was
          without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.” Genesis 1:2. Prophecy teaches that it
          will be brought back, partially at least, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day of God, the
          prophet Jeremiah declares: “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and
          they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld,
          and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were ﬂed. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place
          was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down.” Jeremiah <nobr>4:23-26.</nobr></p>
      <p>Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years. Limited to the earth, he will not
          have access to other worlds to tempt and annoy those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that he is
          bound: there are none remaining, upon whom he can exercise his power. He is wholly cut off from the work of
          deception and ruin which for so many centuries has been his sole delight.</p>
