    <h1>Chap. 206—All Nations Follow America’s Lead</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When all the people heard the sound of the cornet, ﬂute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of
          musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that
          Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Daniel 3:7.</strong></p>
      <p>History will be repeated. False religion will be exalted. The ﬁrst day of the week, a common working day,
          possessing no sanctity whatever, will be set up as was the image at Babylon. All nations and tongues and
          peoples will be commanded to worship this spurious sabbath. This is Satan’s plan to make of no account the day
          instituted by God, and given to the world as a memorial of creation.</p>
      <p>The decree enforcing the worship of this day is to go forth to all the world.</p>
      <p>As America, the land of religious liberty, shall unite with the papacy in forcing the conscience and compelling
          men to honor the false sabbath, the people of every country on the globe will be led to follow her
          example.</p>
      <p>Foreign nations will follow the example of the United States. Though she leads out, yet the same crisis will
          come upon our people in all parts of the world.</p>
      <p>Nations will be stirred to their very center. Support will be withdrawn from those who proclaim God’s only
          standard of righteousness, the only sure test of character. And all who will not bow to the decree of the
          national councils and obey the national laws to exalt the sabbath instituted by the man of sin, to the
          disregard of God’s holy day, will feel, not the oppressive power of popery alone, but of the Protestant world,
          the image of the beast.</p>
      <p>The season of distress before God’s people will call for a faith that will not falter. His children must make
          it manifest that He is the only object of their worship, and that no consideration, not even that of life
          itself, can induce them to make the least concession to false worship. To the loyal heart the commands of
          sinful, ﬁnite men will sink into insigniﬁcance beside the word of the eternal God. Truth will be obeyed though
          the result be imprisonment or exile or death.</p>
