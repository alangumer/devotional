    <h1>Chap. 328—Christ Again Returns to the Earth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten
          thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all. Jude 14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>At the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to the earth. He is accompanied by the host of the
          redeemed and attended by a retinue of angels. As He descends in terriﬁc majesty He bids the wicked dead arise
          to receive their doom. They come forth, a mighty host, numberless as the sands of the sea. What a contrast to
          those who were raised at the ﬁrst resurrection! The righteous were clothed with immortal youth and beauty. The
          wicked bear the traces of disease and death.</p>
      <p>Every eye in that vast multitude is turned to behold the glory of the Son of God. With one voice the wicked
          hosts exclaim: “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!” It is not love to Jesus that inspires this
          utterance. The force of truth urges the words from unwilling lips. As the wicked went into their graves, so
          they come forth with the same enmity to Christ and the same spirit of rebellion. They are to have no new
          probation in which to remedy the defects of their past lives. Nothing would be gained by this. A lifetime of
          transgression has not softened their hearts. A second probation, were it given them, would be occupied as was
          the ﬁrst in evading the requirements of God and exciting rebellion against Him.</p>
      <p>Christ descends upon the Mount of Olives, whence, after His resurrection, He ascended, and where angels
          repeated the promise of His return. Says the prophet: “The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with
          thee.” “And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east,
          and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof, ... and there shall be a very great valley.” “And
          the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.” Zechariah
          14:5, 4, 9. As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes down out of heaven, it rests upon the place
          puriﬁed and made ready to receive it, and Christ, with His people and the angels, enters the Holy City.</p>
