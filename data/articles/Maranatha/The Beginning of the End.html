    <h1>Chap. 207—The Beginning of the End</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Evil on evil! says the Lord the <nobr>Eternal—it</nobr> is coming, the hour has come, the hour is
          striking, and striking at you, the hour and the end! Ezekiel 7:5, 6, Moffatt.</strong></p>
      <p>Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The powers of earth, uniting to war against the
          commandments of God, will decree that all, “both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,” shall conform
          to the customs of the church by observance of the false sabbath. All who refuse compliance will be visited
          with civil penalties, and it will ﬁnally be declared that they are deserving of death. On the other hand, the
          law of God enjoining the Creator’s rest day demands obedience, and threatens wrath against all who transgress
          its precepts.</p>
      <p>With the issue thus clearly brought before him, whosoever shall trample upon God’s law to obey a human
          enactment, receives the mark of the beast; he accepts the sign of allegiance to the power which he chooses to
          obey instead of God....</p>
      <p>The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty; for it is the point of truth especially controverted. When the
          ﬁnal test shall be brought to bear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who
          serve God and those who serve Him not. While the observance of the false sabbath in compliance with the law of
          the state, contrary to the fourth commandment, will be an avowal of an allegiance to a power that is in
          opposition to God, the keeping of the true Sabbath, in obedience to God’s law, is an evidence of loyalty to
          the Creator. While one class, by accepting the sign of submission to earthly powers, receive the mark of the
          beast, the other, choosing the token of allegiance to divine authority, receive the seal of God.</p>
      <p>Heretofore those who presented the truths of the third angel’s message have been often regarded as mere
          alarmists.... But as the question of enforcing Sunday</p>
      <p>observance is widely agitated, the event so long doubted and disbelieved is seen to be approaching, and the
          third message will produce an effect which it could not have had before.</p>
