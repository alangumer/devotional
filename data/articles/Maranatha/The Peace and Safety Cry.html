    <h1>Chap. 252—The Peace and Safety Cry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there
          is no peace. Jeremiah 6:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Papists, Protestants, and worldlings will ... see in this union a grand movement for the conversion of the
          world and the ushering in of the <nobr>long-expected</nobr> millennium.</p>
      <p>“The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great
          noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be
          burned up.” 2 Peter 3:10. When the reasoning of philosophy has banished the fear of God’s judgments; when
          religious teachers are pointing forward to long ages of peace and prosperity, and the world are absorbed in
          their rounds of business and pleasure, planting and building, feasting and merrymaking, rejecting God’s
          warnings and mocking His <nobr>messengers—then</nobr> it is that sudden destruction cometh upon them, and they
          shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3.</p>
      <p>Like the dwellers in the vale of Siddim, the people are dreaming of prosperity and peace. “Escape for thy
          life,” is the warning from the angels of God; but other voices are heard saying, “Be not excited; there is no
          cause for alarm.” The multitudes cry, “Peace and safety,” while Heaven declares that swift destruction is
          about to come upon the transgressor. On the night prior to their destruction, the cities of the plain rioted
          in pleasure and derided the fears and warnings of the messenger of God; but those scoffers perished in the
          ﬂames; that very night the door of mercy was forever closed to the wicked, careless inhabitants of Sodom. God
          will not always be mocked; He will not long be triﬂed with. “Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both
          with wrath and ﬁerce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.”
          Isaiah 13:9. The great mass of the world will reject God’s mercy, and will be overwhelmed in swift and
          irretrievable ruin. But those who heed the warning shall dwell “in the secret place of the most High,” and
          “abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” His truth shall be their shield and buckler.</p>
