    <h1>Chap. 267—The Great Time of Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In those days shall be afﬂiction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created
          unto this time, neither shall be. Mark 13:19.</strong></p>
      <p>The time of trouble such as never was, is soon to open upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do not
          now possess, and which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in
          anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation cannot
          reach the magnitude of the ordeal. And now, while the precious Saviour is making an atonement for us, we
          should seek to become perfect in Christ. God’s providence is the school in which we are to learn the meekness
          and lowliness of Jesus. The Lord is ever setting before us, not the way we would choose, which is easier and
          pleasanter to us, but the true aims of life. None can neglect or defer this work but at the most fearful peril
          to their souls.</p>
      <p>The apostle John in vision heard a loud voice in Heaven exclaiming, “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of
          the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short
          time.” Fearful are the scenes which call forth this exclamation from the heavenly voice. The wrath of Satan
          increases as his time grows short, and his work of deceit and destruction reaches its culmination in the time
          of trouble. God’s <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> has ended. The world has rejected His mercy, despised His love,
          and trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed the boundary of their probation, and the Lord withdraws His
          protection, and leaves them to the mercy of the leader they have chosen. Satan will have power over those who
          have yielded themselves to his control, and he will plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one great, ﬁnal
          trouble. As the angels of God cease to hold in check the ﬁerce winds of human passion, all the elements of
          strife will be let loose. The whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that which came upon
          Jerusalem of old.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the time of <nobr>trouble—trouble</nobr> such as has not been since there was a
          <nobr>nation—His</nobr> [God’s] chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot
          destroy the weakest of God’s saints.</p>
