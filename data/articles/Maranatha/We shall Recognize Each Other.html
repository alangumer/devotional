    <h1>Chap. 295—We shall Recognize Each Other</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then shall I know even as also I am known. 1 Corinthians 13:12.</strong></p>
      <p>We shall know our friends, even as the disciples knew Jesus. They may have been deformed, diseased, or
          disﬁgured, in this mortal life, and they rise in perfect health and symmetry; yet in the gloriﬁed body their
          identity will be perfectly preserved.... In the face radiant with the light shining from the face of Jesus,
          we</p>
      <p>shall recognize the lineaments of those we love.</p>
      <p>The redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What
          blessed converse they have with these souls! “I was a sinner,” it will be said, “without God and without hope
          in the world, and you came to me and drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope....”
          Others</p>
      <p>will say, “I was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your friends and comfortable home and came to teach me
          how to ﬁnd Jesus and believe in Him as the only true God. I demolished my idols and worshiped God, and now I
          see Him face to face. I am saved, eternally saved, ever to behold Him whom I love....”</p>
      <p>Others will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry and clothed the naked. “When despair bound my
          soul in unbelief, the Lord sent you to me,” they say, “to speak words of hope and comfort. You brought me food
          for my physical necessities, and you opened to me the Word of God, awakening me to my spiritual needs. You
          treated me as a brother. You sympathized with me in my sorrows, and restored my bruised and wounded soul, so
          that I could grasp the hand of Christ that was reached out to save me. In my ignorance you taught me patiently
          that I had a Father in heaven who cared for me. You read to me the precious promises of God’s Word. You
          inspired in me the faith that He would save me. My heart was softened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated the
          sacriﬁce which Christ had made for me.... I</p>
      <p>am here, saved, eternally saved, ever to live in His presence and to praise Him who gave His life for me.”</p>
      <p>What rejoicing there will be as these redeemed ones meet and greet those who have had a burden in their behalf!
          And those who have lived, not to please themselves, but to be a blessing to the unfortunate who have so few
          <nobr>blessings—how</nobr> their hearts will thrill with satisfaction!</p>
