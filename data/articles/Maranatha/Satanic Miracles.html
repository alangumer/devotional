      <p><strong>And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh ﬁre come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of
          men. Revelation 13:13.</strong></p>
      <p>As the people of God approach the perils of the last days, Satan holds earnest consultation with his angels as
          to the most successful plan of overthrowing their faith. He sees that the popular churches are already lulled
          to sleep by his deceptive power. By pleasing sophistry and lying wonders he can continue to hold them under
          his control. Therefore he directs his angels to lay their snares especially for those who are looking for the
          second advent of Christ and endeavoring to keep all the commandments of God.</p>
      <p>We are warned that in the last days he will work with signs and lying wonders. And he will continue these
          wonders until the close of probation, that he may point to them as evidence that he is an angel of light and
          not of darkness.</p>
      <p>Satan will come in to deceive if possible the very elect. He claims to be Christ, and he is coming in,
          pretending to be the great medical missionary. He will cause ﬁre to come down from heaven in the sight of men
          to prove that he is God.</p>
      <p>It is the lying wonders of the devil that will take the world captive, and he will cause ﬁre to come down from
          heaven in the sight of men. He is to work miracles; and this wonderful, <nobr>miracle-working</nobr> power is
          to sweep in the whole world.</p>
      <p>Some will be tempted to receive these wonders as from God. The sick will be healed before us. Miracles will be
          performed in our sight. Are we prepared for the trial which awaits us when the lying wonders of Satan shall be
          more fully exhibited? Will not many souls be ensnared and taken? By departing from the plain precepts and
          commandments of God, and giving heed to fables, the minds of many are preparing to receive these lying
          wonders. We must all now seek to arm ourselves for the contest in which we must soon engage. Faith in God’s
          word, prayerfully studied and practically applied, will be our shield from Satan’s power and will bring us off
          conquerors through the blood of Christ.</p>
