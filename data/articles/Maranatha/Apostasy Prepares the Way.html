    <h1>Chap. 157—Apostasy Prepares the Way</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away
          ﬁrst, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. 2 Thessalonians 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>When the early church became corrupted by departing from the simplicity of the gospel and accepting heathen
          rites and customs, she lost the Spirit and power of God; and in order to control the consciences of the
          people, she sought the support of the secular power. The result was the papacy, a church that controlled the
          power of the state and employed it to further her own ends, especially for the punishment of “heresy.”...</p>
      <p>Whenever the church has obtained secular power, she has employed it to punish dissent from her doctrines.
          Protestant churches that have followed in the steps of Rome by forming alliance with worldly powers have
          manifested a similar desire to restrict liberty of conscience. An example of this is given in the
          <nobr>long-continued</nobr> persecution of dissenters by the Church of England. During the sixteenth and
          seventeenth centuries, thousands of nonconformist ministers were forced to ﬂee from their churches, and many,
          both of pastors and people, were subjected to ﬁne, imprisonment, torture, and martyrdom.</p>
      <p>It was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the civil government, and this prepared the way
          for the development of the <nobr>papacy—the</nobr> beast. Said Paul: “There” shall “come a falling away...,
          and that man of sin be revealed.” 2 Thessalonians 2:3. So apostasy in the church will prepare the way for the
          image to the beast.</p>
      <p>Satan will work with all power and “with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.” 2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10. His
          working is plainly revealed by the rapidly increasing darkness, the multitudinous errors, heresies, and
          delusions of these last days. Not only is Satan leading the world captive, but his deceptions are leavening
          the professed churches of our Lord Jesus Christ. The great apostasy will develop into darkness deep as
          midnight. To God’s people it will be a night of trial, a night of weeping, a night of persecution for the
          truth’s sake. But out of that night of darkness God’s light will shine.</p>
