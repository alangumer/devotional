    <h1>Chap. 103—In Partnership with Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
          fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. John 15:5.</strong></p>
      <p>The end is near! God calls upon the church to set in order the things that remain. Workers together with God,
          you are empowered by the Lord to take others with you into the kingdom. You are to be God’s living agents,
          channels of light to the world, and round about you are angels of heaven with their commission from Christ to
          sustain, strengthen, and uphold you in working for the salvation of souls....</p>
      <p>Stand out separate and distinct from the <nobr>world—in</nobr> the world, but not of it, reﬂecting the bright
          beams of the Sun of Righteousness, being pure, holy, and undeﬁled, and in faith carrying light into all the
          highways and byways of the earth.</p>
      <p>Let the churches awake before it is everlastingly too late. Let every member take up his individual work and
          vindicate the name of the Lord by which he is called. Let sound faith and earnest piety take the place of
          slothfulness and unbelief. When faith lays hold upon Christ, the truth will bring delight to the soul, and the
          services of religion will not be dull and uninteresting.... Daily you will have a rich experience</p>
      <p>as you practice the Christianity you profess. Sinners will be converted....</p>
      <p>Oh, that all may arouse and manifest to the world that theirs is a living faith, that a vital issue is before
          the world, that Jesus will soon come. Let men see that we believe that we are on the borders of the eternal
          world.</p>
      <p>The upbuilding of the kingdom of God is retarded or urged forward according to the unfaithfulness or ﬁdelity of
          human agencies. The work is hindered by the failure of the human to cooperate with the divine. Men may pray,
          “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”; but if they fail of acting out this prayer
          in their lives, their petitions will be fruitless. But though you may be weak, erring, and sinful, the Lord
          holds out to you the offer of partnership with Himself. He invites you to come under divine instruction.
          Uniting with Christ, you may work the works of God. “Without me,” Christ said, “ye can do nothing.”</p>
