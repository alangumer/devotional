    <h1>Chap. 35—Will You Stand the Test?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to
          humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments,
          or no. Deuteronomy 8:2.</strong></p>
      <p>God will prove His people.... If the message [the 1844 proclamation] had been</p>
      <p>of as short duration as many of us supposed, there would have been no time for them to develop character. Many
          moved from feeling, not from principle and faith, and this solemn, fearful message stirred them. It wrought
          upon their feelings, and excited their fears, but did not accomplish the work which God designed that it
          should....</p>
      <p>God leads His people on, step by step. He brings them up to different points calculated to manifest what is in
          the heart. Some endure at one point, but fall off at the next. At every advanced point the heart is tested and
          tried a little closer. If the professed people of God ﬁnd their hearts opposed to this straight work, it
          should convince them that they have a work to do to overcome.... Some are willing to</p>
      <p>receive one point; but when God brings them to another testing point, they shrink from it and stand back,
          because they ﬁnd that it strikes directly at some cherished idol. Here they have opportunity to see what is in
          their hearts that shuts out Jesus. They prize something higher than the truth, and their hearts are not
          prepared to receive Jesus. Individuals are tested and proved a length of time to see if they will sacriﬁce
          their idols.... Those who come up to every point, and stand every test, and</p>
      <p>overcome, be the price what it may, have heeded the counsel of the True Witness, and they will receive the
          latter rain, and thus be ﬁtted for translation.</p>
      <p>God proves His people in this world.... Here, in this world, in these last days,</p>
      <p>persons will show what power affects their hearts and controls their actions. If it is the power of divine
          truth, it will lead to good works. It will elevate the receiver, and make him noblehearted and generous, like
          his divine Lord....</p>
      <p>Young and old, God is now testing you. You are deciding your own eternal destiny.</p>
