    <h1>Chap. 154—Satan’s Groundwork for the Final Conﬂict</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he
          shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and
          half a time. Daniel 7:25, R.V.</strong></p>
      <p>During the Christian dispensation, the great enemy of man’s happiness has made the Sabbath of the fourth
          commandment an object of special attack. Satan says, “I will work at cross purposes with God. I will empower
          my followers to set aside God’s memorial, the <nobr>seventh-day</nobr> Sabbath. Thus I will show the world
          that the day sanctiﬁed and blessed by God has been changed. That day shall not live in the minds of the
          people. I will obliterate the memory of it. I will place in its stead a day that does not bear the credentials
          of God, a day that cannot be a sign between God and His people. I will lead those who accept this day to place
          upon it the sanctity that God placed upon the seventh day.</p>
      <p>“Through my vicegerent, I will exalt myself. The ﬁrst day will be extolled, and the Protestant world will
          receive this spurious sabbath as genuine. Through the nonobservance of the Sabbath that God instituted, I will
          bring His law into contempt. The words, “A sign between me and you throughout your generations,’ I will make
          to serve on the side of my sabbath.</p>
      <p>“Thus the world will become mine. I will be the ruler of the earth, the prince of the world. I will so control
          the minds under my power that God’s Sabbath shall be a special object of contempt. A sign? I will make the
          observance of the seventh day a sign of disloyalty to the authorities of earth. Human laws will be made so
          stringent that men and women will not dare to observe the <nobr>seventh-day</nobr> Sabbath. For fear of
          wanting food and clothing, they will join with the world in transgressing God’s law. The earth will be wholly
          under my dominion.”</p>
      <p>The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially controverted. When the
          ﬁnal test shall be brought to bear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who
          serve God and those who serve Him not.</p>
