    <h1>Chap. 102—Pathway to Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
          destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
          leadeth unto life, and few there be that ﬁnd it. Matthew 7:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ calls upon us to enter the narrow pathway, where every step means a denial of self. He calls upon us to
          stand upon the platform of eternal truth, and contend, yes, contend earnestly, for the faith once delivered to
          the saints....</p>
      <p>As we near the time when principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places will be fully
          brought into the warfare against the truth, when Satan’s deceptive power will be so great that, if it were
          possible, he would deceive the very elect, our discernment must be sharpened by divine enlightenment, that we
          may not be ignorant of Satan’s devices.... By giving us the cooperation of the holy angels,</p>
      <p>God has made it possible for our work to be ... a glorious success. But success will seldom result from
          scattered effort. The united inﬂuence of all the members of the church is required.</p>
      <p>The church today needs men who, like Enoch, walk with God, revealing Christ to the world.
          <nobr>Church-members</nobr> need to reach a higher standard. Heavenly messengers are waiting to communicate
          with those who have sunk self out of sight, whose lives are a fulﬁlling of the words, “I live; ye not I, but
          Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the ﬂesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who
          loved me, and gave himself for me.” Of such men and women must the church be composed before her light can
          shine forth to the world in clear, distinct rays. Our views of the Sun of Righteousness are clouded by
          <nobr>self-seeking.</nobr> Christ is cruciﬁed afresh by many who through <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> allow
          Satan to gain control over them....</p>
      <p>It is God’s purpose that all shall be tested and tried, that He may see whether they are loyal or disloyal to
          the laws that govern the kingdom of heaven. To the last, God permits Satan to reveal himself as a liar, an
          accuser, and a murderer. Thus the ﬁnal triumph of His people is made more marked, more glorious, more full and
          complete.</p>
