    <h1>Chap. 181—Confusion of Many Voices</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of
          her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. Revelation 18:4.</strong></p>
      <p>In the last work for the warning of the world, two distinct calls are made to the churches. The second angel’s
          message is, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of
          the wrath of her fornication.” And in the loud cry of the third angel’s message a voice is heard from heaven
          saying, “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
          plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.”</p>
      <p>As God called the children of Israel out of Egypt, that they might keep His Sabbath, so He calls His people out
          of Babylon, that they may not worship the beast or his image....</p>
      <p>After the truth has been proclaimed as a witness to all nations, every conceivable power of evil will be set in
          operation, and minds will be confused by many voices crying, “Lo, here is Christ, Lo, He is there. This is the
          truth, I have the message from God, He has sent me with great light.” Then there will be a removing of the
          landmarks, and an attempt to tear down the pillars of our faith. A more decided effort will be made to exalt
          the false sabbath, and to cast contempt upon God Himself by supplanting the day He has blessed and sanctiﬁed.
          This false sabbath is to be enforced by an oppressive law.... But while Satan works with his lying
          wonders,</p>
      <p>the time will be fulﬁlled foretold in the Revelation, and the mighty angel that shall lighten the earth with
          his glory, will proclaim the fall of Babylon, and call upon God’s people to forsake her.</p>
      <p>When do her sins reach unto heaven? When the law of God is ﬁnally made void by legislation. Then the extremity
          of God’s people is His opportunity to show who is the governor of heaven and earth. As a Satanic power is
          stirring up the elements from beneath, God will send light and power to His people, that the message of truth
          may be proclaimed to all the world.</p>
