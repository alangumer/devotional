    <h1>Chap. 110—God’s Call to Reform</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
          children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Luke
          1:17.</strong></p>
      <p>John the Baptist went forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord and to turn the
          people to the wisdom of the just. He was a representative of those living in these last days to whom God has
          entrusted sacred truths to present before the people to prepare the way for the second appearing of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>Those who are to prepare the way for the second coming of Christ are represented by faithful Elijah, as John
          came in the spirit of Elijah to prepare the way for Christ’s ﬁrst advent. The great subject of reform is to be
          agitated, and the public mind is to be stirred. Temperance in all things is to be connected with the message,
          to turn the people of God from their idolatry, their gluttony, and their extravagance in dress and other
          things.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> humility, and temperance required of the righteous, whom God especially leads and
          blesses, is to be presented to the people in contrast to the extravagant, <nobr>health-destroying</nobr>
          habits of those who live in this degenerate age. God has shown that health reform is as closely connected with
          the third angel’s message as the hand is with the body. There is nowhere to be found so great a cause of
          physical and moral degeneracy as a neglect of this important subject. Those who indulge appetite and passion,
          and close their eyes to the light for fear they will see sinful indulgences which they are unwilling to
          forsake, are guilty before God....</p>
      <p>Providence has been leading the people of God out from the extravagant habits of the world, away from the
          indulgence of appetite and passion, to take their stand upon the platform of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and
          temperance in all things. The people whom God is leading will be peculiar. They will not be like the world.
          But if they follow the leadings of God they will accomplish His purposes, and will yield their will to His
          will. Christ will dwell in the heart.... Your body, says the apostle, is the temple</p>
      <p>of the Holy Ghost.</p>
