    <h1>Chap. 126—The Perils of False Science</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and
          oppositions of science falsely so called. 1 Timothy 6:20.</strong></p>
      <p>In New Hampshire there were those who were active in disseminating false ideas in regard to God. Light was
          given me that these men were making the truth of no effect by their ideas, some of which led to
          <nobr>free-lovism.</nobr> I was shown that these men were seducing souls by presenting speculative theories
          regarding God....</p>
      <p>Among other views, they held that those once sanctiﬁed could not sin, and this they were presenting as gospel
          food. Their false theories, with their burden of deceptive inﬂuence, were working great harm to themselves and
          to others. They were gaining a spiritualistic power over those who could not see the evil of these beautifully
          clothed theories. Great evils had already resulted. The doctrine that all were holy had led to the belief that
          the affections of the sanctiﬁed were never in danger of leading astray. The result of this belief was the
          fulﬁllment of the evil desires of hearts which, though professedly sanctiﬁed, were far from purity of thought
          and practice.</p>
      <p>This is only one of the instances in which I was called upon to rebuke those who were presenting the doctrine
          of an impersonal god diffused through nature, and the doctrine of holy ﬂesh.</p>
      <p>In the future, truth will be counterfeited by the precepts of men. Deceptive theories will be presented as safe
          doctrines. False science is one of the agencies that Satan used in the heavenly courts, and it is used by him
          today....</p>
      <p>I beseech those who are laboring for God not to accept the spurious for the genuine. We have a whole Bible full
          of the most precious truth. We have no need for supposition or false excitement. In the golden censer of
          truth, as presented in Christ’s teachings, we have that which will convict and convert souls. Present in the
          simplicity of Christ the truths that He came to this world to proclaim, and the power of your message will
          make itself felt. Do not present theories or tests that have no foundation in the Bible.</p>
