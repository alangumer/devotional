    <h1>Chap. 125—False Theories About</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God Because that, when they knew God, they gloriﬁed him not as God, neither were thankful; but became
          vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Romans 1:21.</strong></p>
      <p>The theory that God is an essence pervading all nature, is one of Satan’s most subtle devices. It misrepresents
          God, and is a dishonor to His greatness and majesty.</p>
      <p>Pantheistic theories are not sustained by the Word of God. The light of His truth shows that these theories are
          <nobr>soul-destroying</nobr> agencies. Darkness is their element, sensuality their sphere. They gratify the
          natural heart, and give license to inclination. Separation from God is the result of accepting them....</p>
      <p>There is but one power that can break the hold of evil from the hearts of men, and that is the power of God in
          Jesus Christ. Only through the blood of the Cruciﬁed One is there cleansing from sin. His grace alone can
          enable us to resist and subdue the tendencies of our fallen nature. This power the spiritualistic theories
          concerning God make of no effect. If God is an essence pervading all nature, then He dwells in all men; and in
          order to attain holiness, man has only to develop the power that is within him.</p>
      <p>These theories, followed to their logical conclusion, sweep away the whole Christian economy. They do away with
          the necessity for the atonement, and make man his own savior. These theories regarding God make His Word of no
          effect, and those who accept them are in great danger of being led ﬁnally to look upon the whole Bible as a
          ﬁction. They may regard virtue as better than vice; but God being removed from His position of sovereignty,
          they place their dependence upon human power, which, without God, is worthless. The unaided human will has no
          real power to resist and overcome evil. The defenses of the soul are broken down. Man has no barrier against
          sin. When once the restraints of God’s Word and His Spirit are rejected, we know not to what depths one may
          sink.</p>
      <p>Those who continue to hold these spiritualistic theories will surely spoil their Christian experience, sever
          their connection with God, and lose eternal life.</p>
