    <h1>Chap. 18—A Better and Nobler Way</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
          learn to do well. Isaiah 1:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>Ignorance, pleasure loving, and sinful habits, corrupting soul, body, and spirit, make the world full of moral
          leprosy; a deadly moral malaria is destroying thousands and tens of thousands.</p>
      <p>Many are sunken in sin. Many are in distress. They are pressed with suffering, want, unbelief, despondency.
          Disease of every type afﬂicts them, both in body and in soul. They long to ﬁnd a solace for their troubles,
          and Satan tempts them to seek it in lusts and pleasures that lead to ruin and death. He is offering them the
          apples of Sodom, that will turn to ashes upon their lips.</p>
      <p>A terrible picture of the condition of the world has been presented before me. Immorality abounds everywhere.
          Licentiousness is the special sin of this age. Never did vice lift its deformed head with such boldness as
          now.... The iniquity which</p>
      <p>abounds is not merely conﬁned to the unbeliever and the scoffer. Would that this were the case, but it is not.
          Many men and women who profess the religion of Christ are guilty. Even some who profess to be looking for His
          appearing are no more prepared for that event than Satan himself. They are not cleansing themselves from all
          pollution. They have so long served their lust that it is natural for their thoughts to be impure and their
          imaginations corrupt. It is as impossible to cause their minds to dwell upon pure and holy things as it would
          be to turn the course of Niagara and send its waters pouring up the falls.... Every Christian will have
          to</p>
      <p>learn to restrain his passions and be controlled by principle....</p>
      <p>If lasciviousness, pollution, adultery, crime, and murder are the order of the day among those who know not the
          truth, and who refuse to be controlled by the principles of God’s word, how important that the class
          professing to be followers of Christ, closely allied to God and angels, should show them a better and nobler
          way! How important that by their chastity and virtue they stand in marked contrast to that class who are
          controlled by brute passions!</p>
