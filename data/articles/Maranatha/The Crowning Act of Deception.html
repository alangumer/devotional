    <h1>Chap. 268—The Crowning Act of Deception</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
          which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Revelation 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>As the second appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ draws near, satanic agencies are moved from beneath. Satan
          will not only appear as a human being, but he will personate Jesus Christ; and the world who has rejected the
          truth will receive him as the Lord of lords and King of kings.</p>
      <p>The wrath of Satan increases as his time grows short, and his work of deceit and destruction will reach its
          culmination in the time of trouble....</p>
      <p>As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan himself will personate Christ. The church has long
          professed to look to the Saviour’s advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver will make
          it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the earth, Satan will manifest himself among men as a
          majestic being of dazzling brightness, resembling the description of the Son of God given by John in the
          Revelation. Revelation <nobr>1:13-15.</nobr> The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that
          mortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out upon the air: “Christ has come! Christ has come!”
          The people prostrate themselves in adoration before him, while he lifts up his hands and pronounces a blessing
          upon them, as Christ blessed His disciples when He was upon the earth. His voice is soft and subdued, yet full
          of melody. In gentle, compassionate tones he presents some of the same gracious, heavenly truths which the
          Saviour uttered; he heals the diseases of the people, and then, in his assumed character of Christ, he claims
          to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday, and commands all to hallow the day which he has blessed. He declares
          that those who persist in keeping holy the seventh day are blaspheming his name by refusing to listen to his
          angels sent to them with light and truth. This is the strong, almost overmastering delusion. Like the
          Samaritans who were deceived by Simon Magus, the multitudes, from the least to the greatest, give heed to
          these sorceries, saying: This is “the great power of God.” Acts 8:10.</p>
      <p>But the people of God will not be misled. The teachings of this false Christ are not in accordance with the
          Scriptures.</p>
