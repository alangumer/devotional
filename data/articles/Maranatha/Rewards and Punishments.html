    <h1>Chap. 334—Rewards and Punishments</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
          prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Matthew 25:34.</strong></p>
      <p>The Saviour presents before us the scene of the last judgment when the reward is given to those upon His right
          hand, and the sentence of condemnation to those upon His left hand. The righteous are represented as wondering
          what they have done for which they are to be so liberally rewarded. They had had the abiding presence of
          Christ in their hearts; they had been imbued with His Spirit, and without conscious effort on their part; they
          had been serving Christ in the person of His saints, and had thereby gained the sure reward. But they had not
          had in view the reward they were to receive, and the expectation of it had been no part of the motive that had
          actuated their service. What they did was done from love to Christ and to their <nobr>fellow-men,</nobr> and
          Christ identiﬁes Himself with suffering humanity, and accounts that all deeds done in sympathy and compassion
          and love to men, are done to Him....</p>
      <p>In a subordinate sense we should all have respect unto the recompense of the reward. But while we appreciate
          the promise of blessing, we should have perfect conﬁdence in Jesus Christ, believing that He will do right,
          and give us reward according as our works have been. The gift of God is eternal life, but Jesus would have us
          not so anxious concerning rewards, as that we may do the will of God because it is right to do it,
          irrespective of all gain....</p>
      <p>Those who will receive the most abundant reward will be those who have mingled with their activity and zeal,
          gracious, tender pity for the poor, the orphan, the oppressed, and the afﬂicted.... There are about us those
          who have a meek and</p>
      <p>lowly spirit, the spirit of Christ, who do many little things to help those around them, and who think nothing
          of it; they will be astonished at last to ﬁnd that Christ has noticed the kind word spoken to the
          disheartened, and taken account of the smallest gift given for the relief of the poor, that cost the giver
          some <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> The Lord measures the spirit, and rewards accordingly, and the pure, humble,
          childlike spirit of love makes the offering precious in His sight.</p>
