    <h1>Chap. 298—The Earth Depopulated</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I
          beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no
          man, and all the birds of the heavens were ﬂed. Jeremiah <nobr>4:23-25.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face of the whole <nobr>earth—consumed</nobr> with the
          spirit of His mouth and destroyed by the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people to the City of God,
          and the earth is emptied of its inhabitants. “Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
          and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.” “The land shall be utterly
          emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.” “Because they have transgressed the laws,
          changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they
          that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned.” Isaiah 24:1, 3, 5,
          6.</p>
      <p>The whole earth appears like a desolate wilderness. The ruins of cities and villages destroyed by the
          earthquake, uprooted trees, ragged rocks thrown out by the sea or torn out of the earth itself, are scattered
          over its surface, while vast caverns mark the spot where the mountains have been rent from their
          foundations.</p>
      <p>Now the event takes place foreshadowed in the last solemn service of the Day of Atonement. When the
          ministration in the holy of holies had been completed, and the sins of Israel had been removed from the
          sanctuary by virtue of the blood of the sin offering, then the scapegoat was presented alive before the Lord;
          and in the presence of the congregation the high priest confessed over him “all the iniquities of the children
          of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.” Leviticus
          16:21. In like manner when the work of atonement in the heavenly sanctuary has been completed then in the
          presence of God and heavenly angels and the host of the redeemed the sins of God’s people will be placed upon
          Satan; he will be declared guilty of all the evil which he has caused them to commit.</p>
