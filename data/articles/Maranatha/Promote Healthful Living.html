    <h1>Chap. 111—Promote Healthful Living</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
          sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Romans 12:1.</strong></p>
      <p>It is impossible for a man to present his body a living sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable to God, while continuing to
          indulge habits that are depriving him of physical, mental, and moral vigor. Again the apostle says, “Be not
          conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
          good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” Romans 12:2.</p>
      <p>We are in a world that is opposed to righteousness or purity of character, and especially to growth in grace.
          Wherever we look, we see deﬁlement and corruption, deformity and sin. How opposed is all this to the work that
          must be accomplished in us just previous to receiving the gift of immortality! God’s elect must stand
          untainted amid the corruptions teeming around them in these last days. Their bodies must be made holy, their
          spirits pure. If this work is to be accomplished, it must be undertaken at once, earnestly and
          understandingly. The Spirit of God should have perfect control, inﬂuencing every action.</p>
      <p>The health reform is one branch of the great work which is to ﬁt a people for the coming of the Lord.... Men
          and women cannot violate natural law by indulging</p>
      <p>depraved appetites and lustful passions, without violating the law of God. Therefore He has permitted the light
          of health reform to shine upon us, that we may realize the sinfulness of breaking the laws which He has
          established in our very being....</p>
      <p>To make natural law plain, and to urge obedience to it, is a work that accompanies the third angel’s
          message.... He [God] designs that the subject</p>
      <p>shall be agitated, and the public mind deeply stirred to investigate it; for it is impossible for men and
          women, while under the power of sinful, <nobr>health-destroying,</nobr><nobr>brain-enervating</nobr> habits,
          to appreciate sacred truth....</p>
      <p>He who cherishes the light which God has given him upon health reform, has an important aid in the work of
          becoming sanctiﬁed through the truth, and ﬁtted for immortality.</p>
