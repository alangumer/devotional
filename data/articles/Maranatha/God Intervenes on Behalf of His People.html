    <h1>Chap. 254—God Intervenes on Behalf of His People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord God be witness against
          you, the Lord from his holy temple. For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come down,
          and tread upon the high places of the earth. Micah 1:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>It is in a crisis that character is revealed.... The great ﬁnal test comes at the close</p>
      <p>of human probation, when it will be too late for the soul’s need to be supplied. God keeps a reckoning with the
          nations. Through every century of this world’s</p>
      <p>history evil workers have been treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath; and when the time fully comes that
          iniquity shall have reached the stated boundary of God’s mercy, His forbearance will cease. When the
          accumulated ﬁgures in heaven’s record books shall mark the sum of transgression complete, wrath will come,
          unmixed with mercy, and then it will be seen what a tremendous thing it is to have worn out the divine
          patience. This crisis will be reached when the nations shall unite in making void God’s law.</p>
      <p>The days will come when the righteous will be stirred to zeal for God because of the abounding iniquity. None
          but divine power can stay the arrogance of Satan united with evil men; but in the hour of the church’s
          greatest danger most fervent prayer will be offered in her behalf by the faithful remnant, and God will hear
          and answer at the very time when the guilt of the transgressor has reached its height. He will “avenge his own
          elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them.</p>
      <p>The substitution of the false for the true is the last act in the drama. When this substitution becomes
          universal, God will reveal Himself. When the laws of men are exalted above the laws of God, when the powers of
          this earth try to force men to keep the ﬁrst day of the week, know that the time has come for God to work. He
          will arise in His majesty, and will shake terribly the earth. He will come out of His place to punish the
          inhabitants of the world for their iniquity. The earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her
          slain.</p>
