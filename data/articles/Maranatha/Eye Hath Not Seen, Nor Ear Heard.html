    <h1>Chap. 316—Eye Hath Not Seen, Nor Ear Heard</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
          prepared for them that love him. 1 Corinthians 2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who truly love God will desire so to improve the talents that He has given them, that they may be a
          blessing to others. And by and by the gates of heaven will be thrown wide open to admit them, and from the
          lips of the King of Glory the benediction will fall upon their ear like richest music, “Come, ye blessed of my
          Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Matthew 25:34). Thus the
          redeemed will be welcomed to the mansions that Jesus is preparing for them. There their companions will not be
          the vile of earth, but those who through divine aid have formed perfect characters. Every sinful tendency,
          every imperfection, has been removed by the blood of Christ; and the excellence and brightness of His glory,
          far exceeding the brightness of the sun in its meridian splendor, is imparted to them. And the moral beauty,
          the perfection of His character, shines through them in worth far exceeding this outward splendor. They are
          without fault before the great white throne, sharing the dignity and privileges of the angels.</p>
      <p>“Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
          prepared for them that love him.” In view of the glorious inheritance which may be his, “What shall a man give
          in exchange for his soul?” (Matthew 16:26). He may be poor; yet he possesses in himself a wealth and dignity
          that the world could never bestow. The soul, redeemed and cleansed from sin, with all its noble powers
          dedicated to the service of God, is of surpassing worth.</p>
      <p>To dwell forever in this home of the blest, to bear in soul, body, and spirit, not the dark traces of sin and
          curse, but the perfect likeness of our Creator, and through ceaseless ages to advance in wisdom, in knowledge,
          and in holiness, ever exploring new ﬁelds of thought, ever ﬁnding new wonders and new glories, ever increasing
          in capacity to know and to enjoy and to love, and knowing that there is still beyond us joy and love and
          wisdom <nobr>inﬁnite—such</nobr> is the object to which the Christian’s hope is pointing.</p>
