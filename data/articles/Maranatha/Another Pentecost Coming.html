    <h1>Chap. 248—Another Pentecost Coming!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come
          down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. Ezekiel 34:26.</strong></p>
      <p>Under the ﬁgure of the early and the latter rain, that falls in Eastern lands at seedtime and harvest, the
          Hebrew prophets foretold the bestowal of spiritual grace in extraordinary measure upon God’s church. The
          outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the beginning of the early, or former, rain, and
          glorious was the result.... But near the close of earth’s harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual</p>
      <p>grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is
          likened to the falling of the latter rain.</p>
      <p>The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its
          opening. The prophecies which were fulﬁlled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel
          are again to be fulﬁlled in the latter rain at its close....</p>
      <p>Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten from place to
          place to proclaim the message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be
          given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers.
          Satan also works with lying wonders, even bringing down ﬁre from heaven in the sight of men. Revelation 13:13.
          Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their stand.</p>
      <p>The message will be carried not so much by argument as by the deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The
          arguments have been presented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and bear fruit.... Now the
          rays of light</p>
      <p>penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever the bands which
          have held them. Family connections, church relations, are powerless to stay them now. Truth is more precious
          than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a large number take their stand
          upon the Lord’s side.</p>
