    <h1>Chap. 149—Watch Out for the Dividers!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! Luke
          17:1.</strong></p>
      <p>God is bringing out a people and preparing them to stand as one, united, to speak the same things, and carry
          out the prayer of Christ for his disciples.... “That they all</p>
      <p>may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us....”</p>
      <p>There are little companies continually arising who believe that God is only with the very few, the very
          scattered, and their inﬂuence is to tear down and scatter that which God’s servants build up.... The people
          who are putting forth every effort in</p>
      <p>accordance with God’s word to be one, who are established in the message of the third angel, they look upon
          with suspicion, for the reason that they are extending their labor, and are gathering souls into the truth.
          They look upon them as being worldly, because they have inﬂuence in the world....</p>
      <p>One man arises, claiming to be led of God, who advocates the heresy of the <nobr>non-resurrection</nobr> of the
          wicked.... Another cherishes erroneous views in regard to</p>
      <p>the future age.... They all want full religious liberty, and each one goes independent</p>
      <p>of the others, and yet claims that God is especially at work among them.... These</p>
      <p>people are not sane; they are carried away with a false excitement, and we know that they do not have the
          truth.... Would to God they would be reformed or give up</p>
      <p>the Sabbath. They would not then stand in the way of unbelievers....</p>
      <p>God is angry with those who pursue a course to make the world hate them. If a Christian is hated because of his
          good works, and for following Christ, he will have a reward. But if he is hated because he does not take a
          course to be loved, hated because of his uncultivated manners, and because he makes the truth a matter of
          quarrel with his neighbors, and because he has taken a course to make the Sabbath as annoying as possible to
          them, he is a <nobr>stumbling-block</nobr> to sinners, a reproach to the sacred truth, and unless he repents
          it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the sea.</p>
