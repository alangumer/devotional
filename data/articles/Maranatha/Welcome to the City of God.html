    <h1>Chap. 307—Welcome to the City of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few
          things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew
          25:23.</strong></p>
      <p>With unutterable love, Jesus welcomes His faithful ones to the joy of their Lord. The Saviour’s joy is in
          seeing, in the kingdom of glory, the souls that have been saved by His agony and humiliation. And the redeemed
          will be sharers in His joy, as they behold, among the blessed, those who have been won to Christ through their
          prayers, their labors, and their loving sacriﬁce. As they gather about the great white throne, gladness
          unspeakable will ﬁll their hearts, when they behold those whom they have won for Christ, and see that one has
          gained others, and these still others, all brought into the haven of rest, there to lay their crowns at Jesus’
          feet and praise Him through the endless cycles of eternity.</p>
      <p>As the ransomed ones are welcomed to the City of God, there rings out upon the air an exultant cry of
          adoration. The two Adams are about to meet. The Son of God is standing with outstretched arms to receive the
          father of our <nobr>race—the</nobr> being whom He created, who sinned against his Maker, and for whose sin the
          marks of the cruciﬁxion are borne upon the Saviour’s form. As Adam discerns the prints of the cruel nails, he
          does not fall upon the bosom of his Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying: “Worthy,
          worthy is the Lamb that was slain!” Tenderly the Saviour lifts him up and bids him look once more upon the
          Eden home from which he has so long been exiled.</p>
      <p>After his expulsion from Eden, Adam’s life on earth was ﬁlled with sorrow. Every dying leaf, every victim of
          sacriﬁce, every blight upon the fair face of nature, every stain upon man’s purity, was a fresh reminder of
          his sin.... With</p>
      <p>patient humility he bore, for nearly a thousand years, the penalty of transgression. Faithfully did he repent
          of his sin and trust in the merits of the promised Saviour, and he died in the hope of a resurrection. The Son
          of God redeemed man’s failure and fall; and now, through the work of the atonement, Adam is reinstated in his
          ﬁrst dominion.</p>
