      <p><strong>Sabbathkeepers</strong></p>
      <p>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as
          doves. Matthew 10:16.</p>
      <p>When the practices of the people do not come in conﬂict with the law of God, you may conform to them. If the
          workers fail to do this, they will not only hinder their own work, but they will place stumbling blocks in the
          way of those for whom they labor, and hinder them from accepting the truth. On Sunday there is the very best
          opportunity for those who are missionaries to hold Sunday schools, and come to the people in the simplest
          manner possible, telling them of the love of Jesus for sinners, and educating them in the Scriptures....</p>
      <p>At present <nobr>Sunday-keeping</nobr> is not the test. The time will come when men will not only forbid Sunday
          work, but they will try to force men to labor on the Sabbath, and to subscribe to Sunday observance or forfeit
          their freedom and their lives. But the time for this has not yet come, for the truth must be presented more
          fully before the people as a witness....</p>
      <p>The light that I have is that God’s servants should go quietly to work, preaching the grand, precious truths of
          the <nobr>Bible—Christ</nobr> and Him cruciﬁed. His love and inﬁnite <nobr>sacriﬁce—showing</nobr> that the
          reason why Christ died is because the law of God is immutable, unchangeable, eternal. The Sabbath must be
          taught in a decided manner, but be cautious how you deal with the idol Sunday. A word to the wise is
          sufﬁcient....</p>
      <p>Refraining from work on Sunday is not receiving the mark of the beast; and where this will advance the
          interests of the work, it should be done. We should not go out of our way to work on Sunday....</p>
      <p>When those who hear and see the light on the Sabbath take their stand upon the truth to keep God’s holy day,
          difﬁculties will arise; for efforts will be brought to bear against them to compel men and women to transgress
          the law of God. Here they must stand ﬁrm, that they will not violate the law of God; and if the opposition and
          persecution are determinedly kept up, let them heed the words of Christ: “When they persecute you in this
          city, ﬂee ye into another.</p>
