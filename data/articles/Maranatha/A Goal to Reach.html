    <h1>Chap. 54—A Goal to Reach</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be
          preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thessalonians 5:23.</strong></p>
      <p>When Paul wrote, “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly,” he did not exhort his brethren to aim at a
          standard which it was impossible for them to reach; he did not pray that they might have blessings which it
          was not the will of God to give. He knew that all who would be ﬁtted to meet Christ in peace, must possess a
          pure and holy character.</p>
      <p>If <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists practiced what they profess to believe, if they were sincere health
          reformers, they would indeed be a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. And they would show a far
          greater zeal for the salvation of those who are ignorant of the truth.</p>
      <p>Greater reforms should be seen among the people who claim to be looking for the soon appearing of Christ.
          Health reform is to do among our people a work which it has not yet done. There are those who ought to be
          awake to the danger of <nobr>meat-eating,</nobr> who are still eating the ﬂesh of animals, thus endangering
          the physical, mental, and spiritual health. Many who are now only half converted on the question of
          <nobr>meat-eating</nobr> will go from God’s people, to walk no more with them.</p>
      <p>The controlling power of appetite will prove the ruin of thousands, when, if they had conquered on this point,
          they would have had moral power to gain the victory over every other temptation of Satan. But those who are
          slaves to appetite will fail in perfecting Christian character. The continual transgression of man for six
          thousand years has brought sickness, pain, and death as its fruits. And as we near the close of time, Satan’s
          temptation to indulge appetite will be more powerful and more difﬁcult to overcome.</p>
      <p>Again and again I have been shown that God is trying to lead us back, step by step, to His original
          <nobr>design—that</nobr> man should subsist upon the natural products of the earth. Among those who are
          waiting for the coming of the Lord, <nobr>meat-eating</nobr> will eventually be done away; ﬂesh will cease to
          form a part of their diet. We should ever keep this end in view, and endeavor to work steadily toward it.</p>
