    <h1>Chap. 166—Armed Conﬂict in the Last Days</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind
          shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. Jeremiah 25:32.</strong></p>
      <p>Soon grievous troubles will rise among the <nobr>nations—trouble</nobr> that will not cease until Jesus comes.
          As never before we need to press together, serving Him who has prepared His throne in the heavens and whose
          kingdom ruleth over all. God has not forsaken His people, and our strength lies in not forsaking Him.</p>
      <p>The judgments of God are in the land. The wars and rumors of wars, the destruction by ﬁre and ﬂood, say clearly
          that the time of trouble, which is to increase until the end, is very near at hand. We have no time to lose.
          The world is stirred with the spirit of war. The prophecies of the eleventh of Daniel have almost reached
          their ﬁnal fulﬁllment.</p>
      <p>Soon strife among the nations will break out with an intensity that we do not now anticipate. The present is a
          time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and
          authority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention ﬁxed upon the events taking place about
          us. They are watching the strained, restless relations that exist among the nations. They observe the
          intensity that is taking possession of every earthly element, and they realize that something great and
          decisive is about to take place, that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.</p>
      <p>A moment of respite has been graciously given us of God. Every power lent us of Heaven is now to be used in
          working for those perishing in ignorance. There must be no delay. The truth must be proclaimed in the dark
          places of the earth.... A</p>
      <p>great work is to be done, and to those who know the truth for this time, this work has been entrusted.</p>
      <p>In the last scenes of this earth’s history, war will rage. There will be pestilence, plague, and famine. The
          waters of the deep will overﬂow their boundaries. Property and life will be destroyed by ﬁre and ﬂood. We
          should be preparing for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for them that love Him. There is a rest
          from earth’s conﬂict.</p>
