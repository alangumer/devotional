    <h1>Chap. 219—Perfection in the Human Sphere</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:48.</strong></p>
      <p>Our Saviour understood all about human nature, and He says to every human being. “Be ye therefore perfect, even
          as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” As God is perfect in His sphere, so man is to be perfect in his
          sphere. Those who receive Christ are among the number to whom the words so full of hope are spoken. “As many
          as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.”
          These words declare to us that we should be content with nothing less than the best and highest character, a
          character formed after the divine similitude. When such a character is possessed, the life, the faith, the
          purity of the religion, is an instructive example to others.</p>
      <p>But those who are waiting to behold a magical change in their characters without determined effort on their
          part to overcome sin, will be disappointed. We have no reason to fear while looking to Jesus, no reason to
          doubt but that He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto Him; but we may constantly fear lest our
          old nature will again obtain the supremacy, that the enemy shall devise some snare whereby we shall again
          become his captives. We are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh
          in you to will and to do of His good pleasure. With our limited powers we are to be as holy in our sphere as
          God is holy in His sphere. To the extent of our ability, we are to make manifest the truth and love and
          excellence of the divine character. As wax takes the impression of the seal, so the soul is to take the
          impression of the Spirit of God and retain the image of Christ.</p>
      <p>We are to grow daily in spiritual loveliness. We shall fail often in our efforts to copy the divine pattern. We
          shall often have to bow down to weep at the feet of Jesus, because of our shortcomings and mistakes; but we
          are not to be discouraged; we are to pray more fervently, believe more fully, and try again with more
          steadfastness to grow into the likeness of our Lord. As we distrust our own power, we shall trust the power of
          our Redeemer, and render praise to God, who is the health of our countenance, and our God.</p>
