    <h1>Chap. 228—Salvation Day by Day</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 1 Corinthians 10:12. Peter’s fall was not
          instantaneous, but gradual. <nobr>Self-conﬁdence</nobr> led him to the</strong></p>
      <p>belief that he was saved, and step after step was taken in the downward path, until he could deny his Master.
          Never can we safely put conﬁdence in self or feel, this side of heaven, that we are secure against temptation.
          Those who accept the Saviour, however sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or to feel that
          they are saved. This is misleading. Every one should be taught to cherish hope and faith; but even when we
          give ourselves to Christ and know that He accepts us, we are not beyond the reach of temptation.... Only he
          who endures the trial will receive the</p>
      <p>crown of life (James 1:12).</p>
      <p>Those who accept Christ, and in their ﬁrst conﬁdence say, I am saved, are in danger of trusting to
          themselves.... We are admonished, “Let him that thinketh he</p>
      <p>standeth take heed lest he fall” (1 Corinthians 10:12). Our only safety is in constant distrust of self, and
          dependence on Christ.</p>
      <p>There are many who profess Christ, but who never become mature Christians. They admit that man is fallen, that
          his faculties are weakened, that he is unﬁtted for moral achievement, but they say that Christ has borne all
          the burden, all the suffering, all the <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and they are willing to let Him bear it. They
          say that there is nothing for them to do but to believe; but Christ said, “If any man will come after me, let
          him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24)....</p>
      <p>We are never to rest in a satisﬁed condition, and cease to make advancement, saying, “I am saved.” When this
          idea is entertained, the motives for watchfulness, for prayer, for earnest endeavor to press onward to higher
          attainments, cease to exist. No sanctiﬁed tongue will be found uttering these words till Christ shall come,
          and we enter in through the gates into the city of God. Then, with the utmost propriety, we may give glory to
          God and to the Lamb for eternal deliverance.</p>
