    <h1>Chap. 196—The Puriﬁcation of the Church</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he shall sit as a reﬁner and puriﬁer of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge
          them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Malachi
          3:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The time is upon us when the <nobr>miracle-working</nobr> power of the archdeceiver will be more decidedly
          revealed. And his deceptions will increase in their delusive attraction, so that they will perplex, and if
          possible, deceive, the very elect. The prince of darkness with his evil angels is working upon the Christian
          world, inducing those who profess the name of Christ to stand under the banner of darkness, to make war with
          those who keep the commandments of God, and have the faith of Jesus.</p>
      <p>An apostate church will unite with the powers of earth and hell to place upon the forehead or in the hand, the
          mark of the beast, and prevail upon the children of God to worship the beast and his image. They will seek to
          compel them to renounce their allegiance to God’s law, and yield homage to the papacy. Then will come the
          times which will try men’s souls; for the confederacy of apostasy will demand that the loyal subjects of God
          shall renounce the law of Jehovah, and repudiate the truth of His word. Then will the gold be separated from
          the dross, and it will be made apparent who are the godly, who are the loyal and true, and who are the
          disloyal, the dross and the tinsel. What clouds of chaff will then be borne away by the fan of God! Where now
          our eyes can discover only rich ﬂoors of wheat, will be chaff blown away with the fan of God. Every one who is
          not centered in Christ will fail to stand the test and ordeal of that day. While those who are clothed with
          Christ’s righteousness will stand ﬁrm to truth and duty, those who have trusted in their own righteousness
          will be ranged under the black banner of the prince of darkness. Then it will be seen whether the choice is
          for Christ or Belial.</p>
      <p>Those who have been <nobr>self-distrustful,</nobr> who have been so circumstanced that they have not dared to
          face stigma and reproach, will at last openly declare themselves for Christ and His law; while many who have
          appeared to be ﬂourishing trees, but who have borne no fruit, will go with the multitude to do evil, and will
          receive the mark of apostasy in the forehead or in the hand.</p>
