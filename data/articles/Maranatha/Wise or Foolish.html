    <h1>Chap. 46—Wise or Foolish?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to
          meet the bridegroom. And ﬁve of them were wise, and ﬁve were foolish. Matthew 25:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>We are not to rest in the idea that because we are <nobr>church-members</nobr> we are saved, while we give no
          evidence that we are conformed to the image of Christ, while we cling to our old habits, and weave our fabric
          with the threads of worldly ideas and customs....</p>
      <p>The ten virgins are watching in the evening of this earth’s history. All claim to be Christians. All have a
          call, a name, a lamp, and all claim to be doing God’s service. All apparently watch for His appearing. But ﬁve
          are wanting. Five will be found surprised, dismayed, outside the banquet hall.</p>
      <p>We are represented either by the wise or by the foolish virgins. There are many who will not remain at the feet
          of Jesus, and learn of Him. They have not a knowledge of His ways; they are not prepared for His coming. They
          have made a pretense of waiting for their Lord. They have not watched and prayed with that faith which works
          by love and puriﬁes the soul. They have lived a life of carelessness. They have heard and assented to the
          truth, but they have never brought it into their practical life. The oil of grace is not feeding their lamps,
          and they are not prepared to enter into the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>
      <p>Be not like the foolish virgins, who take for granted that the promises of God are theirs, while they do not
          follow the injunctions of Christ. Christ teaches us that profession is nothing. “If any man will come after
          me,” He says, “let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” ...</p>
      <p>When we stand the test of God in the reﬁning, purifying process; when the furnace ﬁre consumes the dross, and
          the true gold of a puriﬁed character appears, we may still say, with Paul, “Not as though I had already
          attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after.... This one thing I do, forgetting those things
          which are</p>
      <p>behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the
          high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”</p>
