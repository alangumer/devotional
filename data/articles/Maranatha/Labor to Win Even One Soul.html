    <h1>Chap. 21—Labor to Win Even One Soul</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in
          the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he ﬁnd it? Luke 15:4.</strong></p>
      <p>For the conversion of one soul we should tax our resources to the utmost. One soul won to Christ will ﬂash
          heaven’s light all around him, penetrating the moral darkness and saving other souls.</p>
      <p>If Christ left the ninety and nine, that He might seek and save the one lost sheep, can we be justiﬁed in doing
          less? Is not a neglect to work even as Christ worked, to sacriﬁce as He sacriﬁced, a betrayal of sacred
          trusts, an insult to God?</p>
      <p>Sound an alarm throughout the length and breadth of the earth. Tell the people that the day of the Lord is near
          and hasteth greatly. Let none be left unwarned. We might have been in the place of the poor souls that are in
          error. We might have been placed among barbarians. According to the truth we have received above others, we
          are debtors to impart the same to them.</p>
      <p>We have no time to lose. The end is near. The passage from place to place to spread the truth will soon be
          hedged with dangers on the right hand and on the left. Everything will be placed to obstruct the way of the
          Lord’s messengers, so that they will not be able to do that which it is possible for them to do now. We must
          look our work fairly in the face and advance as fast as possible in aggressive warfare. From the light given
          me of God I know that the powers of darkness are working with intense energy from beneath, and with stealthy
          tread Satan is advancing to take those who are now asleep, as a wolf taking his prey. We have warnings now
          which we may give, a work now which we may do; but soon it will be more difﬁcult than we can imagine. God help
          us to keep in the channel of light, to work with our eyes fastened on Jesus our Leader, and patiently,
          perseveringly press on to gain the victory.</p>
      <p>In our life here, earthly, <nobr>sin-restricted</nobr> though it is, the greatest joy and the highest education
          are in service. And in the future state, untrammeled by the limitations of sinful humanity, it is in service
          that our greatest joy and our highest education will be found.</p>
