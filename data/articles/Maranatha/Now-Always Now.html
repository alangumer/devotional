    <h1>Chap. 47—Now—Always Now</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. Matthew
          25:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The coming of Christ will be as it were at midnight, when all are sleeping. It will be well for every one to
          have his accounts all straightened up before sunset. All his works should be right, all his dealings just,
          between himself and his <nobr>fellow-men.</nobr> All dishonesty, all sinful practices should be put far away.
          The oil of grace should be in our vessels with our lamps.... Sad indeed will be the condition of the soul
          who</p>
      <p>has had a form of godliness but has denied the power thereof; who has called Christ, Lord, Lord, and yet who
          has not His image and superscription....</p>
      <p>God graciously grants a day of probation, a time of test and trial. He gives the invitation: “Seek ye the Lord
          while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.” ...</p>
      <p>Today the voice of mercy is calling, and Jesus is drawing men by the cords of His love; but the day will come
          when Jesus will put on the garments of vengeance.... The</p>
      <p>wickedness of the world is increasing every day, and when a certain line is reached, the register will be
          closed, and the account settled. There will be no more a sacriﬁce for sin. The Lord cometh. Long has mercy
          extended a hand of love, of patience and forbearance, toward a guilty world. The invitation has been given,
          “Let him take hold of my strength....” But men have presumed upon His mercy and refused His</p>
      <p>grace.</p>
      <p>Why has the Lord so long delayed His coming? The whole host of heaven is waiting to fulﬁl the last work for
          this lost world, and yet the work waits. It is because the few who profess to have the oil of grace in their
          vessels with their lamps, have not become burning and shining lights in the world. It is because missionaries
          are few....</p>
      <p>Every week counts one week less, every day one day nearer to the appointed time of the judgment. Alas that so
          many have only a spasmodic <nobr>religion—a</nobr> religion dependent upon feeling and governed by emotion.
          “He that endureth to the end shall be saved.” Then see that you have the oil of grace in your hearts. The
          possession of this will make every difference with you in the judgment.</p>
