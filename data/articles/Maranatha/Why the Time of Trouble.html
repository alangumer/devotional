    <h1>Chap. 265—Why the Time of Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1. Though God’s people will be
          surrounded by enemies who are bent upon their</strong></p>
      <p>destruction, yet the anguish which they suffer is not a dread of persecution for the truth’s sake; they fear
          that every sin has not been repented of, and that through some fault in themselves they will fail to realize
          the fulﬁllment of the Saviour’s promise: I “will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon
          all the world.” Revelation 3:10. If they could have the assurance of pardon they would not shrink from torture
          or death; but should they prove unworthy, and lose their lives because of their own defects of character, then
          God’s holy name would be reproached.</p>
      <p>On every hand they hear the plottings of treason and see the active working of rebellion; and there is aroused
          within them an intense desire, an earnest yearning of soul, that this great apostasy may be terminated and the
          wickedness of the wicked may come to an end. But while they plead with God to stay the work of rebellion, it
          is with a keen sense of <nobr>self-reproach</nobr> that they themselves have no more power to resist and urge
          back the mighty tide of evil. They feel that had they always employed all their ability in the service of
          Christ, going forward from strength to strength, Satan’s forces would have less power to prevail against
          them.</p>
      <p>They afﬂict their souls before God, pointing to their past repentance of their many sins, and pleading the
          Saviour’s promise: “Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace
          with me.” Isaiah 27:5. Their faith does not fail because their prayers are not immediately answered. Though
          suffering the keenest anxiety, terror, and distress, they do not cease their intercessions. They lay hold of
          the strength of God as Jacob laid hold of the Angel; and the language of their souls is: “I will not let thee
          go, except thou bless me.”</p>
      <p>The time of trouble is the crucible that is to bring out Christlike characters. It is designed to lead the
          people of God to renounce Satan and his temptations.</p>
