    <h1>Chap. 266—God’s Eye is Upon His People Shall not</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you
          that he will avenge them speedily. Luke 18:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>In the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with
          fear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith, and they could not have
          conﬁdence to plead with God for deliverance. But while they have a deep sense of their unworthiness, they have
          no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to judgment and have been blotted out, and they
          cannot bring them to remembrance....</p>
      <p>Those professed Christians who come up to that last fearful conﬂict unprepared will, in their despair, confess
          their sins in words of burning anguish, while the wicked exult over their distress....</p>
      <p>Jacob’s history is also an assurance that God will not cast off those who have been deceived and tempted and
          betrayed into sin, but who have returned unto Him with true repentance. While Satan seeks to destroy this
          class, God will send His angels to comfort and protect them in the time of peril. The assaults of Satan are
          ﬁerce and determined, his delusions are terrible; but the Lord’s eye is upon His people, and His ear listens
          to their cries. Their afﬂiction is great, the ﬂames of the furnace seem about to consume them; but the Reﬁner
          will bring them forth as gold tried in the ﬁre. God’s love for His children during the period of their
          severest trial is as strong and tender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful for them
          to be placed in the furnace of ﬁre; their earthliness must be consumed, that the image of Christ may be
          perfectly reﬂected.</p>
      <p>The season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that can endure weariness, delay, and
          <nobr>hunger—a</nobr> faith that will not faint though severely tried. The period of probation is granted to
          all to prepare for that time.... All who will lay hold</p>
      <p>of God’s promises, as he [Jacob] did, and be as earnest and persevering as he was, will succeed as he
          succeeded.</p>
