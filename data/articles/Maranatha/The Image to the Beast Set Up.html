    <h1>Chap. 156—The Image to the Beast Set Up</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>[He] deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in
          the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast.
          Revelation 13:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The image of the beast will be formed before probation closes; for it is to be the great test for the people of
          God, by which their eternal destiny will be decided....</p>
      <p>In Revelation 13 this subject is plainly presented: “I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
          had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the ﬁrst beast before
          him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the ﬁrst beast, whose deadly wound was
          healed.” Then the <nobr>miracle-working</nobr> power is revealed: “And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
          by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell
          on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And
          he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and
          cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both
          small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
          And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his
          name.”</p>
      <p>This is the test that the people of God must have before they are sealed. All who prove their loyalty to God by
          observing His law, and refusing to accept a spurious sabbath, will rank under the banner of the Lord God
          Jehovah, and will receive the seal of the living God. Those who yield the truth of heavenly origin, and accept
          the Sunday sabbath, will receive the mark of the beast....</p>
      <p>While John was shown the last great struggles of the church with earthly powers, he was also permitted to
          behold the ﬁnal victory and deliverance of the faithful....</p>
      <p>Looking beyond the smoke and din of the battle, he beheld a company upon Mount Zion with the Lamb, having,
          instead of the mark of the beast, the “Father’s name written in their foreheads.”</p>
