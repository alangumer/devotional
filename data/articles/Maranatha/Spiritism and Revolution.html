    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ... and thy neighbour as
          thyself. Luke 10:27.</strong></p>
      <p>As the youth go out into the world to encounter its allurements to <nobr>sin—the</nobr> passion for money
          getting, for amusement and indulgence, for display, luxury, and extravagance, the overreaching, fraud,
          robbery, and <nobr>ruin—what</nobr> are the teachings there to be met?</p>
      <p>Spiritualism asserts that men are unfallen demigods; that “each mind will judge itself”; that “true knowledge
          places men above all law”; that “all sins committed are innocent”; for “whatever is, is right,” and “God doth
          not condemn.” The basest of human beings it represents as in heaven, and highly exalted there. Thus it
          declares to all men, “It matters not what you do; live as you please, heaven is your home.” Multitudes are
          thus led to believe that desire is the highest law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable only
          to himself.</p>
      <p>With such teaching given at the very outset of life, when impulse is strongest, and the demand for
          <nobr>self-restraint</nobr> and purity is most urgent, where are the safeguards of virtue? what is to prevent
          the world from becoming a second Sodom?</p>
      <p>All the same time anarchy is seeking to sweep away all law, not only divine, but human. The centralizing of
          wealth and power; the vast combinations for the enriching of the few at the expense of the many; the
          combinations of the poorer classes for the defense of their interests and claims; ... the
          <nobr>world-wide</nobr> dissemination of the same teachings that led to the French <nobr>Revolution—all</nobr>
          are tending to involve the whole world in a struggle similar to that which convulsed France.</p>
      <p>Such are the inﬂuences to be met by the youth of today. To stand amidst such upheavals they are now to lay the
          foundations of character.</p>
      <p>In every generation and in every land the true foundation and pattern for character building have been the
          same. The divine law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ... and thy neighbour as thyself”
          (Luke 10:27), the great principle made manifest in the character and life of our Saviour, is the only secure
          foundation and the only sure guide.</p>
