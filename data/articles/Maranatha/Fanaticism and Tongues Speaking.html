    <h1>Chap. 146—Fanaticism and Tongues Speaking</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of
          peace, as in all churches of the saints. 1 Corinthians 14:32, 33.</strong></p>
      <p>A spirit of fanaticism has ruled a certain class of Sabbathkeepers.... They have</p>
      <p>sipped but lightly at the fountain of truth and are unacquainted with the spirit of the message of the third
          angel. Nothing can be done for this class until their fanatical views are corrected....</p>
      <p>Some of these persons have exercises which they call gifts and say that the Lord has placed them in the church.
          They have an unmeaning gibberish which they call the unknown tongue, which is unknown not only by man but by
          the Lord and all heaven. Such gifts are manufactured by men and women, aided by the great deceiver.
          Fanaticism, false excitement, false talking in tongues, and noisy exercises have been considered gifts which
          God has placed in the Church. Some have been deceived here. The fruits of all this have not been good....</p>
      <p>There are many restless spirits who will not submit to discipline, system, and order. They think that their
          liberties would be abridged were they to lay aside their own judgment and submit to the judgment of those of
          experience. The work of God will not progress unless there is a disposition to submit to order and expel the
          reckless, disorderly spirit of fanaticism from their meetings. Impressions and feelings are no sure evidence
          that a person is led by the Lord. Satan will, if he is unsuspected, give feelings and impressions. These are
          not safe guides. All should thoroughly acquaint themselves with the evidences of our faith, and the great
          study should be how they can adorn their profession and bear fruit to the glory of God....</p>
      <p>A triﬂing, joking, reckless spirit should be rebuked. It is no evidence of the grace of God upon the heart for
          persons to talk and pray with talent in meeting, and then give up to a rough, careless manner of talking and
          acting when out of meeting....</p>
      <p>The truth of God will never degrade, but will elevate the receiver, reﬁne his taste, sanctify his judgment, and
          perfect him for the company of the pure and holy angels in the kingdom of God.</p>
