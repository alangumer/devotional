      <p><strong>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 2 Corinthians
          11:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan is preparing his deceptions that in his last campaign against the people of God, they may not understand
          that it is he. “And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” ... Satan will go to
          the extent of his power to harass, tempt, and mislead God’s people.</p>
      <p>He who dared to face, and tempt, and taunt our Lord, and who had power to take Him in his arms and carry Him to
          a pinnacle of the temple, and up into an exceeding high mountain, will exercise his power to a wonderful
          degree upon the present generation, who are far inferior in wisdom to their Lord, and who are almost wholly
          ignorant of his subtlety and strength.</p>
      <p>In a marvelous manner will he affect the bodies of those who are naturally inclined to do his bidding.</p>
      <p>He will come personating Jesus Christ, working mighty miracles; and men will fall down and worship him as Jesus
          Christ.</p>
      <p>We shall be commanded to worship this being, whom the world will glorify as Christ. What shall we
          <nobr>do?—Tell</nobr> them that Christ has warned us against just such a foe, who is man’s worst enemy, yet
          who claims to be God; and that when Christ shall make His appearance, it will be with power and great glory,
          accompanied by ten thousand times ten thousand angels and thousands of thousands; and that when He shall come,
          we shall know His voice.</p>
      <p>The time is coming when Satan will work miracles right in your sight, claiming that he is Christ; and if your
          feet are not ﬁrmly established upon the truth of God, then you will be led away from your foundation.</p>
      <p>Satan is determined to keep up the warfare to the end. Coming as an angel of light, claiming to be the Christ,
          he will deceive the world. But his triumph will be short. No storm or tempest can move those whose feet are
          planted on the principles of eternal truth. They will be able to stand in this time of almost universal
          apostasy.</p>

          written.” This is the only foundation upon which they can stand securely.</p>
