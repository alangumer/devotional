    <h1>Chap. 177—Relief of Physical Suffering</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
          raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. Matthew 10:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>Perilous times are before us. The whole world will be involved in perplexity and distress, disease of every
          kind will be upon the human family, and such ignorance as now prevails concerning the laws of health would
          result in great suffering and the loss of many lives that might be saved....</p>
      <p>As religious aggression subverts the liberties of our nation, those who would stand for freedom of conscience
          will be placed in unfavorable positions. For their own sake, they should, while they have opportunity, become
          intelligent in regard to disease, its causes, prevention, and cure. And those who do this will ﬁnd a ﬁeld of
          labor anywhere. There will be suffering ones, plenty of them, who will need help, not only among those of our
          own faith, but largely among those who know not the truth.</p>
      <p>The medical work done in connection with the giving of the third angel’s message, is to accomplish wonderful
          results. It is to be a sanctifying, unifying work, corresponding to the work which the great Head of the
          church sent forth the ﬁrst disciples to do.</p>
      <p>Calling these disciples together, Christ gave them their commission: ... “And as ye go, preach, saying, The
          kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye
          have received, freely give.” “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise
          as serpents, and harmless as doves.” Matthew 10:7, 8, 16.</p>
      <p>It is well for us to read this chapter and let its instruction prepare us for our labors. The early disciples
          were going forth on Christ’s errands, under His commission. His spirit was to prepare the way before them.
          They were to feel that with such a message to give, such blessings to impart, they should receive a welcome in
          the homes of the people.</p>
      <p>God reaches hearts through the relief of physical suffering. A seed of truth is dropped into the mind, and is
          watered by God. Much patience may be required before this seed shows signs of life, but at last it springs up,
          and bears fruit unto eternal life.</p>
      <p>How slow men are to understand God’s preparation for the day of His power!</p>
