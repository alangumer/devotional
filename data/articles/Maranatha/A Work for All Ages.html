    <h1>Chap. 114—A Work for All Ages</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men,
          because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 1 John 2:14,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many lines in which the youth can ﬁnd opportunity for helpful effort....</p>
      <p>In this closing work of the gospel there is a vast ﬁeld to be occupied; and, more than ever before, the work is
          to enlist helpers from the common people. Both the youth and those older in years will be called from the
          ﬁeld, from the vineyard, and from the workshop, and sent forth by the Master to give His message. Many of
          these may have had little opportunity for education, but Christ sees in them qualiﬁcations that will enable
          them to fulﬁll His purpose. If they put their hearts into the work and continue to be learners, He will ﬁt
          them to labor for Him....</p>
      <p>However large, however small, your talents, remember that what you have is yours only in trust. Thus God is
          testing you, giving you an opportunity to prove yourself true. To Him you are indebted for all your
          capabilities. To Him belong your powers of body, mind, and soul, and for Him these powers are to be used. Your
          time, your inﬂuence, your capabilities, your <nobr>skill—all</nobr> must be accounted for to Him who gives
          all.</p>
      <p>The youth who ﬁnds joy and happiness in reading the word of God and in the hour of prayer is constantly
          refreshed by drafts from the Fountain of life. He will attain a height of moral excellence and a breadth of
          thought of which others cannot conceive.... Those who thus connect their souls with God are acknowledged by
          Him</p>
      <p>as His sons and daughters. They are constantly reaching higher and still higher, obtaining clearer views of God
          and of eternity, until the Lord makes them channels of light and wisdom to the world.</p>
      <p>With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a cruciﬁed,
          risen, and <nobr>soon-coming</nobr> Saviour might be carried to the whole world! How soon might the end
          <nobr>come—the</nobr> end of suffering and sorrow and sin!</p>
