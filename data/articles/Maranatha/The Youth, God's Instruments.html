    <h1>Chap. 113—The Youth, God’s Instruments</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. Lamentations 3:27. God calls young men in the
          vigor and strength of their youth to share with Him</strong></p>
      <p><nobr>self-denial,</nobr> sacriﬁce, and suffering. If they accept the call, He will make them His instruments
          to save souls for whom He died. But He would have them count the cost and enter upon their work with a full
          knowledge of the conditions upon which they serve a cruciﬁed Redeemer....</p>
      <p>Our ﬁrst work should be to bring our own hearts into harmony with God, and then we are prepared to labor for
          others. In former days there was great searching of heart among our earnest workers. They counseled together
          and united in humble, fervent prayer for divine guidance.... Christ’s coming is nearer than when we</p>
      <p>believed. Every passing day leaves us one less to proclaim the message of warning to the world. Would that
          there were today more earnest intercession with God, greater humility, greater purity, and greater faith.</p>
      <p>We have a grand work to do for the Master, to open the word of God to those who are in the darkness of error.
          Young friends, act as though you had a sacred charge. You should be Bible students, ever ready to give to
          every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you. By your true Christian dignity give evidence
          that you know you have a truth that it is for the interest of the people to hear. If this truth is inwrought
          in the soul, it will manifest itself in the countenance and demeanor, in a calm, noble
          <nobr>self-possession</nobr> and peace which the Christian alone can possess. Those who have genuine humility,
          and whose minds have been expanded by the truths unfolded in the gospel, will have an inﬂuence that will be
          felt. They will make an impression upon minds and hearts.</p>
      <p>I have no higher wish than to see our youth imbued with the spirit of pure religion which will lead them to
          take up the cross and follow Jesus. Go forth, young disciples of Christ, controlled by principle, clad in the
          robes of purity and righteousness. Your Saviour will guide you into the position best suited to your talents
          and where you can be most useful. In the path of duty you may be sure of receiving grace sufﬁcient for your
          day.</p>
