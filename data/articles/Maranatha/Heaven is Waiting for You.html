      <p><strong>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. John 20:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Of the apostles it is written, “They went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and
          conﬁrming the word with signs following.” Mark 16:20. As Christ sent forth His disciples, so today He sends
          forth the members of His church. The same power that the apostles had is for them. If they will make God their
          strength, He will work with them, and they shall not labor in vain. Let them realize that the work in which
          they are engaged is one upon which the Lord has placed His signet. God said to Jeremiah, “Say not, I am a
          child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not
          afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee.” Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched His
          servant’s mouth, saying, “Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.” Jeremiah <nobr>1:7-9.</nobr> And He bids
          us go forth to speak the words He gives us, feeling His holy touch upon our lips.</p>
      <p>Christ has given to the church a sacred charge. Every member should be a channel through which God can
          communicate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ. There is nothing that
          the Saviour desires so much as agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and His character. There is
          nothing that the world needs so much as the manifestation through humanity of the Saviour’s love. All heaven
          is waiting for men and women through whom God can reveal the power of Christianity.</p>
      <p>The church is God’s agency for the proclamation of truth, empowered by Him to do a special work; and if she is
          loyal to Him, obedient to all His commandments, there will dwell within her the excellency of divine grace. If
          she will be true to her allegiance, if she will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is no power that can stand
          against her.</p>
      <p>Zeal for God and His cause moved the disciples to bear witness to the gospel with mighty power. Should not a
          like zeal ﬁre our hearts with a determination to tell the story of redeeming love, of Christ and Him cruciﬁed?
          It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten the coming of the Saviour.</p>
