    <h1>Chap. 162—The Sabbath Proclaimed More Fully</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I saw another angel ﬂy in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that
          dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear
          God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth,
          and the sea, and the fountains of waters. Revelation 14:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>At the commencement of the time of trouble, we were ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost as we went forth and proclaimed
          the Sabbath more fully.</p>
      <p>“The commencement of that time of trouble,” here mentioned, does not refer to the time when the plagues shall
          begin to be poured out, but to a short period just before they are poured out, while Christ is in the
          sanctuary. At that time, while the work of salvation is closing, trouble will be coming on the earth, and the
          nations will be angry, yet held in check so as not to prevent the work of the third angel. At that time the
          “latter rain,” or refreshing from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the
          third angel, and prepare the saints to stand in the period when the seven last plagues shall be poured
          out.</p>
      <p>[The angel of Revelation 14] presents a message that is to be proclaimed to the world just before Christ comes
          in the clouds of heaven.... Just prior to this time,</p>
      <p>then, the attention of the people is to be called to the <nobr>down-trodden</nobr> law of God, which is
          contained in the ark of the testament....</p>
      <p>They see that instead of observing the seventh day, the day that God sanctiﬁed, and commanded to be observed as
          the Sabbath, they are keeping the ﬁrst day of the week. But they honestly desire to do God’s will, and they
          begin to search the Scriptures to ﬁnd the reason for the change. Failing to ﬁnd any scriptural authority for
          the custom, the question arises, Shall we accept a truth that has become unpopular, and obey the commandments
          of God, or shall we continue with the world, and obey the commandments of men? With open Bibles they weep, and
          pray, and compare scripture with scripture, until, convinced of the truth, they conscientiously take their
          stand as keepers of the commandments of God.</p>
