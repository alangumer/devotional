    <h1>Chap. 13—He shall Reign Forever</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world
          are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. Revelation
          11:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The coming of Christ to usher in the reign of righteousness has inspired the most sublime ... utterances of the
          sacred writers.... The psalmist sang of the power and</p>
      <p>majesty of Israel’s King: ... “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad ...</p>
      <p>before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness,
          and the people with his truth.” Psalm <nobr>96:11-13.</nobr></p>
      <p>Said the prophet Isaiah:... “He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from
          off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth; for the Lord hath
          spoken it....” Isaiah 25:8....</p>
      <p>When the Saviour was about to be separated from His disciples, He comforted them in their sorrow with the
          assurance that He would come again: “Let not your heart be troubled....In my Father’s house are many
          mansions....I go to prepare a place</p>
      <p>for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself.” John
          <nobr>14:1-3....</nobr></p>
      <p>The angels who lingered upon Olivet after Christ’s ascension repeated to the disciples the promise of His
          return: “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen
          him go into heaven.” Acts 1:11. And the apostle Paul, speaking by the Spirit of Inspiration, testiﬁed: “The
          Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
          God.” 1 Thessalonians 4:16. Says the prophet of Patmos: “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall
          see him.” Revelation 1:7.</p>
      <p>About His coming cluster the glories of that “restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of
          all his holy prophets since the world began.” Acts 3:21. Then the <nobr>long-continued</nobr> rule of evil
          shall be broken; “the kingdoms of this world” will become “the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he
          shall reign for ever and ever.” Revelation 11:15.</p>
