    <h1>Chap. 155—The Devil’s Strategy Against Sabbathkeepers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? They gather
          themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. Psalm 94:20,
          21.</strong></p>
      <p>As the people of God approach the perils of the last days, Satan holds earnest consultation with his angels as
          to the most successful plan of overthrowing their faith....</p>
      <p>Says the great deceiver: “... The Sabbath is the great question which is to decide the destiny of souls. We
          must exalt the sabbath of our creating. We have caused it to be accepted by both worldlings and church
          members; now the church must be led to unite with the world in its support. We must work by signs and wonders
          to blind their eyes to the truth, and lead them to lay aside reason and the fear of God and follow custom and
          tradition.</p>
      <p>“I will inﬂuence popular ministers to turn the attention of their hearers from the commandments of God....</p>
      <p>“But our principal concern is to silence this sect of Sabbathkeepers. We must excite popular indignation
          against them. We will enlist great men and <nobr>worldly-wise</nobr> men upon our side, and induce those in
          authority to carry out our purposes. Then the sabbath which I have set up shall be enforced by laws the most
          severe and exacting. Those who disregard them shall be driven out from the cities and villages, and made to
          suffer hunger and privation. When once we have the power, we will show what we can do with those who will not
          swerve from their allegiance to God.... Now that</p>
      <p>we are bringing the Protestant churches and the world into harmony with this right arm of our strength, we will
          ﬁnally have a law to exterminate all who will not submit to our authority. When death shall be made the
          penalty of violating our sabbath, then many who are now ranked with commandment keepers will come over to our
          side.</p>
      <p>“But before proceeding to these extreme measures, we must ... ensnare those who honor the true Sabbath. We can
          separate many from Christ by worldliness, lust, and pride. They may think themselves safe because they believe
          the truth, but indulgence of appetite or the lower passions, which will confuse judgment and destroy
          discrimination, will cause their fall.”</p>
