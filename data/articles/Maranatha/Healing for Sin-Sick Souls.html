      <p><strong>The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there
          is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound
          up, neither molliﬁed with ointment. Isaiah 1:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a remedy for the <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> soul. That remedy is in Jesus. Precious Saviour! His grace is
          sufﬁcient for the weakest; and the strongest must also have His grace or perish.</p>
      <p>I saw how this grace could be obtained. Go to your closet, and there alone plead with God: “Create in me a
          clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” Be in earnest, be sincere.... Jacoblike, wrestle in
          prayer. Agonize.... You must make</p>
      <p>an effort....</p>
      <p>Seek the Lord with all your heart. Come with zeal, and when you sincerely feel that without the help of God you
          perish, when you pant after Him as the hart panteth after the water brooks, then will the Lord strengthen you
          speedily. Then will your peace pass all understanding. If you expect salvation, you must pray. Take time. Be
          not hurried and careless in your prayers. Beg of God to work in you a thorough reformation, that the fruits of
          His Spirit may dwell in you, and you shine as lights in the world. Be not a hindrance or curse to the cause of
          God; you can be a help, a blessing. Does Satan tell you that you cannot enjoy salvation full and free? Believe
          him not.</p>
      <p>I saw that it is the privilege of every Christian to enjoy the deep movings of the Spirit of God. A sweet,
          heavenly peace will pervade the mind, and you will love to meditate upon God and heaven. You will feast upon
          the glorious promises of His word....</p>
      <p>If professed Christians love Jesus better than the world, they will love to speak of Him, their best Friend, in
          whom their highest affections are centered. He came to their aid when they felt their lost and perishing
          condition. When weary and <nobr>heavy-laden</nobr> with sin, they turned unto Him. He removed their burden of
          guilt and sin, ... and turned the whole current of their affections. The things they once loved, they now
          hate; and the things they hated, they now love.</p>
      <p>Has this great change taken place in you?</p>
