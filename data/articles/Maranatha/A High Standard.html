    <h1>Chap. 33—A High Standard</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye
          should be mine. Leviticus 20:26.</strong></p>
      <p>I also saw many do not realize what they must be in order to live in the sight of the Lord without a high
          priest in the sanctuary through the time of trouble. Those who receive the seal of the living God and are
          protected in the time of trouble must reﬂect the image of Jesus fully.</p>
      <p>I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful and were looking to the time of “refreshing” and the
          “latter rain” to ﬁt them to stand in the day of the Lord and to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the
          time of trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation; therefore they could not
          receive the refreshing that all must have to ﬁt them to live in the sight of a holy God. Those who ... fail to
          purify their souls in obeying the whole truth ... will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and
          then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. But there will be ... no Mediator to plead
          their cause before the Father. Before this time the awfully solemn declaration has gone forth, “He that is
          unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is ﬁlthy, let him be ﬁlthy still: and he that is righteous, let
          him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”</p>
      <p>I saw that none could share the “refreshing” unless they obtain the victory over every besetment, over pride,
          selﬁshness, love of the world, and over every wrong word and action. We should, therefore, be drawing nearer
          and nearer to the Lord and be earnestly seeking that preparation necessary to enable us to stand in the battle
          in the day of the Lord. Let all remember that God is holy and that none but holy beings can ever dwell in His
          presence.</p>
      <p>We are today to watch that we offend not in word or deed.... We must today</p>
      <p>seek God and be determined that we will not rest satisﬁed without His presence. We should watch and work and
          pray as though this were the last day that would be granted us. How intensely earnest, then, would be our
          life. How closely would we follow Jesus in all our words and deeds.</p>
