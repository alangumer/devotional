    <h1>Chap. 356—Christ will be Our Teacher</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My people shall know my name: ... they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it
          is I. Isaiah 52:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Restored to His presence, man will again, as at the beginning, be taught of God. We have not the slightest idea
          of what will then be opened before us. With Christ we shall walk beside the living waters. He will unfold to
          us the beauty and glory of nature. He will reveal what He is to us, and what we are to Him. Truth we
          cannot</p>
      <p>know now, because of ﬁnite limitations, we shall know hereafter.</p>
      <p>In the world to come Christ will lead the redeemed beside the river of life and will teach them wonderful
          lessons of truth. He will unfold to them the mysteries of nature. They will see that a master hand holds the
          world in position. They will behold the skill displayed by the great Artist in coloring the ﬂowers of the
          ﬁeld, and will learn of the purposes of the merciful Father, who dispenses every ray of light, and with the
          holy angels the redeemed will acknowledge in songs of grateful praise God’s supreme love to an unthankful
          world.</p>
      <p>There will be open to the student, history of inﬁnite scope and of wealth inexpressible.... The history of the
          inception of sin; of fatal falsehood in its crooked</p>
      <p>working; of truth that, swerving not from its own straight lines, has met and conquered <nobr>error—all</nobr>
          will be made manifest. The veil that interposes between the visible and the invisible world will be drawn
          aside, and wonderful things will be revealed.</p>
      <p>With unutterable delight we shall enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. We shall share the
          treasures gained through ages upon ages spent in contemplation of God’s handiwork. And the years of eternity,
          as they roll, will continue to bring more glorious revelations. “Exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or
          think” (Ephesians 3:20) will be, forever and forever, the impartation of the gifts of God.</p>
      <p>We must get an education here that will enable us to live with God through the eternal ages. The education we
          begin here will be perfected in heaven. We will only just enter a higher grade.</p>
