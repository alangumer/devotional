    <h1>Chap. 275—The Elements Melt with Fervent Heat</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a
          great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
          shall be burned up. 2 Peter 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>In the day of the Lord, just before the coming of Christ, God will send lightnings from Heaven in His wrath,
          which will unite with ﬁre in the earth. The mountains will burn like a furnace, and will pour forth terrible
          streams of lava, destroying gardens and ﬁelds, villages and cities; and as they pour their melted ore, rocks
          and heated mud into the rivers, will cause them to boil like a pot, and send forth massive rocks and scatter
          their broken fragments upon the land with indescribable violence. Whole rivers will be dried up. The earth
          will be convulsed, and there will be dreadful eruptions and earthquakes everywhere. God will plague the wicked
          inhabitants of the earth until they are destroyed from off it.</p>
      <p>The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and be removed as a cottage. The elements shall be in ﬂames,
          and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll.</p>
      <p>The earth’s crust will be rent by the outbursts of the elements concealed in the bowels of the earth. These
          elements, once broken loose, will sweep away the treasures of those who for years have been adding to their
          wealth by securing large possessions at starvation prices from those in their employ.</p>
      <p>The great general conﬂagration is but just ahead, when all this wasted labor of life will be swept away in a
          night and day.</p>
      <p>There will be ... great destruction of human life. But as in the days of the great deluge Noah was preserved in
          the ark that God had prepared for him, so in these days of destruction and calamity, God will be the refuge of
          His believing ones. Through the psalmist He declares, “Because thou has made the Lord, which is my refuge,
          even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy
          dwelling.” “For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion....” Then shall we not make the Lord
          our surety and our defense?</p>
      <p>We should be preparing for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for them that love Him. There is a rest
          from earth’s conﬂict.</p>
