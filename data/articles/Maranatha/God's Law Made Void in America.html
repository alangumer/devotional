    <h1>Chap. 171—God’s Law Made Void in America</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law. Psalm 119:126.</strong></p>
      <p>A time is coming when the law of God is, in a special sense, to be made void in our land [the United States].
          The rulers of our nation will, by legislative enactments, enforce the Sunday law, and thus God’s people will
          be brought into great peril. When our nation, in its legislative councils, shall enact laws to bind the
          consciences of men in regard to their religious privileges, enforcing Sunday observance, and bringing
          oppressive power to bear against those who keep the <nobr>seventh-day</nobr> Sabbath, the law of God will, to
          all intents and purposes, be made void in our land.</p>
      <p>When the land which the Lord provided as an asylum for His people, that they might worship Him according to the
          dictates of their own consciences, the land over which for long years the shield of Omnipotence has been
          spread, the land which God has favored by making it the depository of the pure religion of
          <nobr>Christ—when</nobr> that land shall, through its legislators, abjure the principles of Protestantism, and
          give countenance to Romish apostasy in tampering with God’s <nobr>law—it</nobr> is then that the ﬁnal work of
          the man of sin will be revealed. Protestants will throw their whole inﬂuence and strength on the side of the
          Papacy; by a national act enforcing the false sabbath, they will give life and vigor to the corrupt faith of
          Rome, reviving her tyranny and oppression of conscience. Then it will be time for God to work in mighty power
          for the vindication of His truth.</p>
      <p>The prophet says: “I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened
          with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen....
          And I heard another</p>
      <p>voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
          receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.”
          When do her sins reach unto heaven? When the law of God is ﬁnally made void by legislation. Then the extremity
          of God’s people is His opportunity to show who is the governor of heaven and earth. As a Satanic power is
          stirring up the elements from beneath, God will send light and power to His people, that the message of truth
          may be proclaimed to all the world.</p>
