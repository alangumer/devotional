    <h1>Chap. 215—Character a Quality of the Soul</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. Job
          28:18.</strong></p>
      <p>A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we can take from this world to
          the next. Those who are under the instruction of Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with
          them to the heavenly mansions. And in heaven we are continually to improve....</p>
      <p>Mental ability and genius are not character, for these are often possessed by those who have the very opposite
          of a good character. Reputation is not character. True character is a quality of the soul, revealing itself in
          the conduct.</p>
      <p>A good character is a capital of more value than gold or silver. It is unaffected by panics or failures, and in
          that day when earthly possessions shall be swept away, it will bring rich returns. Integrity, ﬁrmness, and
          perseverance are qualities that all should seek earnestly to cultivate; for they clothe the possessor with a
          power which is <nobr>irresistible—a</nobr> power which makes him strong to do good, strong to resist evil,
          strong to bear adversity.</p>
      <p>Strength of character consists of two <nobr>things—power</nobr> of will and power of <nobr>self-control.</nobr>
          Many youth mistake strong, uncontrolled passion for strength of character; but the truth is that he who is
          mastered by his passions is a weak man. The real greatness and nobility of the man is measured by his powers
          to subdue his feelings, not by the power of his feelings to subdue him. The strongest man is he who, while
          sensitive to abuse, will yet restrain passion and forgive his enemies.</p>
      <p>If it were considered as important that the young possess a beautiful character and amiable disposition as it
          is that they imitate the fashions of the world in dress and deportment, we would see hundreds where there is
          one today coming upon the stage of active life prepared to exert an ennobling inﬂuence upon society.</p>
