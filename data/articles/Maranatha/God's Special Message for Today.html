    <h1>Chap. 99—God’s Special Message for Today</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us
          put on the armour of light. Romans 13:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In a time like this, we should have but one object in <nobr>view—the</nobr> employing of every means that God
          has provided by which the truth may be planted in the hearts of men.... It is the duty of every Christian to
          strive to the utmost of his ability to</p>
      <p>spread abroad the knowledge of the truth.</p>
      <p>God has waited long, and He is waiting still, to have the beings that are His by both creation and redemption,
          listen to His voice, and obey Him as loving, submissive children, whose desire is to be near His side, and to
          have the light of His countenance shining upon them. We are to bear the third angel’s message to the world,
          warning men against the worship of the beast and his image, and directing them to take their places in the
          ranks of those who “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” God has not revealed to us the time
          when this message will close, or when probation will have an end.... It is our duty to watch and work</p>
      <p>and wait, to labor every moment for the souls of men that are ready to perish....</p>
      <p>Now, just now, is the time for us to be watching, working, and waiting.... The</p>
      <p>end of all things is at hand.... The Spirit of the Lord is working to take the truth</p>
      <p>of the inspired word and stamp it upon the soul so that the professed followers of Christ will have a holy,
          sacred joy that they will be able to impart to others....</p>
      <p>There is need of a deeper, stronger, more constraining testimony on the power of the truth as seen in the
          practical godliness of those who profess to believe it.</p>
      <p>We are to have the truth planted in the heart, and teach it to others as it is in Jesus. The world is in a very
          solemn period; for souls are deciding what will be their eternal destiny. Satan and his angels are continually
          plotting to make void the law of God, and thus to enslave the souls of men in the toils of sin. The darkness
          which is covering the earth is deepening, but those who walk humbly with God have nothing to fear.</p>
