    <h1>Chap. 222—Sanctiﬁcation of the Whole Man</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
          righteousness and true holiness. Ephesians 4:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>The truth must sanctify the whole <nobr>man—his</nobr> mind, his thoughts, his heart, his strength. His vital
          powers will not be consumed upon his own lustful practices. These must be overcome, or they will overcome
          him.... The thoughts need purifying.</p>
      <p>What might not men and women have been had they realized that the treatment of the body has everything to do
          with the vigor and purity of mind and heart.</p>
      <p>The true Christian obtains an experience which brings holiness. He is without a spot of guilt upon the
          conscience, or a taint of corruption upon the soul. The spirituality of the law of God, with its limiting
          principles, is brought into his life. The light of truth irradiates his understanding. A glow of perfect love
          for the Redeemer clears away the miasma which has interposed between his soul and God. The will of God has
          become his will, pure, elevated, reﬁned, and sanctiﬁed. His countenance reveals the light of heaven. His body
          is a ﬁt temple for the Holy Spirit. Holiness adorns his character. God can commune with him; for soul and body
          are in harmony with God....</p>
      <p>God would have us realize that He has a right to mind, soul, body, and <nobr>spirit—to</nobr> all that we
          possess. We are His by creation and by redemption. As our Creator, He claims our entire service. As our
          Redeemer, He has a claim of love as well as of <nobr>right—of</nobr> love without a parallel. This claim we
          should realize every moment of our existence.... Our bodies, our souls, our lives, are His, not only because
          they are</p>
      <p>His free gift, but because He constantly supplies us with His beneﬁts, and gives us strength to use our
          faculties.... He says, “As many as received him, to them gave he</p>
      <p>power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.”...</p>
      <p>Those who are sons of God will represent Christ in character. Their works will be perfumed by the inﬁnite
          tenderness, compassion, love, and purity of the Son of God. And the more completely mind and body are yielded
          to the Holy Spirit, the greater will be the fragrance of our offering to Him.</p>
