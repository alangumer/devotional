    <h1>Chap. 1—The First Coming of Jesus</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,...to redeem them that were under the
          law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. Galatians 4:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>The Saviour’s coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam and Eve ﬁrst heard the promise, they looked for its speedy
          fulﬁllment. They joyfully welcomed their <nobr>ﬁrst-born</nobr> son, hoping that he might be the Deliverer.
          But the fulﬁllment of the promise tarried. Those who ﬁrst received it died without the sight. From the days of
          Enoch the promise was repeated through patriarchs and prophets, keeping alive the hope of His appearing, and
          yet He came not. The prophecy of Daniel revealed the time of His advent, but not all rightly interpreted the
          message. Century after century passed away; the voices of the prophets ceased. The hand of the oppressor was
          heavy upon Israel, and many were ready to exclaim, “The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth.” Ezekiel
          12:22.</p>
      <p>But like the stars in the vast circuit of their appointed path, God’s purposes know no haste and no delay.
          Through the symbols of the great darkness and the smoking furnace, God had revealed to Abraham the bondage of
          Israel in Egypt, and had declared that the time of their sojourning should be four hundred years. “Afterward,”
          He said, “shall they come out with great substance.” Genesis 15:14. Against that word, all the power of
          Pharaoh’s proud empire battled in vain. On “the <nobr>self-same</nobr> day” appointed in the divine promise,
          “it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.” Exodus 12:41. So in
          heaven’s council the hour for the coming of Christ had been determined. When the great clock of time pointed
          to that hour, Jesus was born in Bethlehem.</p>
      <p>“When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son.” Providence had directed the movements of
          nations, and the tide of human impulse and inﬂuence, until the world was ripe for the coming of the
          Deliverer....</p>
      <p>Then Jesus came to restore in man the image of his Maker. None but Christ can fashion anew the character that
          has been ruined by sin. He came to expel the demons that had controlled the will. He came to lift us up from
          the dust, to reshape the marred character after the pattern of His divine character, and to make it beautiful
          with His own glory.</p>
