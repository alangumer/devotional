    <h1>Chap. 325—Look at Things Eternal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which
          are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:18.</strong></p>
      <p>If the church will put on the robe of Christ’s righteousness, withdrawing from all allegiance with the world,
          there is before her the dawn of a bright and glorious day. God’s promise to her will stand fast forever....
          Truth, passing by those who despise</p>
      <p>and reject it, will triumph. Although at times apparently retarded, its progress has never been checked....
          Endowed with divine energy, it will cut its way through the</p>
      <p>strongest barriers and triumph over every obstacle.</p>
      <p>What sustained the Son of God during His life of toil and sacriﬁce? He saw the results of the travail of His
          soul and was satisﬁed. Looking into eternity, He beheld the happiness of those who through His humiliation had
          received pardon and everlasting life. His ear caught the shout of the redeemed. He heard the ransomed ones
          singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.</p>
      <p>We may have a vision of the future, the blessedness of heaven. In the Bible are revealed visions of the future
          glory, scenes pictured by the hand of God, and these are dear to His church. By faith we may stand on the
          threshold of the eternal city, and hear the gracious welcome given to those who in this life
          <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with Christ, regarding it as an honor to suffer for His sake. As the words are spoken,
          “Come, ye blessed of my Father,” they cast their crowns at the feet of the Redeemer, exclaiming, “Worthy is
          the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
          blessing.... Honour, and glory,</p>
      <p>and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.” Matthew 25:34;
          Revelation 5:12, 13.</p>
      <p>There the redeemed greet those who led them to the Saviour, and all unite in praising Him who died that human
          beings might have the life that measures with the life of God. The conﬂict is over. Tribulation and strife are
          at an end. Songs of victory ﬁll all heaven as the ransomed ones take up the joyful strain, Worthy, worthy is
          the Lamb that was slain, and lives again, a triumphant conqueror.</p>
