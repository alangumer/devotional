    <h1>Chap. 152—Coming Events Clearly Revealed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord God does nothing without giving to his servants the prophets knowledge of his plans. Amos 3:7,
          N.E.B.</strong></p>
      <p>The events connected with the close of probation and the work of preparation for the time of trouble, are
          clearly presented. But multitudes have no more understanding of these important truths than if they had never
          been revealed. Satan watches to catch away every impression that would make them wise unto salvation, and the
          time of trouble will ﬁnd them unready.</p>
      <p>As we near the close of this world’s history, the prophecies relating to the last days especially demand our
          study. The last book of the New Testament scriptures is full of truth that we need to understand.</p>
      <p>The solemn messages that have been given in their order in the Revelation are to occupy the ﬁrst place in the
          minds of God’s people....</p>
      <p>Precious time is rapidly passing, and there is danger that many will be robbed of the time which should be
          given to the proclamation of the messages that God has sent to a fallen world. Satan is pleased to see the
          diversion of minds that should be engaged in a study of the truths which have to do with eternal
          realities.</p>
      <p>The testimony of Christ, a testimony of the most solemn character, is to be borne to the world. All through the
          book of Revelation there are the most precious, elevating promises, and there are also warnings of the most
          fearfully solemn import. Will not those who profess to have a knowledge of the truth read the testimony given
          to John by Christ? Here is no guesswork, no scientiﬁc deception. Here are the truths that concern our present
          and future welfare. What is the chaff to the wheat?</p>
      <p>Only those who have been diligent students of the Scriptures and who have received the love of the truth will
          be shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world captive. By the Bible testimony these will detect
          the deceiver in his disguise. To all the testing time will come. By the sifting of temptation the genuine
          Christian will be revealed. Are the people of God now so ﬁrmly established upon His word that they would not
          yield to the evidence of their senses? Would they, in such a crisis, cling to the Bible and the Bible
          only?</p>
