    <h1>Chap. 188—Former Brethren Worst Persecutors</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. Matthew
          24:10.</strong></p>
      <p>As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith in the third angel’s message, but have not been
          sanctiﬁed through obedience to the truth, abandon their position and join the ranks of the opposition. By
          uniting with the world and partaking of its spirit, they have come to view matters in nearly the same light;
          and when the test is brought, they are prepared to choose the easy, popular side. Men of talent and pleasing
          address, who once rejoiced in the truth, employ their powers to deceive and mislead souls. They become the
          most bitter enemies of their former brethren. When Sabbathkeepers are brought before the courts to answer for
          their faith, these apostates are the most efﬁcient agents of Satan to misrepresent and accuse them, and by
          false reports and insinuations to stir up the rulers against them.</p>
      <p>The season of distress before God’s people will call for a faith that will not falter. His children must make
          it manifest that He is the only object of their worship, and that no consideration, not even that of life
          itself, can induce them to make the least concession to false worship.</p>
      <p>At that time the gold will be separated from the dross.... Many a star that we have</p>
      <p>admired for its brilliance will then go out in darkness. Those who have assumed the ornaments of the sanctuary,
          but are not clothed with Christ’s righteousness, will then appear in the shame of their own nakedness.</p>
      <p>Among earth’s inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like
          the stars of heaven, which appear only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the
          earth and gross darkness the people.... In the hour of deepest apostasy, when Satan’s supreme effort is made
          to</p>
      <p>cause “all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,” to receive, under penalty of death, the sign
          of allegiance to a false rest day, these faithful ones ... will “shine as lights in the world.” ...
          Philippians 2:15. The darker the night, the more brilliantly will they shine.</p>
