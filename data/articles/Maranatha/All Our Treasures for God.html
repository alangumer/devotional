    <h1>Chap. 116—All Our Treasures for God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Freely ye have received, freely give. Matthew 10:8.</strong></p>
      <p>All that men receive of God’s bounty still belongs to God. Whatever He has bestowed in the valuable and
          beautiful things of earth is placed in our hands to test us, to sound the depths of our love for Him and our
          appreciation of His favors. Whether it be the treasures of wealth or of intellect, they are to be laid, a
          willing offering, at the feet of Jesus.</p>
      <p>In commissioning His disciples to go “into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,” Christ
          assigned to men the work of extending the knowledge of His grace. But while some go forth to preach, He calls
          upon others ... for offerings with which to support His cause in the earth.</p>
      <p>Not all can make large offerings, not all can do great works, magniﬁcent deeds; but all can practice
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> all can reveal the unselﬁshness of the Saviour. Some can bring large gifts to the
          Lord’s treasury; others can bring only mites; but every gift brought in sincerity is accepted by the
          Lord.</p>
      <p>Many would be surprised to see how much could be saved for the cause of God by acts of
          <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> The small sums saved by deeds of sacriﬁce will do more for the upbuilding of the
          cause of God than larger gifts will accomplish that have not called for denial of self.</p>
      <p>The spirit of liberality is the spirit of heaven. Christ’s <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> love is revealed upon
          the cross. That man might be saved, He gave all that He had and then gave Himself. The cross of Christ appeals
          to the benevolence of every follower of the blessed Saviour. The principle there illustrated is to give,
          give.... The principle</p>
      <p>of worldlings is to get, get....</p>
      <p>The light of the gospel shining from the cross of Christ rebukes selﬁshness....</p>
      <p>Many of God’s people are in danger of being ensnared by worldliness and covetousness. They should understand
          that it is His mercy that multiplies the demands for their means.... He thus makes man the medium through
          which to</p>
      <p>distribute His blessings on earth. God planned the system of beneﬁcence in order that man might become like his
          Creator, benevolent and unselﬁsh in character, and ﬁnally be a partaker with Christ of the eternal, glorious
          reward.</p>
