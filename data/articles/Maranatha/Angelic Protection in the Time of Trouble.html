    <h1>Chap. 262—Angelic Protection in the Time of Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were
          for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. Isaiah 26:20.</strong></p>
      <p>In the day of ﬁerce trial He [Christ] will say, “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
          doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.” What are
          the chambers in which they are to hide? They are the protection of Christ and holy angels. The people of God
          are not at this time all in one place. They are in different companies, and in all parts of the earth.</p>
      <p>I saw the saints leaving the cities and villages, and associating together in companies, and living in the most
          solitary places. Angels provided them food and water, while the wicked were suffering from hunger and
          thirst.</p>
      <p>During the night a very impressive scene passed before me. There seemed to be great confusion and the conﬂict
          of armies. A messenger from the Lord stood before me, and said, “Call your household. I will lead you; follow
          me.” He led me down a dark passage, through a forest, then through the clefts of mountains, and said, “Here
          you are safe.” There were others who had been led to this retreat. The heavenly messenger said. “The time of
          trouble has come as a thief in the night, as the Lord warned you it would come.”</p>
      <p>In the time of trouble just before the coming of Christ, the righteous will be preserved through the
          ministration of heavenly angels; but there will be no security for the transgressor of God’s law. Angels
          cannot then protect those who are disregarding one of the divine precepts.</p>
      <p>In the closing period of earth’s history the Lord will work mightily in behalf of those who stand steadfastly
          for the right.... In the midst of the time of</p>
      <p><nobr>trouble—trouble</nobr> such as has not been since there was a <nobr>nation—His</nobr> chosen ones will
          stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God’s saints. Angels that excel
          in strength will protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a “God of gods,” able to
          save to the uttermost those who have put their trust in Him.</p>
