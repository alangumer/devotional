    <h1>Chap. 272—God Overturns Nature</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple
          of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
          was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
          Revelation 16:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>We need to study the pouring out of the seventh vial. The powers of evil will not yield up the conﬂict without
          a struggle.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the angry heavens is one clear space of indescribable glory, whence comes the voice of God like
          the sound of many waters, saying: “It is done.” Revelation 16:17.</p>
      <p>That voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is a mighty earthquake, “such as was not since men were upon
          the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.” Verses 17, 18. The ﬁrmament appears to open and shut. The
          glory from the throne of God seems ﬂashing through. The mountains shake like a reed in the wind, and ragged
          rocks are scattered on every side. There is a roar as of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There
          is heard the shriek of a hurricane like the voice of demons upon a mission of destruction. The whole earth
          heaves and swells like the waves of the sea. Its surface is breaking up. Its very foundations seem to be
          giving away. Mountain chains are sinking. Inhabited islands disappear. The seaports that have become like
          Sodom for wickedness are swallowed up by the angry waters. Babylon the great has come in remembrance before
          God, “to give unto her the cup of the wine of the ﬁerceness of his wrath.” Great hailstones, every one “about
          the weight of a talent,” are doing their work of destruction. Verses 19, 21. The proudest cities of the earth
          are laid low. The lordly palaces, upon which the world’s great men have lavished their wealth in order to
          glorify themselves, are crumbling to ruin before their eyes. Prison walls are rent asunder, and God’s people,
          who have been held in bondage for their faith, are set free.</p>
