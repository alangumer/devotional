    <h1>Chap. 329—Satan Loosed from His Prison</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to
          deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth. Revelation 20:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>At the close of the thousand years the second resurrection will take place. Then the wicked will be raised from
          the dead and appear before God for the execution of “the judgment written.” Thus the revelator, after
          describing the resurrection of the righteous, says: “The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
          years were ﬁnished.” Revelation 20:5. And Isaiah declares, concerning the wicked: “They shall be gathered
          together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall
          they be visited.” Isaiah 24:22.</p>
      <p>Now Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle for the supremacy. While deprived of his power and cut off from
          his work of deception, the prince of evil was miserable and dejected; but as the wicked dead are raised and he
          sees the vast multitudes upon his side, his hopes revive, and he determines not to yield the great
          controversy. He will marshal all the armies of the lost under his banner and through them endeavor to execute
          his plans. The wicked are Satan’s captives. In rejecting Christ they have accepted the rule of the rebel
          leader. They are ready to receive his suggestions and to do his bidding. Yet, true to his early cunning, he
          does not acknowledge himself to be Satan. He claims to be the prince who is the rightful owner of the world
          and whose inheritance has been unlawfully wrested from him. He represents himself to his deluded subjects as a
          redeemer, assuring them that his power has brought them forth from their graves and that he is about to rescue
          them from the most cruel tyranny. The presence of Christ having been removed, Satan works wonders to support
          his claims. He makes the weak strong and inspires all with his own spirit and energy. He proposes to lead them
          against the camp of the saints and to take possession of the City of God. With ﬁendish exultation he points to
          the unnumbered millions who have been raised from the dead and declares that as their leader he is well able
          to overthrow the city and regain his throne and his kingdom.</p>
