    <h1>Chap. 315—The Reward of the Redeemed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If any man’s work abide..., he shall receive a reward.1 Corinthians 3:14. Glorious will be the reward
          bestowed when the faithful workers gather about</strong></p>
      <p>the throne of God and of the Lamb. When John in his mortal state beheld the glory of God, he fell as one dead;
          he was not able to endure the sight. But when the children of God shall have put on immortality, they will
          “see him as he is.” 1 John 3:2. They will stand before the throne, accepted in the Beloved. All their sins
          have been blotted out, all their transgressions borne away. Now they can look upon the undimmed glory of the
          throne of God. They have been partakers with Christ in His sufferings, they have been workers together with
          Him in the plan of redemption, and they are partakers with Him in the joy of seeing souls saved in the kingdom
          of God, there to praise God through all eternity.</p>
      <p>In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and the Son. The angels, touching their
          golden harps, will welcome the King and His trophies of victory....A song of triumph will peal forth, ﬁlling
          all heaven. Christ has conquered.</p>
      <p>He enters the heavenly courts, accompanied by His redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of suffering
          and sacriﬁce has not been in vain....</p>
      <p>There are homes for the pilgrims of earth. There are robes for the righteous, with crowns of glory and palms of
          victory. All that has perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world to come be made plain. The
          things hard to be understood will then ﬁnd explanation. The mysteries of grace will unfold before us. Where
          our ﬁnite minds discovered only confusion and broken promises, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful
          harmony. We shall know that inﬁnite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying. As we realize the
          tender care of Him who makes all things work together for our good, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and
          full of glory.</p>
      <p>I urge you to prepare for the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven.... Prepare</p>
      <p>for the judgment, that when Christ shall come, to be admired in all them that believe, you may be among those
          who will meet Him in peace.</p>
