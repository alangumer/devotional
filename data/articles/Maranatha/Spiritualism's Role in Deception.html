    <h1>Chap. 158—Spiritualism’s Role in Deception</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false
          prophets are gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Many will be ensnared through the belief that spiritualism is a merely human imposture; when brought face to
          face with manifestations which they cannot but regard as supernatural, they will be deceived, and will be led
          to accept them as the great power of God.</p>
      <p>As the teachings of spiritualism are accepted by the churches, the restraint imposed upon the carnal heart is
          removed, and the profession of religion will become a cloak to conceal the basest iniquity. A belief in
          spiritual manifestations opens the door to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, and thus the inﬂuence of
          evil angels will be felt in the churches.</p>
      <p>The popular ministry cannot successfully resist spiritualism. They have nothing wherewith to shield their ﬂocks
          from its baleful inﬂuence. Much of the sad result of spiritualism will rest upon ministers of this age; for
          they have trampled the truth under their feet, and in its stead have preferred fables.</p>
      <p>Satan has long been preparing for his ﬁnal effort to deceive the world. The foundation of his work was laid by
          the assurance given to Eve in Eden: “Ye shall not surely die.” “In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
          shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” Genesis 3:4, 5. Little by little he has
          prepared the way for his masterpiece of deception in the development of spiritualism. He has not yet reached
          the full accomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the last remnant of time. Says the prophet:
          “I saw three unclean spirits like frogs....They are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth
          unto the</p>
      <p>kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”
          Revelation 16:13, 14. Except those who are kept by the power of God, through faith in His word, the whole
          world will be swept into the ranks of this delusion. The people are fast being lulled to a fatal security, to
          be awakened only by the outpouring of the wrath of God.</p>
