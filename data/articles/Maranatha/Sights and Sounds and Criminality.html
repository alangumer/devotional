    <h1>Chap. 137—Sights and Sounds and Criminality</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not
          cleave to me. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. Psalm 101:3,
          4.</strong></p>
      <p>There is reason for deep solicitude on your part for your children, who have temptations to encounter at every
          advance step. It is impossible for them to avoid contact with evil associates.... They will see sights, hear
          sounds, and be subjected to</p>
      <p>inﬂuences which are demoralizing and which, unless they are thoroughly guarded, will imperceptibly but surely
          corrupt the heart and deform the character....</p>
      <p>Some fathers and mothers are so indifferent, so careless, that they think it makes no difference whether their
          children attend a church school or a public school. “We are in the world,” they say, “and we cannot get out of
          it.” But, parents, we can get a good way out of the world, if we choose to do so. We can avoid seeing many of
          the evils that are multiplying so fast in these last days....</p>
      <p>To the active minds of children and youth the scenes pictured in imaginary revelations of the future are
          realities. As revolutions are predicted and all manner of proceedings described that break down the barriers
          of law and <nobr>self-restraint,</nobr> many catch the spirit of these representations. They are led to the
          commission of crimes even worse, if possible, than these sensational writers depict. Through such inﬂuences as
          these society is becoming demoralized. The seeds of lawlessness are sown broadcast. None need marvel that a
          harvest of crime is the result...</p>
      <p>Say ﬁrmly: “I will not spend precious moments in reading that which will be of no proﬁt to me, and which only
          unﬁts me to be of service to others. I will devote my time and my thoughts to acquiring a ﬁtness for God’s
          service. I will close my eyes to frivolous and sinful things. My ears are the Lord’s, and I will not listen to
          the subtle reasoning of the enemy. My voice shall not in any way be subject to a will that is not under the
          inﬂuence of the Spirit of God. My body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and every power of my being shall be
          consecrated to worthy pursuits.”</p>
