    <h1>Chap. 321—The Great Multitude of the Redeemed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and
          kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and
          palms in their hands. Revelation 7:9.</strong></p>
      <p>All classes, all nations and kindreds and people and tongues will stand before the throne of God and the Lamb
          with their spotless robes and jeweled crowns. Said the angel, These are they that have come up through great
          tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white, while the lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
          God, the <nobr>self-indulgent</nobr> and disobedient, have lost both worlds. They have neither the things of
          this life nor the immortal life.</p>
      <p>That triumphant throng, with songs of victory and with crowns and harps, have trodden in the ﬁery furnace of
          earthly afﬂiction when it was heated and intensely hot. From destitution, from hunger and torture, they come,
          from deep <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and bitter disappointments. Look upon them now as conquerors, no longer
          poor, no longer in sorrow, in afﬂiction and hated of all men for Christ’s sake. Behold their heavenly
          garments, white and shining, richer than any kingly robe. Look by faith upon their jeweled crowns; never did
          such a diadem deck the brow of any earthly monarch.</p>
      <p>Listen to their voices as they sing loud hosannas and as they wave the palm branches of victory. Rich music
          ﬁlls heaven as their voices sing forth these words: “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain and rose again
          forevermore. Salvation unto our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” And the angelic host,
          angels and archangels, covering cherub and glorious seraph, echo back the refrain of that joyous, triumphant
          song saying, “Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be
          unto our God for ever and ever” (Revelation 7:12).</p>
      <p>Oh, in that day it will be discovered that the righteous were the wise ones, while the sinful and disobedient
          were fools.... Shame and everlasting contempt is their</p>
      <p>portion. Those who have been colaborers for Christ will then be near the throne of God, girt with purity and
          the garments of eternal righteousness.</p>
