    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than
          your thoughts. Isaiah 55:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Our plans are not always God’s plans....</p>
      <p>In His loving care and interest for us, often He who understands us better than we understand ourselves refuses
          to permit us selﬁshly to seek the gratiﬁcation of our own ambition.... Often our plans fail that God’s plans
          for us may succeed....</p>
      <p>In the future life the mysteries that here have annoyed and disappointed us will be made plain. We shall see
          that our seemingly unanswered prayers and disappointed hopes have been among our greatest blessings.</p>
      <p>We are not now sufﬁciently advanced in spiritual attainments to comprehend the mysteries of God. But when we
          shall compose the family of heaven, these mysteries will be unfolded before us....</p>
      <p>Then much will be revealed in explanation of matters upon which God now keeps silence because we have not
          gathered up and appreciated that which has been made known of the eternal mysteries. The ways of Providence
          will be made clear; the mysteries of grace through Christ will be unfolded. That which the mind cannot now
          grasp, which is hard to be understood, will be explained. We shall see order in that which has seemed
          unexplainable; wisdom in everything withheld; goodness and gracious mercy in everything imparted. Truth will
          be unfolded to the mind, free from obscurity, in a single line, and its brightness will be endurable. The
          heart will be made to sing for joy. Controversies will be forever ended, and all difﬁculties will be
          solved.</p>
      <p>All that has perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world to come be made plain. The things hard to
          be understood will then ﬁnd explanation. The mysteries of grace will unfold before us. Where our ﬁnite minds
          discovered only confusion and broken promises, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. We shall
          know that inﬁnite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying. As we realize the tender care of Him
          who makes all things work together for our good, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
