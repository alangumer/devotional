    <h1>Chap. 24—The Church will not Fall</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Matthew
          16:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus will feel the ire of the dragon and his hosts.
          Satan numbers the world as his subjects, he has gained control of the apostate churches; but here is a little
          company that are resisting his supremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete.
          As he inﬂuenced the heathen nations to destroy Israel, so in the near future he will stir up the wicked powers
          of earth to destroy the people of God.... Their only hope</p>
      <p>is in the mercy of God; their only defense will be prayer.</p>
      <p>The trying experiences that came to God’s people in the days of Esther were not peculiar to that age alone. The
          revelator, looking down the ages to the close of time, has declared, “The dragon was wroth with the woman, and
          went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of
          Jesus Christ.” Revelation 12:17. Some who today are living on the earth will see these words fulﬁlled.</p>
      <p>The wrath of Satan increases as his time grows short, and his work of deceit and destruction will reach its
          culmination in the time of trouble.</p>
      <p>Satan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his power as supreme. The church may appear as about to
          fall, but it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted <nobr>out—the</nobr> chaff
          separated from the precious wheat. This is a terrible ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place. None but
          those who have been overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony will be found with the
          loyal and true, without spot or stain of sin, without guile in their mouths.</p>
      <p>God declares that even a mother may forget her child, “yet will I not forget thee.” ... God thinks of His
          children with the tenderest solicitude and keeps a book of remembrance before Him, that He may never forget
          the children of His care.</p>
