    <h1>Chap. 164—Sabbath vs Sunday Issue Joins</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image,
          and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.
          Revelation 14:9, 10.</strong></p>
      <p>Heretofore those who presented the truths of the third angel’s message have often been regarded as mere
          alarmists. Their predictions that religious intolerance would gain control in the United States, that church
          and state would unite to persecute those who keep the commandments of God, have been pronounced groundless and
          absurd.... But as the question of enforcing Sunday observance is</p>
      <p>widely agitated, the event so long doubted and disbelieved is seen to be approaching, and the third message
          will produce an effect which it could not have had before....</p>
      <p>Men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth with holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives
          them. The sins of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results of enforcing the observances of the church by
          civil authority, the inroads of spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal
          <nobr>power—all</nobr> will be unmasked. By these solemn warnings the people will be stirred.... As the
          people</p>
      <p>go to their former teachers with the eager inquiry, Are these things so? the ministers present fables, prophesy
          smooth things, to soothe their fears and quiet the awakened conscience. But since many refuse to be satisﬁed
          with the mere authority of men and demand a plain “Thus saith the Lord,” the popular ministry, like the
          Pharisees of old, ﬁlled with anger as their authority is questioned, will denounce the message as of Satan and
          stir up the <nobr>sin-loving</nobr> multitudes to revile and persecute those who proclaim it.</p>
      <p>As the controversy extends into new ﬁelds and the minds of the people are called to God’s downtrodden law,
          Satan is astir. The power attending the message will only madden those who oppose it. The clergy will put
          forth almost superhuman efforts to shut away the light lest it should shine upon their ﬂocks. By every means
          at their command they will endeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital questions. The church appeals to
          the strong arm of civil power, and, in this work, papists and Protestants unite.</p>
