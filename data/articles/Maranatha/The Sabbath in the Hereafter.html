      <p><strong>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so
          shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from
          one sabbath to another, shall all ﬂesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. Isaiah 66:22,
          23.</strong></p>
      <p>In the beginning the Father and the Son had rested upon the Sabbath after Their work of creation. When “the
          heavens and the earth were ﬁnished, and all the host of them” (Genesis 2:1), the Creator and all heavenly
          beings rejoiced in contemplation of the glorious scene. “The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of
          God shouted for joy.” Job 38:7.... When there shall be a “restitution of all things, which</p>
      <p>God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began” (Acts 3:21), the creation Sabbath,
          the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph’s tomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and
          earth will unite in praise, as “from one sabbath to another” (Isaiah 66:23) the nations of the saved shall bow
          in joyful worship to God and the Lamb.</p>
      <p>The nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of heaven. All will be a happy, united family,
          clothed with the garments of praise and thanksgiving. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and
          the sons of God will shout for joy....</p>
      <p>“And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all ﬂesh
          come to worship before me, saith the Lord.” The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all ﬂesh shall see it
          together.” “The Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.” “In that
          day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his
          people.”</p>
      <p>So long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will continue as a sign of the Creator’s power. And
          when Eden shall bloom on earth again, God’s holy rest day will be honored by all beneath the sun. “From one
          sabbath to another” the inhabitants of the gloriﬁed new earth shall go up “to worship before me, saith the
          Lord.” Isaiah 66:23.</p>
