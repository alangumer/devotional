      <p><strong>He will ﬁnish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon
          the earth. Romans 9:28.</strong></p>
      <p>In the prophecy of Jerusalem’s destruction Christ said, “Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall
          wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall
          be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” This prophecy will
          again be fulﬁlled. The abounding iniquity of that day ﬁnds its counterpart in this generation. So with the
          prediction in regard to the preaching of the gospel. Before the fall of Jerusalem, Paul, writing by the Holy
          Spirit, declared that the gospel was preached to “every creature which is under heaven.” Colossians 1:23. So
          now, before the coming of the Son of man, the everlasting gospel is to be preached “to every nation, and
          kindred, and tongue, and people.” Revelation 14:6, 14. God “hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
          the world.” Acts 17:31. Christ tells us when that day shall be ushered in. He does not say that all the world
          will be converted, but that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto
          all nations; and then shall the end come.” By giving the gospel to the world it is in our power to hasten our
          Lord’s return. We are not only to look for but to hasten the coming of the day of God. 2 Peter 3:12, margin.
          Had the church of Christ done her appointed work as the Lord ordained, the whole world would before this have
          been warned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to our earth in power and great glory.</p>
      <p>It is the unbelief, the worldliness, unconsecration, and strife among the Lord’s professed people that have
          kept us in this world of sin and sorrow so many years....</p>
      <p>We may have to remain here in this world because of insubordination many more years, as did the children of
          Israel; but for Christ’s sake, His people should not add sin to sin by charging God with the consequence of
          their own wrong course of action.</p>
