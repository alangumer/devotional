    <h1>Chap. 237—Importance and Glory of the Sabbath</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob
          thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Isaiah 58:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Sabbath we had a sweet, glorious time.... We were made to rejoice and glorify</p>
      <p>God for His exceeding goodness unto us.... I was taken off in vision....</p>
      <p>I saw that we sensed and realized but little of the importance of the Sabbath, to what we yet should realize
          and know of its importance and glory. I saw we knew not what it was yet to ride upon the high places of the
          earth and to be fed with the heritage of Jacob. But when the refreshing and latter rain shall come from the
          presence of the Lord and the glory of His power we shall know what it is to be fed with the heritage of Jacob
          and ride upon the high places of the earth. Then shall we see the Sabbath more in its importance and glory.
          But we shall not see it in all its glory and importance until the covenant of peace is made with us at the
          voice of God, and the pearly gates of the New Jerusalem are thrown open and swing back on their glittering
          hinges and the glad and joyful voice of the lovely Jesus is heard richer than any music that ever fell on
          mortal ear bidding us enter. [I saw] that we had a perfect right in the city for we had kept the commandments
          of God, and heaven, sweet heaven is our home.</p>
      <p>I saw the ten commandments written on them [the tables of stone] with the ﬁnger of God. On one table were four,
          and on the other six. The four on the ﬁrst table shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth, the
          Sabbath commandment, shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of God’s holy
          name. The holy Sabbath looked <nobr>glorious—a</nobr> halo of glory was all around it. I saw that the Sabbath
          commandment was not nailed to the cross. If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to
          break them all, as well as to break the fourth....</p>
      <p>I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and will be, the separating wall between the true Israel of God and
          unbelievers; and that the Sabbath is the great question to unite the hearts of God’s dear, waiting
          saints.</p>
