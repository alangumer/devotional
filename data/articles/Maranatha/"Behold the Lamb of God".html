    <h1>Chap. 109—“Behold the Lamb of God”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. John 1:29. John had by nature the
          faults and weaknesses common to humanity; but the</strong></p>
      <p>touch of divine love had transformed him. When, after Christ’s ministry began, the disciples of John came to
          him with the complaint that all men were following the new Teacher, John showed how clearly he understood his
          relation to the Messiah, and how gladly he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared the way.</p>
      <p>“A man can receive nothing,” he said, “except it be given him from heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that
          I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.... This my joy therefore is fulﬁlled. He must
          increase, but I must decrease.”</p>
      <p>John <nobr>3:27-30.</nobr></p>
      <p>Looking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height of <nobr>self-abnegation.</nobr> He sought not
          to attract men to himself, but to lift their thoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon the
          Lamb of God. He himself had been only a voice, a cry in the wilderness. Now with joy he accepted silence and
          obscurity, that the eyes of all might be turned to the Light of life.</p>
      <p>Those who are true to their calling as messengers for God will not seek honor for themselves. Love for self
          will be swallowed up in love for Christ. They will recognize that it is their work to proclaim, as did John
          the Baptist: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” John 1:29. They will lift up
          Jesus, and with Him humanity will be lifted up....</p>
      <p>The soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was ﬁlled with the light of the Divine....</p>
      <p>He bore witness to the Saviour’s glory.... In this glory of Christ, all His followers</p>
      <p>are to share.... We can receive of heaven’s light only as we are willing to be emptied</p>
      <p>of self. We can discern the character of God, and accept Christ by faith, only as we consent to the bringing
          into captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. To all who do this, the Holy Spirit is given
          without measure. In Christ “dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him.”
          Colossians 2:9, 10.</p>
