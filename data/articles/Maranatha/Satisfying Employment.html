    <h1>Chap. 342—Satisfying Employment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. John 5:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Heaven is a place of interested activity; yet to the weary and heavy laden, to those who have fought the good
          ﬁght of faith, it will be a glorious rest; for the youth and vigor of immortality will be theirs, and against
          sin and Satan they will no longer have to contend. To these energetic workers a state of eternal indolence
          would be irksome. It would be no heaven to them.</p>
      <p>To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden, “to dress it and to keep it.” Their occupation
          was not wearisome, but pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to occupy his
          mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In mental and physical activity Adam found one of
          the highest pleasures of his holy existence....</p>
      <p>Those who regard work as a curse, attended though it be with weariness and pain, are cherishing an error. The
          rich often look down with contempt upon the working classes, but this is wholly at variance with God’s purpose
          in creating man. What are the possessions of even the most wealthy in comparison with the heritage given to
          the lordly Adam? Yet Adam was not to be idle. Our Creator, who understands what is for man’s happiness,
          appointed Adam his work. The true joy of life is found only by the working men and women.</p>
      <p>Work is constantly being done in heaven. There are no idlers there. “My Father worketh hitherto,” said Christ,
          “and I work.” We cannot suppose that when the ﬁnal triumph shall come, and we have the mansions prepared for
          us, idleness will be our <nobr>portion—that</nobr> we shall rest in a blissful, <nobr>do-nothing</nobr>
          state.</p>
      <p>God designs that all shall be workers. The toiling beast of burden answers the purpose of its creation better
          than does the indolent man. God is a constant worker. The angels are workers; they are ministers of God to the
          children of men. Those who look forward to a heaven of inactivity will be disappointed, for the economy of
          heaven provides no place for the gratiﬁcation of indolence. But to the weary and <nobr>heavy-laden</nobr> rest
          is promised. It is the faithful servant who will be welcomed from his labors to the joy of his Lord.</p>
