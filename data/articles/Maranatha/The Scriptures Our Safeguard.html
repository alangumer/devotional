    <h1>Chap. 87—The Scriptures Our Safeguard</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
          Hebrews 1:14.</strong></p>
      <p>So long as the people of God preserve their ﬁdelity to Him, so long as they cling by living faith to Jesus,
          they are under the protection of heavenly angels, and Satan will not be permitted to exercise his hellish arts
          upon them to their destruction. But those who separate themselves from Christ by sin are in great
          peril....</p>
      <p>Satan is now more earnestly engaged in playing the game of life for souls than at any previous time; and unless
          we are constantly on our guard, he will establish in our hearts, pride, love of self, love of the world, and
          many other evil traits. He will also use every possible device to unsettle our faith in God and in the truths
          of His Word. If we have not a deep experience in the things of God, if we have not a thorough knowledge of His
          Word, we shall be beguiled to our ruin by the errors and sophistries of the enemy. False doctrines will sap
          the foundations of many, because they have not learned to discern truth from error. Our only safeguard against
          the wiles of Satan is to study the Scriptures diligently, to have an intelligent understanding of the reasons
          of our faith, and faithfully to perform every known duty. The indulgence of one known sin will cause weakness
          and darkness, and subject us to ﬁerce temptation....</p>
      <p>Are we opening the door of the heart to Jesus, and closing every means of entrance to Satan? Are we daily
          obtaining clearer light, and greater strength, that we may stand in Christ’s righteousness? Are we emptying
          our hearts of all selﬁshness, and cleansing them, preparatory to receiving the latter rain from heaven?
          ...</p>
      <p>The work of overcoming is a great work. Shall we take hold of it with energy and perseverance? Unless we do,
          our “ﬁlthy garments” will not be taken from us. We need never expect that these will be torn from us
          violently; we must ﬁrst show a desire to rid ourselves of them. We must seek to separate sin from us, relying
          upon the merits of the blood of Christ; and then in the day of afﬂiction, when the enemy presses us, we shall
          walk among the angels.</p>
