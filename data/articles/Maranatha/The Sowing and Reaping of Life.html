    <h1>Chap. 74—The Sowing and Reaping of Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow after righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on
          the Lord out of a pure heart. 2 Timothy 2:22.</strong></p>
      <p>A little time spent in sowing your wild oats, dear young friends, will produce a crop that will embitter your
          whole life; an hour of thoughtlessness, once yielding to temptation, may turn the whole current of your life
          in the wrong direction. You can have but one youth; make that useful. When once you have passed over the
          ground you can never return to rectify your mistakes....</p>
      <p>Satan...transforms himself into an angel of light and comes to the youth with his specious temptations and
          succeeds in winning them, step by step, from the path of duty. He is described as an accuser, a deceiver, a
          liar, a tormentor, and a murderer.</p>
      <p>...It is Satan’s act to tempt you, but your own act to yield. It is not in the power of all the host of Satan
          to force the tempted to transgress. There is no excuse for sin.</p>
      <p>Temptation is not sin. Jesus was holy and pure; yet He was tempted in all points as we are, but with a strength
          and power that man will never be called upon to endure. In His successful resistance He has left us a bright
          example, that we should follow in His steps. If we are <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr> or
          <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> we shall be left to fall under the power of temptation; but if we look to Jesus
          and trust in Him we call to our aid a power that has conquered the foe on the ﬁeld of battle, and with every
          temptation He will make a way of escape. When Satan comes in like a ﬂood, we must meet his temptations with
          the sword of the Spirit, and Jesus will be our helper and will lift up for us a standard against him.</p>
      <p>One wrong trait of character, one sinful desire cherished, will eventually neutralize all the power of the
          gospel.... The pains of duty and the pleasures of</p>
      <p>sin are the cords with which Satan binds men in his snares. Those who would rather die than perform a wrong act
          are the only ones who will be found faithful.</p>
      <p>The youth may have principles so ﬁrm that the most powerful temptations of Satan will not draw them away from
          their allegiance.</p>
