    <h1>Chap. 345—Inheritance of the Saved</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
          Isaiah 32:18.</strong></p>
      <p>In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called “a country.” Hebrews <nobr>11:14-16.</nobr> There the
          heavenly Shepherd leads His ﬂock to fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit every month,
          and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the nations. There are <nobr>ever-ﬂowing</nobr> streams,
          clear as crystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the ransomed of
          the Lord. There the <nobr>wide-spreading</nobr> plains swell into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God
          rear their lofty summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God’s people, so long
          pilgrims and wanderers, shall ﬁnd a home....</p>
      <p>There, “the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom
          as the rose.” “Instead of the thorn shall come up the ﬁr tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the
          myrtle tree.” “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; ... and a
          little child shall lead them.” “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,” saith the Lord.
          Isaiah 35:1; 55:13; Isaiah 11:6, 9. There man will be restored to his lost kingship, and the lower order of
          beings will again recognize his sway; the ﬁerce will become gentle, and the timid trustful.</p>
      <p>Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be no more tears, no funeral trains, no badges of
          mourning. “There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying: ... for the former things are passed
          away.” “The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their
          iniquity.” Revelation 21:4; Isaiah 33:24.</p>
      <p>There the Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and ﬁeld. “They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and
          they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall
          not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long
          enjoy the work of their hands.” Isaiah 65:21, 22.</p>
