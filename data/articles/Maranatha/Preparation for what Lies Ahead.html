    <h1>Chap. 153—Preparation for what Lies Ahead</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek
          meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger. Zephaniah 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Transgression has almost reached its limit. Confusion ﬁlls the world, and a great terror is soon to come upon
          human beings. The end is very near. God’s people should be preparing for what is to break upon the world as an
          overwhelming surprise.</p>
      <p>The “time of trouble, such as never was,” is soon to open upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do
          not now possess and which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in
          anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation cannot
          reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that time of trial, every soul must stand for himself before God.
          “Though Noah, Daniel, and Job” were in the land, “as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither
          son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.” Ezekiel 14:20.</p>
      <p>The last great conﬂict between truth and error is but the ﬁnal struggle of the <nobr>long-standing</nobr>
          controversy concerning the law of God. Upon this battle we are now <nobr>entering—a</nobr> battle between the
          laws of men and the precepts of Jehovah, between the religion of the Bible and the religion of fable and
          tradition.</p>
      <p>We should study the great waymarks that point out the times in which we are living.... We should now pray most
          earnestly that we may be prepared for the</p>
      <p>struggles of the great day of God’s preparation.</p>
      <p>Those who place themselves under God’s control, to be led and guided by Him, will catch the steady tread of the
          events ordained by Him to take place. Inspired with the Spirit of Him who gave His life for the life of the
          world, they will no longer stand still in impotency, pointing to what they cannot do. Putting on the armor of
          heaven, they will go forth to the warfare, willing to do and dare for God, knowing that His omnipotence will
          supply their need.</p>
