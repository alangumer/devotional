    <h1>Chap. 327—The Millennial Judgment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 1 Corinthians
          6:3.</strong></p>
      <p>During the thousand years between the ﬁrst and the second resurrection the judgment of the wicked takes place.
          The apostle Paul points to this judgment as an event that follows the second advent. “Judge nothing before the
          time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest
          the counsels of the hearts.” 1 Corinthians 4:5. Daniel declares that when the Ancient of Days came, “judgment
          was given to the saints of the most High.” Daniel 7:22. At this time the righteous reign as kings and priests
          unto God. John in the Revelation says: “I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto
          them.” “They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” Revelation
          20:4, 6. It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul, “the saints shall judge the world.” 1 Corinthians 6:2.
          In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and
          deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked must suffer is
          meted out, according to their works; and it is recorded against their names in the book of death.</p>
      <p>Satan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His people. Says Paul: “Know ye not that we shall judge
          angels?” Verse 3. And Jude declares that “the angels which kept not their ﬁrst estate, but left their own
          habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.” Jude
          6.</p>
      <p>At the close of the thousand years the second resurrection will take place. Then the wicked will be raised from
          the dead and appear before God for the execution of “the judgment written.” Thus the revelator, after
          describing the resurrection of the righteous, says: “The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
          years were ﬁnished.” Revelation 20:5. And Isaiah declares, concerning the wicked: “They shall be gathered
          together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall
          they be visited.” Isaiah 24:22.</p>
