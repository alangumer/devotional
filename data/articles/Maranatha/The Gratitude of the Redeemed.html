    <h1>Chap. 309—The Gratitude of the Redeemed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
          the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Matthew 25:40.</strong></p>
      <p>Every action of ours in befriending God’s people will be rewarded as done unto Himself.</p>
      <p>What satisfaction will every reaper have, when the clear, musical voice of Jesus shall be heard, saying, “Come,
          ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” “Enter thou
          into the joy of thy lord.”</p>
      <p>The Redeemer is gloriﬁed because He has not died in vain. With glad, rejoicing hearts, those who have been
          colaborers with God see of the travail of their soul for perishing, dying sinners, and are satisﬁed. The
          anxious hours they have spent, the perplexing circumstances they have had to meet, the sorrow of heart because
          some refused to see and receive the things which make for their peace, are forgotten. The
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> they have practiced in order to support the work, is remembered no more. As they look
          upon the souls they sought to win to Jesus, and see them saved, eternally <nobr>saved—monuments</nobr> of
          God’s mercy and of a Redeemer’s <nobr>love—there</nobr> ring through the arches of heaven shouts of praise and
          thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>There is a heaven before us, and among its inhabitants there will be no strife....</p>
      <p>We shall greet the holy family of the redeemed, and hear the words of Christ, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,
          inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” We shall touch our golden harps, and
          heaven will ring with rich music. We shall cast our glittering crowns at His feet, and give glory to Him who
          has overcome in our behalf.</p>
      <p>There may be some things here that we do not understand. Some things in the Bible may appear to us mysterious,
          because they are beyond our ﬁnite comprehension. But as our Saviour leads us by the living waters, He will
          make clear to our minds that which was not before clearly understood.</p>
