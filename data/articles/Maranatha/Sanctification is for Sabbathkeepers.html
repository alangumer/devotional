      <p><strong>Sabbathkeepers</strong></p>
      <p>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.... The seventh day is the sabbath of</p>
      <p>the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work. Exodus <nobr>20:8-10.</nobr></p>
      <p>God has declared in His Word that the seventh day is a sign between Him and His chosen <nobr>people—a</nobr>
          sign of their loyalty....</p>
      <p>The seventh day is God’s chosen day. He has not left this matter to be remodeled by priest or ruler. It is of
          too great importance to be left to human judgment. God saw that men would study their own convenience, and
          choose a day best suited to their inclinations, a day bearing no divine authority; and He has stated plainly
          that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Every man in God’s world is under the laws of His government. God has placed the Sabbath in the bosom of the
          Decalogue, and has made it the criterion of obedience. Through it we may learn of His power, as displayed in
          His works and His Word....</p>
      <p>Men could not place themselves more decidedly in opposition to God’s work and to His law than by upholding a
          day that is without one evidence of sanctity, and professing to worship Him on that day. Those who have
          corrupted the law by substituting a false sabbath for the holy Sabbath of God, and who compel the observance
          of this false sabbath, exalt themselves above God, and honor the spurious above the genuine.</p>
      <p>Sanctiﬁcation is claimed by professed Christians who ignore God’s holy rest day for a spurious sabbath. But God
          declares that the sanctiﬁcation coming from Him is bestowed on those only who honor Him by obeying His
          commands. The sanctiﬁcation claimed by those who continue in transgression is a spurious sanctiﬁcation. Thus
          the religious world is deceived by the enemy of God and man....</p>
      <p>Men have sought out many inventions. They have taken a common day, upon which God has placed no sanctity, and
          have clothed it with sacred prerogatives. They have declared it to be a holy day, but this does not give it a
          vestige of sanctity. They dishonor God by accepting human institutions and presenting to the world as the
          Christian Sabbath a day which has no “Thus saith the Lord” for its authority.</p>
