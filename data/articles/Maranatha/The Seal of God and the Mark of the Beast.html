    <h1>Chap. 203—The Seal of God and the Mark of the Beast</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. Isaiah 8:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The living righteous will receive the seal of God prior to the close of probation. The sign, or seal, of God is
          revealed in the observance of the <nobr>seventh-day</nobr> Sabbath, the Lord’s memorial of creation.... The
          mark of the beast is the opposite</p>
      <p>of <nobr>this—the</nobr> observance of the ﬁrst day of the week.</p>
      <p>Sundaykeeping is not yet the mark of the beast, and will not be until the decree goes forth causing men to
          worship this idol sabbath. The time will come when this day will be the test, but that time has not come
          yet.</p>
      <p>No one has yet received the mark of the beast. The testing time has not yet come. There are true Christians in
          every church, not excepting the Roman Catholic communion. None are condemned until they have had the light and
          have seen the obligation of the fourth commandment. But when the decree shall go forth enforcing the
          counterfeit sabbath, and the loud cry of the third angel shall warn men against the worship of the beast and
          his image, the line will be clearly drawn between the false and the true. Then those who still continue in
          transgression will receive the mark of the beast.</p>
      <p>If the light of truth has been presented to you, revealing the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and showing
          that there is no foundation in the Word of God for Sunday observance, and yet you still cling to the false
          sabbath, refusing to keep holy the Sabbath which God calls “my holy day,” you receive the mark of the beast.
          When does this take place? When you obey the decree that commands you to cease from labor on Sunday and
          worship God, while you know that there is not a word in the Bible showing Sunday to be other than a common
          working day, you consent to receive the mark of the beast, and refuse the seal of God.</p>
      <p>In a little while every one who is a child of God will have His seal placed upon him. O that it may be placed
          upon our foreheads! Who can endure the thought of being passed by when the angel goes forth to seal the
          servants of God in their foreheads?</p>
