    <h1>Chap. 354—Our Saviour’s Highest Honor</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with
          which I was wounded in the house of my friends. Zechariah 13:6.</strong></p>
      <p>“I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the ﬁrst heaven and the ﬁrst earth were passed away.” Revelation 21:1.
          The ﬁre that consumes the wicked puriﬁes the earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away....</p>
      <p>One reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of His cruciﬁxion. Upon His wounded head,
          upon His side, His hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. Says the
          prophet, beholding Christ in His glory: “He had bright beams coming out of his side: and there was the hiding
          of his power.” Habakkuk 3:4, margin. That pierced side whence ﬂowed the crimson stream that reconciled man to
          <nobr>God—there</nobr> is the Saviour’s glory, there “the hiding of his power.” ... And the tokens of His
          humiliation are His highest honor; through the eternal ages the wounds of Calvary will show forth His praise
          and declare His power.</p>
      <p>The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the redeemed through all eternity. In Christ gloriﬁed
          they will behold Christ cruciﬁed. Never will it be forgotten that He whose power created and upheld the
          unnumbered worlds through the vast realms of space, the Beloved of God, the Majesty of heaven, He whom cherub
          and shining seraph delighted to <nobr>adore—humbled</nobr> Himself to uplift fallen man; that He bore the
          guilt and shame of sin, and the hiding of His Father’s face, till the woes of a lost world broke His heart and
          crushed out His life on Calvary’s cross. That the Maker of all worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies, should
          lay aside His glory and humiliate Himself from love to man will ever excite the wonder and adoration of the
          universe. As the nations of the saved look upon their Redeemer and behold the eternal glory of the Father
          shining in His countenance; as they behold His throne, which is from everlasting to everlasting, and know that
          His kingdom is to have no end, they break forth in rapturous song: “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain,
          and hath redeemed us to God by His own most precious blood!”</p>
