    <h1>Chap. 121—God will Guide His People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not
          overﬂow thee: when thou walkest through the ﬁre, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the ﬂame kindle upon
          thee. Isaiah 43:2.</strong></p>
      <p>God has a church upon the earth, who are His chosen people, who keep His commandments. He is leading, not stray
          offshoots, not one here and one there, but a people.</p>
      <p>There is no need to doubt, to be fearful that the work will not succeed. God is at the head of the work, and He
          will set everything in order. If matters need adjusting at the head of the work, God will attend to that, and
          work to right every wrong. Let us have faith that God is going to carry the noble ship which bears the people
          of God safely into port.</p>
      <p>When I voyaged from Portland, Maine, to Boston, many years ago, a storm came upon us, and the great waves
          dashed us to and fro. The chandeliers fell, and the trunks were rolled from side to side, like balls. The
          passengers were frightened, and many were screaming, waiting in expectation of death.</p>
      <p>After a while the pilot came on board. The captain stood near the pilot as he took the wheel, and expressed
          fear about the course in which the ship was directed. “Will you take the wheel?” asked the pilot. The captain
          was not ready to do that, for he knew that he lacked experience. Then some of the passengers grew uneasy, and
          said they feared the pilot would dash them upon the rocks. “Will you take the wheel?” asked the pilot; but
          they knew that they could not manage the wheel.</p>
      <p>When you think that the work is in danger, pray, “Lord, stand at the wheel. Carry us through the perplexity.
          Bring us safely into port.” Have we not reason to believe that the Lord will bring us through triumphantly?
          ...</p>
      <p>You cannot with your ﬁnite minds understand the working of all the providences of God. Let God take care of His
          own work.</p>
