    <h1>Chap. 23—Intolerance and Persecution</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep
          your’s also. John 15:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Persecution in its varied forms is the development of a principle which will exist as long as Satan exists and
          Christianity has vital power. No man can serve God without enlisting against himself the opposition of the
          hosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his inﬂuence is taking the prey from their hands.
          Evil men, rebuked by his example, will unite with them in seeking to separate him from God by alluring
          temptations. When these do not succeed, then a compelling power is employed to force the conscience.</p>
      <p>But so long as Jesus remains man’s intercessor in the sanctuary above, the restraining inﬂuence of the Holy
          Spirit is felt by rulers and people. It still controls to some extent the laws of the land. Were it not for
          these laws, the condition of the world would be much worse than it now is. While many of our rulers are active
          agents of Satan, God also has His agents among the leading men of the nation. The enemy moves upon his
          servants to propose measures that would greatly impede the work of God; but statesmen who fear the Lord are
          inﬂuenced by holy angels to oppose such propositions with unanswerable arguments. Thus a few men will hold in
          check a powerful current of evil. The opposition of the enemies of truth will be restrained that the third
          angel’s message may do its work. When the ﬁnal warning shall be given, it will arrest the attention of these
          leading men through whom the Lord is now working, and some of them will accept it, and will stand with the
          people of God through the time of trouble....</p>
      <p>“Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God....” Joel</p>
      <p>2:23. “In the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all ﬂesh.” “And it shall come to pass,
          that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Acts 2:17, 21.</p>
      <p>The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its
          opening.</p>
