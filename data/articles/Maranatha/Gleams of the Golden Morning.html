    <h1>Chap. 280—Gleams of the Golden Morning</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming
          of the Son of man be. Matthew 24:27.</strong></p>
      <p>While all the world is plunged in darkness, there will be light in every dwelling of the saints. They will
          catch the ﬁrst light of His second appearing.</p>
      <p>Soon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about half the size of a man’s hand. It is the cloud which
          surrounds the Saviour and which seems in the distance to be shrouded in darkness. The people of God know this
          to be the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence they gaze upon it as it draws nearer the earth, becoming
          lighter and more glorious, until it is a great white cloud, its base a glory like consuming ﬁre, and above it
          the rainbow of the covenant. Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now a “man of sorrows,” to drink the
          bitter cup of shame and woe, He comes, victor in heaven and earth, to judge the living and the dead. “Faithful
          and True,” “in righteousness he doth judge and make war.” And “the armies which were in heaven” (Revelation
          19:11, 14) follow Him. With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him
          on His way. The ﬁrmament seems ﬁlled with radiant <nobr>forms—“ten</nobr> thousand times ten thousand, and
          thousands of thousands.” No human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate to conceive its
          splendor. “His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the
          light.” Habakkuk 3:3, 4. As the living cloud comes still nearer, every eye beholds the Prince of life. No
          crown of thorns now mars that sacred head; but a diadem of glory rests on His holy brow. His countenance
          outshines the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun. “And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name
          written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.” Revelation 19:16.</p>
      <p>With uplifted heads, with the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shining upon them, with rejoicing that
          their redemption draweth nigh, they [the living saints], go forth to meet the Bridegroom, saying. “Lo, this is
          our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us.”</p>
