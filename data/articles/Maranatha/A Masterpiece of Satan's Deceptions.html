    <h1>Chap. 127—A Masterpiece of Satan’s Deceptions</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and
          to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. Deuteronomy 29:29.</strong></p>
      <p>Human knowledge of both material and spiritual things is partial and imperfect; therefore many are unable to
          harmonize their views of science with Scripture statements. Many accept mere theories and speculations as
          scientiﬁc facts, and they think that God’s word is to be tested by the teachings of “science falsely so
          called.” 1 Timothy 6:20. The Creator and His works are beyond their comprehension; and because they cannot
          explain these by natural laws, Bible history is regarded as unreliable. Those who doubt the reliability of the
          records of the Old and New Testaments too often go a step further and doubt the existence of God and attribute
          inﬁnite power to nature. Having let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks of
          inﬁdelity.</p>
      <p>Thus many err from the faith and are seduced by the devil.... Human philosophy</p>
      <p>has attempted to search out and explain mysteries which will never be revealed through the eternal ages. If men
          would but search and understand what God has made known of Himself and His purposes, they would obtain such a
          view of the glory, majesty, and power of Jehovah that they would realize their own littleness and would be
          content with that which has been revealed....</p>
      <p>It is a masterpiece of Satan’s deceptions to keep the minds of men searching and conjecturing in regard to that
          which God has not made known and which He does not intend that we shall understand. It was thus that Lucifer
          lost his place in heaven. He became dissatisﬁed because all the secrets of God’s purposes were not conﬁded to
          him, and he entirely disregarded that which was revealed concerning his own work in the lofty position
          assigned him. By arousing the same discontent in the angels under his command, he caused their fall. Now he
          seeks to imbue the minds of men with the same spirit and to lead them also to disregard the direct commands of
          God.</p>
