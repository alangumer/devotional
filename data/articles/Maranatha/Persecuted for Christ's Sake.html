    <h1>Chap. 187—Persecuted for Christ’s Sake</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 2 Timothy 3:12. As Christ was hated
          without cause, so will His people be hated because they are obedient to the commandments of God. If He who was
          pure, holy, and undeﬁled, who did good and only good in our world, was treated as a base criminal and
          condemned to death, His disciples must expect but similar treatment, however</strong></p>
      <p>faultless may be their life and blameless their character.</p>
      <p>Human enactments, laws manufactured by satanic agencies under a plea of goodness and restriction of evil, will
          be exalted, while God’s holy commandments are despised and trampled underfoot. And all who prove their loyalty
          by obedience to the law of Jehovah must be prepared to be arrested, to be brought before councils that have
          not for their standard the high and holy law of God.</p>
      <p>Those who live during the last days of this earth’s history will know what it means to be persecuted for the
          truth’s sake. In the courts injustice will prevail. The judges will refuse to listen to the reasons of those
          who are loyal to the commandments of God, because they know that arguments in favor of the fourth commandment
          are unanswerable. They will say, “We have a law, and by our law he ought to die.” God’s law is nothing to
          them. “Our law” with them is supreme. Those who respect this human law will be favored, but those who will not
          bow to the idol sabbath will have no favors shown them.</p>
      <p>In summer there is no noticeable difference between evergreens and other trees; but when the blasts of winter
          come, the evergreens remain unchanged, while other trees are stripped of their foliage. So the falsehearted
          professor may not now be distinguished from the real Christian, but the time is just upon us when the
          difference will be apparent. Let opposition arise, let bigotry and intolerance again bear sway, let
          persecution be kindled, and the halfhearted and hypocritical will waver and yield the faith; but the true
          Christian will stand ﬁrm as a rock, his faith stronger, his hope brighter, than in days of prosperity.</p>
