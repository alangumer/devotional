    <h1>Chap. 85—Your Case Coming Up!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come. Revelation 14:7.</strong></p>
      <p>In 1844 our great High Priest entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, to begin the work of the
          investigative judgment.</p>
      <p>As the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all who have believed on Jesus come in review
          before God. Beginning with those who ﬁrst lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents the cases of each
          successive generation, and closes with the living. Every name is mentioned, every case closely investigated.
          Names are accepted, names rejected. When any have sins remaining upon the books of record, unrepented of and
          unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book of life....</p>
      <p>We are now living in the great day of atonement. In the typical service, while the high priest was making the
          atonement for Israel, all were required to afﬂict their souls by repentance of sin and humiliation before the
          Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In like manner, all who would have their names retained in
          the book of life, should now, in the few remaining days of their probation, afﬂict their souls before God by
          sorrow for sin and true repentance. There must be deep, faithful searching of heart.... There is earnest
          warfare before all who would subdue the evil</p>
      <p>tendencies that strive for the mastery. The work of preparation is an individual work. We are not saved in
          groups. The purity and devotion of one will not offset the want of these qualities in another.... Every one
          must be tested, and found without spot or</p>
      <p>wrinkle or any such thing.</p>
      <p>All who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood of Christ as their atoning sacriﬁce, have
          had pardon entered against their names in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers of the
          righteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be in harmony with the law of God, their sins will
          be blotted out, and they themselves will be accounted worthy of eternal life. The Lord declares,</p>
      <p>... “I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.”
          Isaiah 43:25.</p>
