    <h1>Chap. 191—Martyrs in the Last Days</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think
          that he doeth God service. John 16:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Every individual in our world will be arrayed under one of two banners.</p>
      <p>The two armies will stand distinct and separate, and this distinction will be so marked that many who shall be
          convinced of truth will come on the side of God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people. When this grand
          work is to take place in the battle, prior to the last closing conﬂict, many will be imprisoned, many will ﬂee
          for their lives from cities and towns, and many will be martyrs for Christ’s sake in standing in defense of
          the truth.</p>
      <p>By the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy in violation of the law of God, our nation [the United
          States] will disconnect herself fully from righteousness....</p>
      <p>As the approach of the Roman armies was a sign to the disciples of the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so
          may this apostasy be a sign to us that the limit of God’s forbearance is reached, that the measure of our
          nation’s iniquity is full, and that the angel of mercy is about to take her ﬂight, never to return. The people
          of God will then be plunged into those scenes of afﬂiction and distress which prophets have described as the
          time of Jacob’s trouble. The cries of the faithful, persecuted ones ascend to heaven. And as the blood of Abel
          cried from the ground, there are voices also crying to God from martyrs’ graves, from the sepulchers of the
          sea, from mountain caverns, from convents vaults: “How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and
          avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</p>
      <p>When the ﬁfth seal was opened, John the Revelator in vision saw beneath the altar the company that were slain
          for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. After this came the scenes described in the eighteenth
          of Revelation, when those who are faithful and true are called out from Babylon.</p>
      <p>Christ will restore the life taken; for He is the <nobr>Life-giver:</nobr> He will beautify the righteous with
          immortal life.</p>
