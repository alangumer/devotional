    <h1>Chap. 71—Joy in Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; and thy law is my delight. Psalm 119:174.</strong></p>
      <p>The true Christian will never complain that the yoke of Christ is galling to the neck. He accounts the service
          of Jesus as the truest freedom. The law of God is his delight. Instead of seeking to bring down the divine
          commands, to accord with his deﬁciencies, he is constantly striving to rise to the level of their
          perfection.</p>
      <p>Such an experience must be ours if we would be prepared to stand in the day of God. Now, while probation
          lingers, while mercy’s voice is still heard, is the time for us to put away our sins....</p>
      <p>God has made ample provision that we may stand perfect in His grace, wanting in nothing, waiting for the
          appearing of our Lord. Are you ready? Have you the wedding garment on? That garment will never cover deceit,
          impurity, corruption, or hypocrisy. The eye of God is upon you.... We may conceal our sins from the eyes</p>
      <p>of men, but we can hide nothing from our Maker.</p>
      <p>God spared not His own Son, but delivered Him to death for our offenses and raised Him again for our
          justiﬁcation. Through Christ we may present our petitions at the throne of Grace. Through Him, unworthy as we
          are, we may obtain all spiritual blessings. Do we come to Him, that we may have life?</p>
      <p>The will of God is expressed in the precepts of His holy law, and the principles of this law are the principles
          of heaven. The angels of heaven attain unto no higher knowledge than to know the will of God, and to do His
          will is the highest service that can engage their powers.</p>
      <p>But in heaven, service is not rendered in the spirit of legality. When Satan rebelled against the law of
          Jehovah, the thought that there was a law came to the angels almost as an awakening to something unthought of.
          In their ministry the angels are not as servants, but as sons.... Obedience is to them no drudgery. Love</p>
      <p>for God makes their service a joy. So in every soul wherein Christ, the hope of glory, dwells, His words are
          <nobr>re-echoed,</nobr> “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”</p>
