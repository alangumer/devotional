    <h1>Chap. 303—Our Redemption Draweth Nigh</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
          draweth nigh. Luke 21:28.</strong></p>
      <p>The coming of Christ is nearer than when we ﬁrst believed. The great controversy is nearing its end. The
          judgments of God are in the land. They speak in solemn warning, saying: “Be ye also ready: for in such an hour
          as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” Matthew 24:44....</p>
      <p>We are living in the closing scenes of this earth’s history. Prophecy is fast fulﬁlling. The hours of probation
          are fast passing. We have no <nobr>time—not</nobr> a <nobr>moment—to</nobr> lose. Let us not be found sleeping
          on guard. Let no one say in his heart or by his works: “My lord delayeth his coming.” Let the message of
          Christ’s soon return sound forth in earnest words of warning. Let us persuade men and women everywhere to
          repent and ﬂee from the wrath to come....</p>
      <p>The Lord is soon to come, and we must be prepared to meet Him in peace. Let us be determined to do all in our
          power to impart light to those around us. We are not to be sad, but cheerful, and we are to keep the Lord
          Jesus ever before us. He is soon coming, and we must be ready and waiting for His appearing. Oh, how glorious
          it will be to see Him and be welcomed as His redeemed ones! Long have we waited, but our hope is not to grow
          dim. If we can but see the King in His beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I must cry aloud:
          “Homeward bound!” We are nearing the time when Christ will come in power and great glory to take His ransomed
          ones to their eternal home....</p>
      <p>Long have we waited for our Saviour’s return. But nonetheless sure is the promise. Soon we shall be in our
          promised home. There Jesus will lead us beside the living stream ﬂowing from the throne of God and will
          explain to us the dark providences through which on this earth He brought us in order to perfect our
          characters. There we shall behold with undimmed vision the beauties of Eden restored. Casting at the feet of
          the Redeemer the crowns that He has placed on our heads, and touching our golden harps, we shall ﬁll all
          heaven with praise to Him that sitteth on the throne.</p>
