    <h1>Chap. 278—God’s Law Appears in the Heavens</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Psalm 50:6.</strong></p>
      <p>The clouds sweep back, and the starry heavens are seen, unspeakably glorious in contrast with the black and
          angry ﬁrmament on either side. The glory of the celestial city streams from the gates ajar.</p>
      <p>In the temple will be seen the ark of the testament in which were placed the two tables of stone, on which are
          written God’s law. These tables of stone will be brought forth from their hiding place, and on them will be
          seen the Ten Commandments engraved by the ﬁnger of God. These tables of stone now lying in the ark of the
          testament will be a convincing testimony to the truth and binding claims of God’s law.</p>
      <p>Sacrilegious minds and hearts have thought they were mighty enough to change the times and laws of Jehovah;
          but, safe in the archives of heaven, in the ark of God, are the original commandments, written upon the two
          tables of stone. No potentate of earth has power to draw forth those tables from their sacred hiding place
          beneath the mercy seat.</p>
      <p>There appears against the sky a hand holding two tables of stone folded together. Says the prophet: “The
          heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.” Psalm 50:6. That holy law, God’s
          righteousness, that amid thunder and ﬂame was proclaimed from Sinai as the guide of life, is now revealed to
          men as the rule of judgment. The hand opens the tables, and there are seen the precepts of the Decalogue,
          traced as with a pen of ﬁre. The words are so plain that all can read them. Memory is aroused, the darkness of
          superstition and heresy is swept from every mind, and God’s ten words, brief, comprehensive, and
          authoritative, are presented to the view of all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to describe the horror and despair of those who have trampled upon God’s holy
          requirements....</p>
      <p>The enemies of God’s law, from the ministers down to the least among them, have a new conception of truth and
          duty. Too late they see that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living God.</p>
