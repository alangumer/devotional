    <h1>Chap. 182—The Threefold Union of Religion</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of
          the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,
          which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great
          day of God Almighty. Revelation 16:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>By the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy in violation of the law of God, our nation [the United
          States] will disconnect herself fully from righteousness. When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the
          gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to clasp hands with
          spiritualism, when, under the inﬂuence of this threefold union, our country shall repudiate every principle of
          its Constitution as a Protestant and republican government, and shall make provision for the propagation of
          papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan and
          that the end is near.</p>
      <p>Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people
          under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of
          sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the
          gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power;
          and under the inﬂuence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on
          the rights of conscience....</p>
      <p>Papists, Protestants, and worldling will alike accept the form of godliness without the power, and they will
          see in this union a grand movement for the conversion of the world and the ushering in of the
          <nobr>long-expected</nobr> millennium.</p>
      <p>When our nation [the United States] shall so abjure the principles of its government as to enact a Sunday law,
          Protestantism will in this act join hands with popery; it will be nothing else than giving life to the tyranny
          which has long been eagerly watching its opportunity to spring again into active despotism.</p>
