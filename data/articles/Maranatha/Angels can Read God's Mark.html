    <h1>Chap. 235—Angels can Read God’s Mark</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a
          loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth,
          neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. Revelation
          7:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>Everything in the world is in an unsettled state. The nations are angry, and great preparations for war are
          being made. Nation is plotting against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. The great day of God is hasting
          greatly. But although the nations are mustering their forces for war and bloodshed, the command to the angels
          is still in force, that they hold the four winds until the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads.</p>
      <p>As yet the four winds are held until the servants of God shall be sealed in their foreheads. Then the powers of
          earth will marshal their forces for the last great battle. How carefully we should improve the little
          remaining period of our probation!</p>
      <p>Minds that have been given up to loose thought need to change.... The thoughts</p>
      <p>must be centered upon God. Now is the time to put forth earnest effort to overcome the natural tendencies of
          the carnal heart.</p>
      <p>Just before we entered it [the time of trouble], we all received the seal of the living God. Then I saw the
          four angels cease to hold the four winds. And I saw famine, pestilence and sword, nation rose against nation,
          and the whole world was in confusion.</p>
      <p>What is the seal of the living God, which is placed in the foreheads of His people? It is a mark which angels,
          but not human eyes, can read; for the destroying angel must see this mark of redemption. The intelligent mind
          has seen the sign of the cross of Calvary in the Lord’s adopted sons and daughters. The sin of the
          transgression of the law of God is taken away. They have on the wedding garment, and are obedient and faithful
          to all God’s commands.</p>
      <p>The Lord will not excuse those who know the truth if they do not in word and deed obey His commands.</p>
