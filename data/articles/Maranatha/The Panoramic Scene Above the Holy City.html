    <h1>Chap. 335—The Panoramic Scene Above the Holy City</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in
          his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Corinthians 5:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Above the throne is revealed the cross; and like a panoramic view appear the scenes of Adam’s temptation and
          fall, and the successive steps in the great plan of redemption. The Saviour’s lowly birth; His early life of
          simplicity and obedience; His baptism in Jordan; the fast and temptation in the wilderness; His public
          ministry, unfolding to men heaven’s most precious blessings; the days crowded with deeds of love and mercy,
          the nights of prayer and watching in the solitude of the mountains; the plottings of envy, hate, and malice
          which repaid His beneﬁts; the awful, mysterious agony in Gethsemane beneath the crushing weight of the sins of
          the whole world; His betrayal into the hands of the murderous mob; the fearful events of that night of
          <nobr>horror—the</nobr> unresisting prisoner, forsaken by His <nobr>best-loved</nobr> disciples, rudely
          hurried through the streets of Jerusalem; the Son of God exultingly displayed before Annas, arraigned in the
          high priest’s palace, in the judgment hall of Pilate, before the cowardly and cruel Herod, mocked, insulted,
          tortured, and condemned to <nobr>die—all</nobr> are vividly portrayed.</p>
      <p>And now before the swaying multitude are revealed the ﬁnal <nobr>scenes—the</nobr> patient Sufferer treading
          the path to Calvary; the Prince of heaven hanging upon the cross; the haughty priests and the jeering rabble
          deriding His expiring agony; the supernatural darkness; the heaving earth, the rent rocks, the open graves,
          marking the moment when the world’s Redeemer yielded up His life.</p>
      <p>The awful spectacle appears just as it was. Satan, his angels, and his subjects have no power to turn from the
          picture of their own work. Each actor recalls the part which he performed.... All behold the enormity of their
          guilt. They vainly seek</p>
      <p>to hide from the divine majesty of His countenance, outshining the glory of the sun, while the redeemed cast
          their crowns at the Saviour’s feet, exclaiming: “He died for me!”</p>
