    <h1>Chap. 349—The Immortal Inheritance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualiﬁed us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
          Colossians 1:12, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The ransom has been paid, and it is possible for all to come to God, and through a life of obedience to attain
          unto everlasting life. Then how sad it is that men turn from the immortal inheritance, and live for the
          gratiﬁcation of pride, for selﬁshness and display, and ... lose the blessing which they might have both in
          this life and in the life to come. They might enter into the palaces of heaven, and associate on terms of
          freedom and equality with Christ and heavenly angels, and with the princes of God; and yet, incredible as it
          may seem, they turn from heavenly attractions.</p>
      <p>The Creator of all worlds proposes to love those who believe in His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son as their
          personal Saviour, even as He loves His Son. Even here and now His gracious favor is bestowed upon us to this
          marvelous extent. He has given to men the gift of the Light and Majesty of heaven, and with Him He has
          bestowed all the treasures of heaven. Much as He has promised us for the life to come, He also bestows
          princely gifts upon us in this life, and as subjects of His grace, He would have us enjoy everything that will
          ennoble, expand, and elevate our characters. It is His design to ﬁt us for the heavenly courts above.</p>
      <p>But Satan is contending for the souls of men.... He would not have them catch</p>
      <p>a glimpse of the future honor, the eternal glories, laid up for those who shall be inhabitants of heaven, or
          have a taste of the experience that gives a foretaste of the happiness of heaven....</p>
      <p>Those who accept Christ as their Saviour have the promise of the life that now is, and that which is to
          come.... The lowliest disciple of Christ may become an</p>
      <p>inhabitant of heaven, an heir of God to an inheritance incorruptible, and that fadeth not away. O that every
          one might make choice of the heavenly gift, become an heir of God to that inheritance whose title is secure
          from any destroyer, world without end! O, choose not the world, but choose the better inheritance! Press, urge
          your way toward the mark for the prize of your high calling in Christ Jesus.</p>
