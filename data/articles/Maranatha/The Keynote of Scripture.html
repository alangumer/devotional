    <h1>Chap. 5—The Keynote of Scripture</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. Job
          19:25.</strong></p>
      <p>One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ’s second coming, to
          complete the great work of redemption. To God’s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn in “the region and
          shadow of death,” a precious, <nobr>joy-inspiring</nobr> hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who is
          “the resurrection and the life,” to “bring home again His banished.” The doctrine of the second advent is the
          very <nobr>key-note</nobr> of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the ﬁrst pair turned their sorrowing
          steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised One to break the destroyer’s
          power and bring them again to the lost Paradise. ... Enoch, only the seventh in descent from them that dwelt
          in Eden, he who for three centuries on earth walked with his God, was permitted to behold from afar the coming
          of the Deliverer. “Behold,” he declared, “the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute
          judgment upon all.” The patriarch Job in the night of his afﬂiction exclaimed with unshaken trust: “I know
          that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:... in my ﬂesh shall I see
          God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.”</p>
      <p>May the God of all grace so enlighten your understanding that you may discern eternal things, that by the light
          of truth your own errors, which are many, may be discovered to you just as they are, that you may make the
          necessary effort to put them away, and in the place of this evil, bitter fruit may bring forth fruit which is
          precious unto eternal life.</p>
      <p>Humble your poor, proud, <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> heart before God; get low, very low, all broken in your
          sinfulness at His feet. Devote yourself to the work of preparation. Rest not until you can truly say: My
          Redeemer liveth, and, because He lives, I shall live also.</p>
      <p>If you lose heaven, you lose everything; if you gain heaven, you gain everything. Do not make a mistake in this
          matter, I implore you. Eternal interests are here involved.</p>
