    <h1>Chap. 43—Dare you be Different?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew
          forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter
          2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The warning that the Son of man is soon to come in the clouds of heaven has become to many a familiar tale.
          They have left the waiting, watching position. The selﬁsh, worldly spirit manifested in the life reveals the
          sentiment of the heart, “My lord delayeth his coming.” ...</p>
      <p>The same spirit of selﬁshness, of conformity to the practices of the world, exists in our day as in Noah’s.
          Many who profess to be children of God follow their worldly pursuits with an intensity that gives the lie to
          their profession. They will be planting and building, buying and selling, eating and drinking, marrying and
          giving in marriage, up to the last moment of their probation. This is the condition of a large number of our
          own people....</p>
      <p>My soul is burdened as I see the great want of spirituality among us. The fashions and customs of the world,
          pride, love of amusement, love of display, extravagance in dress, in houses, in <nobr>lands—these</nobr> are
          robbing the treasury of God, turning to the gratiﬁcation of self the means which should be used to send forth
          the light of truth to the world....</p>
      <p>The children of the light and of the day are not to gather about them the shades of night and darkness which
          encompass the workers of iniquity. On the contrary, they are to stand faithfully at their post of duty as
          light bearers, gathering light from God to shed upon those in darkness. The Lord requires His people to
          maintain their integrity, touching <nobr>not—that</nobr> is, imitating <nobr>not—the</nobr> practices of the
          ungodly.</p>
      <p>Christians will be in this world “an holy nation, a peculiar people,” showing forth the praises of Him who hath
          called them “out of darkness into his marvellous light.” This light is not to grow dim, but to shine brighter
          and brighter unto the perfect day.... The thrilling truth that has been sounding in our ears for many
          years,</p>
      <p>“The Lord is at hand; be ye also ready,” is no less the truth today than when we ﬁrst heard the message.</p>
