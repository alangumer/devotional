    <h1>Chap. 133—Turmoil in the Cities</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 2 Timothy
          3:13.</strong></p>
      <p>It was not God’s purpose that His people should be crowded into cities, huddled together in terraces and
          tenements. In the beginning He placed our ﬁrst parents in a garden amidst the beautiful sights and attractive
          sounds of nature, and these sights and sounds He desires men to rejoice in today.</p>
      <p>Light has been given me that the cities will be ﬁlled with confusion, violence, and crime, and that these
          things will increase till the end of this earth’s history.</p>
      <p>It is time for our people to take their families from the cities into more retired localities, else many of the
          youth, and many also of those older in years, will be ensnared and taken by the enemy.</p>
      <p>“Out of the cities; out of the <nobr>cities!”—this</nobr> is the message the Lord has been giving me.</p>
      <p>The turmoil and confusion that ﬁll these cities, the conditions brought about by the labor unions and the
          strikes, would prove a great hindrance to our work. Men are seeking to bring those engaged in the different
          trades under bondage to certain unions. This is not God’s planning, but the planning of a power that we should
          in no wise acknowledge. God’s word is fulﬁlling; the wicked are binding themselves up in bundles ready to be
          burned.</p>
      <p>We are now to use all our entrusted capabilities in giving the last warning message to the world. In this work
          we are to preserve our individuality. We are not to unite with secret societies or with
          <nobr>trade-unions.</nobr> We are to stand free in God, looking constantly to Christ.</p>
      <p>The ungodly cities of our world are to be swept away by the besom of destruction. In the calamities that are
          now befalling immense buildings and large portions of cities God is showing us what will come upon the whole
          earth. He has told us: “Now learn a parable of the ﬁg tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth
          leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it [the
          coming of the Son of man] is near, even at the doors.” Matthew 24:32, 33.</p>
