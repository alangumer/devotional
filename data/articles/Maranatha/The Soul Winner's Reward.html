    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to
          righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. Daniel 12:3.</strong></p>
      <p>When I think of those words of Daniel, I ﬁnd myself waking up in the night and repeating them over and over:
          “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to righteousness
          as the stars for ever and ever.” Look at the sun and the stars marshaled in the heavens, and known by their
          names. The Lord says, They that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.</p>
      <p>In order to determine how important are the interests involved in the conversion of the soul from error to
          truth, we must appreciate the value of immortality; we must realize how terrible are the pains of the second
          death; we must comprehend the honor and glory awaiting the ransomed, and understand what it is to live in the
          presence of Him who died that He might elevate and ennoble man, and give to the overcomer a royal diadem.</p>
      <p>The worth of a soul cannot be fully estimated by ﬁnite minds. How gratefully will the ransomed and gloriﬁed
          ones remember those who were instrumental in their salvation! No one will then regret his
          <nobr>self-denying</nobr> efforts and persevering labors, his patience, forbearance, and earnest heart
          yearnings for souls that might have been lost had he neglected his duty or become weary in
          <nobr>well-doing.</nobr></p>
      <p>Now these <nobr>white-robed</nobr> ones are gathered into the fold of the Great Shepherd. The faithful worker
          and the soul saved through his labor are greeted by the Lamb in the midst of the throne, and are led to the
          tree of life and to the fountain of living waters. With what joy does the servant of Christ behold these
          redeemed ones, who are made to share the glory of the Redeemer! How much more precious is heaven to those who
          have been faithful in the work of saving souls! “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
          ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars.”</p>
      <p>What is done through the cooperation of men with God is a work that shall never perish, but endure through the
          eternal ages.</p>
