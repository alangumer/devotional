    <h1>Chap. 38—The Feast that Satisﬁes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be ﬁlled. Matthew
          5:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Let those men and women who are satisﬁed with their dwarfed, crippled condition in divine things be suddenly
          transported to heaven and for an instant witness the high, the holy state of perfection that ever abides
          <nobr>there—every</nobr> soul ﬁlled with love; every countenance beaming with joy; ... could such persons, I
          ask, mingle with the heavenly throng, participate in their songs, and endure the pure, exalted, transporting
          glory that emanates from God and the Lamb? Oh, no! ...</p>
      <p>Those who have trained the mind to delight in spiritual exercises are the ones who can be translated and not be
          overwhelmed with the purity and transcendent glory of heaven. You may have a good knowledge of the arts, you
          may have an acquaintance with the sciences, you may excel in music and in penmanship, your manners may please
          your associates, but what have these things to do with a preparation for heaven? What have they to do to
          prepare you to stand before the tribunal of God?</p>
      <p>Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Nothing but holiness will prepare you for heaven. It is sincere,
          experimental piety alone that can give you a pure, elevated character and enable you to enter into the
          presence of God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable. The heavenly character must be acquired on earth, or it
          can never be acquired at all.</p>
      <p>Desires for goodness and true holiness are right so far as they go; but if you stop here, they will avail
          nothing. Good purposes are right, but will prove of no avail unless resolutely carried out. Many will be lost
          while hoping and desiring to be Christians; but they made no earnest effort, therefore they will be weighed in
          the balances and found wanting. The will must be exercised in the right direction. I will be a wholehearted
          Christian. I will know the length and breadth, the height and depth, of perfect love.</p>
      <p>Listen to the words of Jesus: “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall
          be ﬁlled.” Ample provisions are made by Christ to satisfy the soul that hungers and thirsts for
          righteousness.</p>
