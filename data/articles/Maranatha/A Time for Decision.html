    <h1>Chap. 100—A Time for Decision!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Choose you this day whom ye will serve. Joshua 24:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Today the world is mad: an insanity is upon men and women, and is hurrying them on to eternal ruin. Every
          species of indulgence prevails, and men have become so infatuated with vice that they will not listen to
          warnings or appeals.</p>
      <p>The Lord says to the people of the earth, “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” All are now deciding their
          eternal destiny. Men need to be aroused to realize the solemnity of the time, the nearness of the day when
          human probation shall be ended. God gives no man a message that it will be ﬁve years or ten years or twenty
          years before this earth’s history shall close. He would not give any living being an excuse for delaying the
          preparation for His appearing. He would have no one say, as did the unfaithful servant, “My lord delayeth his
          coming;” for this leads to reckless neglect of the opportunities and privileges given to prepare us for that
          great day. Everyone who claims to be a servant of God is called to do His service as if each day might be the
          last....</p>
      <p>Talk of the speedy appearing of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. Put not off
          that day....</p>
      <p>Here is the great burden to be carried by each one. Are my sins forgiven? Has Christ, the
          <nobr>burden-bearer,</nobr> taken away my guilt? Have I a clean heart, puriﬁed by the righteousness of Jesus
          Christ? Woe be to any soul who is not seeking a refuge in Christ. Woe be to all who shall in any way divert
          the mind from the work, and cause any soul to be less vigilant now....</p>
      <p>The great work from which the mind should not be diverted is the consideration of our personal standing in the
          sight of God. Are our feet on the Rock of Ages? Are we hiding ourselves in the only Refuge? The storm is
          coming, relentless in its fury. Are we prepared to meet it? Are we one with Christ as He is one with the
          Father? Are we heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ? ...</p>
      <p>The character of Christ is to be our character. We are to be transformed by the renewing of our hearts. Here is
          our only safety. Nothing can separate a living Christian from God.</p>
