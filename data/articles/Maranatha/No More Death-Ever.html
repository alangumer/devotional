    <h1>Chap. 344—No More Death—Ever!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
          crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. Revelation
          21:4.</strong></p>
      <p>As we enter the kingdom of God, there to spend eternity, the trials and the difﬁculties and the perplexities
          that we have had here will sink into insigniﬁcance.</p>
      <p>In the home of the redeemed there will be no tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning, “The inhabitant
          shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” Isaiah 33:24. One
          rich tide of happiness will ﬂow and deepen as eternity rolls on....</p>
      <p>Let us consider most earnestly the blessed hereafter. Let our faith pierce through every cloud of darkness and
          behold Him who died for the sins of the world. He has opened the gates of paradise to all who receive and
          believe on Him. To them He gives power to become the sons and daughters of God. Let the afﬂictions which pain
          us so grievously become instructive lessons, teaching us to press forward toward the mark of the prize of our
          high calling in Christ. Let us be encouraged by the thought that the Lord is soon to come. Let this hope
          gladden our hearts....</p>
      <p>We are homeward bound. He who loved us so much as to die for us hath builded for us a city. The New Jerusalem
          is our place of rest. There will be no sadness in the city of God. No wail of sorrow, no dirge of crushed
          hopes and buried affections, will evermore be heard. Soon the garments of heaviness will be changed for the
          wedding garment. Soon we shall witness the coronation of our King. Those whose lives have been hidden with
          Christ, those who on this earth have fought the good ﬁght of faith, will shine forth with the Redeemer’s glory
          in the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>It will not be long till we shall see Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. And in His presence,
          all the trials and sufferings of this life will be as nothingness.... Look up, look up, and let your faith
          continually increase. Let this</p>
      <p>faith guide you along the narrow path that leads through the gates of the city of God into the great beyond,
          the wide, unbounded future of glory that is for the redeemed.</p>
