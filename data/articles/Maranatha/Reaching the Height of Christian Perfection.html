    <h1>Chap. 218—Reaching the Height of Christian Perfection</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the
          power that worketh in us. Ephesians 3:20.</strong></p>
      <p>If you make God your strength, you may, under the most discouraging circumstances, attain a height and breadth
          of Christian perfection which you hardly think it possible to reach Your thoughts may be elevated, you may
          have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, and purposes of action which shall raise you above all
          sordid motives.</p>
      <p>Both thought and action will be necessary if you would attain to perfection of character. While brought in
          contact with the world, you should be on your guard that you do not seek too ardently for the applause of men
          and live for their opinion....</p>
      <p>Cultivate the grace of humility, and hang your helpless souls upon Christ.... In</p>
      <p>the midst of confusion and temptation in the worldly crowd you may, with perfect sweetness, keep the
          independence of the soul.</p>
      <p>If you are in daily communion with God you will learn to place His estimate upon men, and the obligations
          resting upon you to bless suffering humanity will meet with a willing response. You are not your own; your
          Lord has sacred claims upon your supreme affections and the very highest services of your life. He has a right
          to use you, in your body and in your spirit, to the fullest extent of your capabilities, for His own honor and
          glory. Whatever crosses you may be required to bear, ... you are to accept without a murmur....</p>
      <p>Many are without God and without hope in the world. They are guilty, corrupt, and degraded, enslaved by Satan’s
          devices. Yet these are the ones whom Christ came from heaven to redeem. They are subjects for tenderest pity,
          sympathy, and tireless effort; for they are on the verge of ruin. They suffer from ungratiﬁed desires,
          disordered passions, and the condemnation of their own consciences; they are miserable in every sense of the
          word, for they are losing their hold on this life and have no prospect for the life to come.</p>
      <p>You have an important ﬁeld of labor, and you should be active and vigilant, rendering cheerful and unqualiﬁed
          obedience to the Master’s calls.</p>
