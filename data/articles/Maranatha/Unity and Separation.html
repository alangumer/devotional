    <h1>Chap. 194—Unity and Separation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Under the Loud Cry Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
          For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon
          thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Isaiah 60:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>As trials thicken around us, both separation and unity will be seen in our ranks. Some who are now ready to
          take up weapons of warfare will in times of real peril make it manifest that they have not built upon the
          solid rock; they will yield to temptation. Those who have had great light and precious privileges, but have
          not improved them, will, under one pretext or another, go out from us. Not having received the love of the
          truth, they will be taken in the delusions of the enemy; they will give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
          of devils, and will depart from the faith. But, on the other hand, when the storm of persecution really breaks
          upon us, the true sheep will hear the true Shepherd’s voice. <nobr>Self-denying</nobr> efforts will be put
          forth to save the lost, and many who have strayed from the fold will come back to follow the great Shepherd.
          The people of God will draw together and present to the enemy a united front. In view of the common peril,
          strife for supremacy will cease; there will be no disputing as to who shall be accounted greatest. No one of
          the true believers will say: “I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas.” The testimony of one and all
          will be: “I cleave unto Christ; I rejoice in Him as my personal Saviour.”</p>
      <p>As the third angel’s message swells into a loud cry, great power and glory will attend its proclamation. The
          faces of God’s people will shine with the light of heaven.</p>
      <p>Many of the rulers are those whom Satan controls; but... God has His agents, even among the rulers. And some of
          them will yet be converted to the truth....A few</p>
      <p>of God’s agents will have power to bear down a great mass of evil. Thus the work will go on until the third
          message has done its work, and at the loud cry of the third angel, these agents will have an opportunity to
          receive the truth, and some of them will be converted, and endure with the saints through the time of
          trouble.</p>
