    <h1>Chap. 101—Living to Save Others</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. Luke
          9:23.</strong></p>
      <p>The sin which is indulged to the greatest extent, and which separates us from God and produces so many
          contagious spiritual disorders, is selﬁshness. There can be no returning to the Lord except by
          <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> Of ourselves we can do nothing; but, through God strengthening us, we can live to do
          good to others, and in this way shun the evil of selﬁshness. We need not go to heathen lands to manifest our
          desire to devote all to God in a useful, unselﬁsh life. We should do this in the home circle, in the church,
          among those with whom we associate and with whom we do business. Right in the common walks of life is where
          self is to be denied and kept in subordination.</p>
      <p>Paul could say: “I die daily.” It is the daily dying to self in the little transactions of life that makes us
          overcomers. We should forget self in the desire to do good to others. With many there is a decided lack of
          love for others. Instead of faithfully performing their duty, they seek rather their own pleasure.</p>
      <p>God positively enjoins upon all His followers a duty to bless others with their inﬂuence and means, and to seek
          that wisdom of Him which will enable them to do all in their power to elevate the thoughts and affections of
          those who come within their inﬂuence. In doing for others, a sweet satisfaction will be experienced, an inward
          peace which will be a sufﬁcient reward. When actuated by a high and noble desire to do others good, they will
          ﬁnd true happiness in a faithful discharge of life’s manifold duties. This will bring more than an earthly
          reward; for every faithful, unselﬁsh performance of duty is noticed by the angels and shines in the life
          record.</p>
      <p>In heaven none will think of self, nor seek their own pleasure; but all, from pure, genuine love, will seek the
          happiness of the heavenly beings around them. If we wish to enjoy heavenly society in the earth made new, we
          must be governed by heavenly principles here.</p>
      <p>The greatest work that can be done in our world is to glorify God by living the character of Christ.</p>
