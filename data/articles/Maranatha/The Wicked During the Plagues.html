    <h1>Chap. 263—The Wicked During the Plagues</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of
          bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: and they shall wander from sea to sea,
          and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not ﬁnd
          it. Amos 8:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>And as mercy’s sweet voice died away, fear and horror seized the wicked. With terrible distinctness they heard
          the words, “Too late! too late!”</p>
      <p>Christ [on the cross] felt much as sinners will feel when the vials of God’s wrath shall be poured out upon
          them. Black despair like the pall of death will gather about their guilty souls, and then they will realize to
          the fullest extent the sinfulness of sin.</p>
      <p>Those who had not prized God’s Word were hurrying to and fro, wandering from sea to sea, and from the north to
          the east, to seek the Word of the Lord. Said the angel, “They shall not ﬁnd it. There is a famine in the land;
          not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord. What would they not give
          for one word of approval from God! ...</p>
      <p>Many of the wicked were greatly enraged as they suffered the effects of the plagues. It was a scene of fearful
          agony. Parents were bitterly reproaching their children, and children their parents, brothers their sisters,
          and sisters their brothers....</p>
      <p>The people turned upon their ministers with bitter hate and reproached them, saying, “You have not warned us.
          You told us that all the world was to be converted, and cried, Peace, peace, to quiet every fear that was
          aroused. You have not told us of this hour; and those who warned us of it you declared to be fanatics and evil
          men, who would ruin us.” But I saw that the ministers did not escape the wrath of God. Their suffering was
          tenfold greater than that of their people.</p>
      <p>In the time when God’s judgments are falling without mercy, oh, how enviable to the wicked will be the position
          of those who abide “in the secret place of the most <nobr>High”—the</nobr> pavilion in which the Lord hides
          all who have loved Him and have obeyed His commandments!</p>
