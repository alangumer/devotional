    <h1>Chap. 175—Forbidden to Buy or Sell</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number
          of his name. Revelation 13:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The time is coming when we cannot sell at any price. The decree will soon go forth prohibiting men to buy or
          sell of any man save him that hath the mark of the beast.</p>
      <p>In the last great conﬂict of the controversy with Satan those who are loyal to God will see every earthly
          support cut off. Because they refuse to break His law in obedience to earthly powers, they will be forbidden
          to buy or sell.</p>
      <p>Religious powers, allied to heaven by profession, and claiming to have the characteristics of a lamb, will show
          by their acts that they have the heart of a dragon and that they are instigated and controlled by Satan. The
          time is coming when God’s people will feel the hand of persecution because they keep holy the seventh
          day.</p>
      <p>There is a time coming when <nobr>commandment-keepers</nobr> can neither buy nor sell. Make haste to dig out
          your buried talents. If God has intrusted you with money, show yourselves faithful to your trust; unwrap your
          napkin, and send your talents to the exchangers, that when Christ shall come, He may receive His own with
          interest. In the last extremity, before this work shall close, thousands will be cheerfully laid upon the
          altar. Men and women will feel it a blessed privilege to share in the work of preparing souls to stand in the
          great day of God, and they will give hundreds as readily as dollars are given now. If the love of Christ were
          burning in the hearts of His professed people, we would see the same spirit manifested today. Did they but
          realize how near is the end of all work for the salvation of souls, they would sacriﬁce their possessions as
          freely as did the members of the early church. They would work for the advancement of God’s cause as earnestly
          as worldly men labor to acquire riches. Tact and skill would be exercised, and earnest and unselﬁsh labor put
          forth to acquire means, not to hoard, but to pour into the treasury of the Lord.</p>
