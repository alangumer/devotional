    <h1>Chap. 37—Ready to Answer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh
          you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. 1 Peter 3:15.</strong></p>
      <p>I have been shown that many who profess to have a knowledge of present truth know not what they believe. They
          do not understand the evidences of their faith. They have no just appreciation of the work for the present
          time. When the time of trial shall come, there are men now preaching to others who will ﬁnd, upon examining
          the positions they hold, that there are many things for which they can give no satisfactory reason. Until thus
          tested they know not their great ignorance. And there are many in the church who take it for granted that they
          understand what they believe; but, until controversy arises, they do not know their own weakness. When
          separated from those of like faith and compelled to stand singly and alone to explain their belief, they will
          be surprised to see how confused are their ideas of what they had accepted as truth....</p>
      <p>God will arouse His people; if other means fail, heresies will come in among them, which will sift them,
          separating the chaff from the wheat. The Lord calls upon all who believe His word to awake out of sleep.
          Precious light has come, appropriate for this time.... Believers are not to rest in suppositions and
          <nobr>ill-deﬁned</nobr></p>
      <p>ideas of what constitutes truth. Their faith must be ﬁrmly founded upon the word of God so that when the
          testing time shall come and they are brought before councils to answer for their faith they may be able to
          give a reason for the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear.</p>
      <p>The servants of Christ are to prepare no set speech to present when brought to trial for their faith. Their
          preparation is to be made day by day, in treasuring up in their hearts the precious truths of God’s word, in
          feeding upon the teaching of Christ, and through prayer strengthening their faith; then, when brought into
          trial, the Holy Spirit will bring to their remembrance the very truths that will reach the hearts of those who
          shall come to hear.</p>
      <p>God will ﬂash the knowledge obtained by diligent searching of the Scriptures, into their memory at the very
          time when it is needed.</p>
