    <h1>Chap. 270—God’s People Delivered</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible
          shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
          Isaiah 49:25.</strong></p>
      <p>When the protection of human laws shall be withdrawn from those who honor the law of God, there will be, in
          different lands, a simultaneous movement for their destruction. As the time appointed in the decree draws
          near, the people will conspire to root out the hated sect. It will be determined to strike in one night a
          decisive blow, which shall utterly silence the voice of dissent and reproof.</p>
      <p>The people of <nobr>God—some</nobr> in prison cells, some hidden in solitary retreats in the forests and the
          <nobr>mountains—still</nobr> plead for divine protection, while in every quarter companies of armed men, urged
          on by hosts of evil angels, are preparing for the work of death. It is now, in the hour of utmost extremity,
          that the God of Israel will interpose for the deliverance of His chosen....</p>
      <p>With shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs of evil men are about to rush upon their prey, when,
          lo, a dense blackness, deeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the earth. Then a rainbow, shining
          with the glory from the throne of God, spans the heavens and seems to encircle each praying company. The angry
          multitudes are suddenly arrested. Their mocking cries die away. The objects of their murderous rage are
          forgotten. With fearful forebodings they gaze upon the symbol of God’s covenant and long to be shielded from
          its overpowering brightness.</p>
      <p>By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard saying, “Look up,” and lifting their eyes to the
          heavens, they behold the bow of promise. The black, angry clouds that covered the ﬁrmament are parted, and
          like Stephen they look up steadfastly into heaven and see the glory of God and the Son of man seated upon His
          throne.</p>
      <p>While all the world is plunged in darkness, there will be light in every dwelling of the saints. They will
          catch the ﬁrst light of His second appearing.</p>
