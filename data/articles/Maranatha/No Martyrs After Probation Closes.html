    <h1>Chap. 269—No Martyrs After Probation Closes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and
          honour him. Psalm 91:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while persecuted and distressed, while they endure
          privation and suffer for want of food they will not be left to perish....</p>
      <p>Yet to human sight it will appear that the people of God must soon seal their testimony with their blood as did
          the martyrs before them. They themselves begin to fear that the Lord has left them to fall by the hand of
          their enemies. It is a time of fearful agony. Day and night they cry unto God for deliverance....</p>
      <p>The eye of God, looking down the ages, was ﬁxed upon the crisis which His people are to meet, when earthly
          powers shall be arrayed against them. Like the captive exile, they will be in fear of death by starvation or
          by violence. But the Holy One who divided the Red Sea before Israel, will manifest His mighty power and turn
          their captivity. “They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I
          will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.” Malachi 3:17. If the blood of Christ’s
          faithful witnesses were shed at this time, it would not, like the blood of the martyrs, be as seed sown to
          yield a harvest for God. Their ﬁdelity would not be a testimony to convince others of the truth; for the
          obdurate heart has beaten back the waves of mercy until they return no more. If the righteous were now left to
          fall a prey to their enemies, it would be a triumph for the prince of darkness. Says the psalmist: “In the
          time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me.” Psalm
          27:5. Christ has spoken: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide
          thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of
          his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.” Isaiah 26:20, 21. Glorious will be the
          deliverance of those who have patiently waited for His coming and whose names are written in the book of
          life.</p>
