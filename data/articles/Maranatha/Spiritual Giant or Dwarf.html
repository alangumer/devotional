    <h1>Chap. 45—Spiritual Giant or Dwarf?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all ﬁlthiness of the
          ﬂesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. 2 Corinthians 7:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord reproves and corrects the people who profess to keep His law. He points out their sins and lays open
          their iniquity because He wishes to separate all sin and wickedness from them, that they may perfect holiness
          in His fear and be prepared to die in the Lord or to be translated to heaven....</p>
      <p>God will accept nothing but purity and holiness; one spot, one wrinkle, one defect in the character, will
          forever debar them from heaven, with all its glories and treasures.</p>
      <p>Most professed Christians have no sense of the spiritual strength they might obtain were they as ambitious,
          zealous, and persevering to gain a knowledge of divine things as they are to obtain the paltry, perishable
          things of this life. The masses professing to be Christians have been satisﬁed to be spiritual dwarfs. They
          have no disposition to make it their object to seek ﬁrst the kingdom of God and His righteousness; hence
          godliness is a hidden mystery to them, they cannot understand it. They know not Christ by experimental
          knowledge.</p>
      <p>Ample provisions have been made for all who sincerely, earnestly, and thoughtfully set about the work of
          perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Strength, grace, and glory have been provided through Christ, to be
          brought by ministering angels to the heirs of salvation. None are so low, so corrupt and vile, that they
          cannot ﬁnd in Jesus, who died for them, strength, purity, and righteousness, if they will put away their sins,
          cease their course of iniquity, and turn with full purpose of heart to the living God. He is waiting to strip
          them of their garments, stained and polluted by sin, and to put upon them the white, bright robes of
          righteousness; and He bids them live and not die. In Him they may ﬂourish. Their branches will not wither nor
          be fruitless. If they abide in Him, they can draw sap and nourishment from Him, be imbued with His Spirit,
          walk even as He walked, overcome as He overcame, and be exalted to His own right hand.</p>
