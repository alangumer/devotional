    <h1>Chap. 172—The Sign to Leave Large Cities</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in
          the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judaea ﬂee into the mountains.
          Matthew 24:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we shall be forced to seek a refuge in desolate
          and solitary places. As the siege of Jerusalem by the Roman armies was the signal for ﬂight to the Judean
          Christians, so the assumption of power on the part of our nation [the United States] in the decree enforcing
          the papal sabbath will be a warning to us. It will then be time to leave the large cities, preparatory to
          leaving the smaller ones for retired homes in secluded places among the mountains.</p>
      <p>For years I have been given special light that we are not to center our work in the cities. The turmoil and
          confusion that ﬁll these cities, the conditions brought about by the labor unions and the strikes, would prove
          a great hindrance to our work. Men are seeking to bring those engaged in the different trades under bondage to
          certain unions. This is not God’s planning, but the planning of a power that we should in no wise acknowledge.
          God’s Word is fulﬁlling; the wicked are binding themselves up in bundles ready to be burned.</p>
      <p>The trades unions and confederacies of the world are a snare. Keep out of them, and away from them, brethren.
          Have nothing to do with them. Because of these unions and confederacies, it will soon be very difﬁcult for our
          institutions to carry on their work in the cities.... Educate our people to get out of the cities into the
          country,</p>
      <p>where they can obtain a small piece of land, and make a home for themselves and their children....</p>
      <p>Erelong there will be such strife and confusion in the cities, that those who wish to leave them will not be
          able.</p>
      <p>We are not to locate ourselves where we will be forced into close relations with those who do not honor God....
          A crisis is soon to come in regard to the observance</p>
      <p>of Sunday....</p>
      <p>The Sunday party is strengthening itself in its false claims, and this will mean oppression to those who
          determine to keep the Sabbath of the Lord....</p>
      <p>If in the providence of God we can secure places away from the cities, the Lord would have us do this. There
          are troublous times before us.</p>
