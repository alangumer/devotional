    <h1>Chap. 226—Drums, Dancing and Noise</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let all things be done decently and in order. 1 Corinthians 14:40.</strong></p>
      <p>The things you have described ... the Lord has shown me would take place just before the close of probation.
          Every uncouth thing will be demonstrated. There will be shouting, with drums, music, and dancing. The senses
          of rational beings will become so confused that they cannot be trusted to make right decisions. And this is
          called the moving of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit never reveals itself in such methods, in such a bedlam of noise. This is an invention of Satan
          to cover up his ingenious methods for making of none effect the pure, sincere, elevating, ennobling,
          sanctifying truth for this time.... A</p>
      <p>bedlam of noise shocks the senses and perverts that which if conducted aright might be a blessing. The powers
          of Satanic agencies blend with the din and noise, to have a carnival, and this is termed the Holy Spirit’s
          working.... Those participating in the</p>
      <p>supposed revival receive impressions which lead them adrift. They cannot tell what they formerly knew regarding
          Bible principles.</p>
      <p>No encouragement should be given to this kind of worship. The same kind of inﬂuence came in after the passing
          of the time in 1844. The same kind of representations were made. Men became excited, and were worked by a
          power thought to be the power of God....</p>
      <p>Men and women, supposed to be guided by the Holy Spirit, held meetings in a state of nudity. They talked about
          holy ﬂesh. They said they were beyond the power of temptation, and they sang, and shouted, and made all manner
          of noisy demonstrations.... Satan was moulding the work, and sensuality was the result. The</p>
      <p>cause of God was dishonored. Truth, sacred truth, was leveled in the dust by human agencies....</p>
      <p>I bore my testimony, declaring that these fanatical movements, this din and noise, were inspired by the spirit
          of Satan, who was working miracles to deceive if possible the very elect.</p>
      <p>We need to be on our guard, to maintain a close connection with Christ, that we be not deceived by Satan’s
          devices. The Lord desires to have in His service order and discipline, not excitement and confusion.</p>
