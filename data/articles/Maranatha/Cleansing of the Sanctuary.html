    <h1>Chap. 240—Cleansing of the Sanctuary</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and
          came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. Daniel 7:13.</strong></p>
      <p>After His ascension, our Saviour began His work as our high priest. Says Paul, “Christ is not entered into the
          holy places made with hands, which are the ﬁgures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the
          presence of God for us.” Hebrews 9:24....</p>
      <p>For eighteen centuries this work of ministration continued in the ﬁrst apartment of the sanctuary. The blood of
          Christ, pleaded in behalf of penitent believers, secured their pardon and acceptance with the Father, yet
          their sins still remained upon the books of record. As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at
          the close of the year, so before Christ’s work for the redemption of men is completed, there is a work of
          atonement for the removal of sin from the sanctuary. This is the service which began when the 2300 days ended.
          At that time ... our High Priest entered the most holy, to perform the last division of His solemn
          <nobr>work—to</nobr> cleanse the sanctuary....</p>
      <p>The coming of Christ as our high priest to the most holy place, for the cleansing of the sanctuary, brought to
          view in Daniel 8:14; the coming of the Son of man to the Ancient of days, as presented in Daniel 7:13; and the
          coming of the Lord to His temple, foretold by Malachi, are descriptions of the same event; and this is also
          represented by the coming of the bridegroom to the marriage, described by Christ in the parable of the ten
          virgins, of Matthew 25.</p>
      <p>The cleansing of the sanctuary ... involves a work of <nobr>investigation—a</nobr> work of judgment. This work
          must be performed prior to the coming of Christ to redeem His people; for when He comes, His reward is with
          Him to give to every man according to his works.</p>
      <p>In the day of ﬁnal reckoning, position, rank, or wealth will not alter by a hair’s breadth the case of any one.
          By the <nobr>all-seeing</nobr> God, men will be judged by what they are in purity, in nobility, in love for
          Christ.</p>
