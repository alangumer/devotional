    <h1>Chap. 170—Sunday Missionary Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Preach the word, be urgent in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, and exhort, be unfailing in
          patience and in teaching. 2 Timothy 4:2, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>To defy the Sunday laws will but strengthen in their persecution the religious zealots who are seeking to
          enforce them. Give them no occasion to call you lawbreakers. If they are left to rein up men who fear neither
          God nor man, the reining up will soon lose its novelty for them, and they will see that it is not consistent
          nor convenient for them to be strict in regard to the observance of Sunday. Keep right on with your missionary
          work, with your Bibles in your hands, and the enemy will see that he has worsted his own cause. One does not
          receive the mark of the beast because he shows that he realizes the wisdom of keeping the peace by refraining
          from work that gives offense, doing at the same time a work of the highest importance.</p>
      <p>When we devote Sunday to missionary work, the whip will be taken out of the hands of the arbitrary zealots who
          would be well pleased to humiliate <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists....</p>
      <p>Sunday can be used for carrying forward various lines of work that will accomplish much for the Lord. On this
          day open- air meetings and cottage meetings can be held. <nobr>House-to-house</nobr> work can be done. Those
          who write can devote this day to writing their articles. Whenever it is possible, let religious services be
          held on Sunday. Make these meetings intensely interesting. Sing genuine revival hymns, and speak with power
          and assurance of the Saviour’s love. Speak on temperance and on true religious experience. You will thus learn
          much about how to work, and will reach many souls....</p>
      <p>The law for the observance of the ﬁrst day of the week is the production of an apostate Christendom. Sunday is
          a child of the Papacy, exalted by the Christian world above the sacred day of God’s rest. In no case are God’s
          people to pay it homage. But I wish them to understand that they are not doing God’s will by braving
          opposition when He wishes them to avoid it.</p>
      <p>Wonderful scenes are opening before us; and at this time a living testimony is to be borne in the lives of
          God’s professed people, so that the world may see that in this age, when evil reigns on every side, there is
          yet a people who are laying aside their will and are seeking to do God’s <nobr>will—a</nobr> people in whose
          hearts and lives God’s law is written.</p>
