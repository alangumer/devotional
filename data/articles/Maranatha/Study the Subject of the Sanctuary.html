    <h1>Chap. 239—Study the Subject of the Sanctuary</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
          Daniel 8:14.</strong></p>
      <p>We should be earnest students of prophecy; we should not rest until we become intelligent in regard to the
          subject of the sanctuary, which is brought out in the visions of Daniel and John. This subject sheds great
          light on our present position and work, and gives us unmistakable proof that God has led us in our past
          experience. It explains our disappointment in 1844, showing us that the sanctuary to be cleansed was not the
          earth, as we had supposed, but that Christ then entered into the most holy apartment of the heavenly
          sanctuary, and is there performing the closing work of His priestly ofﬁce, in fulﬁllment of the words of the
          angel to the prophet Daniel.</p>
      <p>The 2300 days had been found to begin when the commandment of Artaxerxes for the restoration and building of
          Jerusalem, went into effect, in the autumn of 457 B.C. Taking this as the starting point, there was perfect
          harmony in the application of all the events foretold in the explanation of that period in Daniel
          <nobr>9:25-27....</nobr> The</p>
      <p>seventy weeks, or 490 years, were to pertain especially to the Jews. At the expiration of this period, the
          nation sealed its rejection of Christ by the persecution of His disciples, and the apostles turned to the
          Gentiles, A.D. 34. The ﬁrst 490 years of the 2300 having then ended, 1810 years would remain. From A.D. 34,
          1810 years extend to 1844. “Then,” said the angel, “shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”</p>
      <p>Our faith in reference to the messages of the ﬁrst, second, and third angels was correct. The great waymarks we
          have passed are immovable. Although the hosts of hell may try to tear them from their foundation, and triumph
          in the thought that they have succeeded, yet they do not succeed. These pillars of truth stand ﬁrm as the
          eternal hills, unmoved by all the efforts of men combined with those of Satan and his host. We can learn much,
          and should be constantly searching the Scriptures to see if these things are so.</p>
