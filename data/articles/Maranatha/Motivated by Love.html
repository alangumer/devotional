    <h1>Chap. 93—Motivated by Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And this commandment we have from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. 1 John
          4:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Love is the basis of godliness. Whatever the profession, no man has pure love to God unless he has unselﬁsh
          love for his brother.... When self is merged</p>
      <p>in Christ, love springs forth spontaneously. The completeness of Christian character is attained when the
          impulse to help and bless others springs constantly from <nobr>within—when</nobr> the sunshine of heaven ﬁlls
          the heart and is revealed in the countenance....</p>
      <p>Connected with Christ, we are connected with our fellow men by the golden links of the chain of love. Then the
          pity and compassion of Christ will be manifest in our life. We shall not wait to have the needy and
          unfortunate brought to us. We shall not need to be entreated to feel for the woes of others. It will be as
          natural for us to minister to the needy and suffering as it was for Christ to go about doing good....</p>
      <p>The glory of heaven is in lifting up the fallen, comforting the distressed.... No</p>
      <p>distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste is recognized by God.... All men</p>
      <p>are of one family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came to demolish every wall of
          partition, to throw open every compartment of the temple, that every soul may have free access to God. His
          love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it penetrates everywhere. It lifts out of Satan’s circle the poor
          souls who have been deluded by his deceptions. It places them within reach of the throne of God, the throne
          encircled by the rainbow of promise....</p>
      <p>Christ is seeking to uplift all who will be lifted to companionship with Himself, that we may be one with Him
          as He is one with the Father. He permits us to come in contact with suffering and calamity in order to call us
          out of our selﬁshness; He seeks to develop in us the attributes of His <nobr>character—compassion,</nobr>
          tenderness, and love....</p>
      <p>“If thou wilt keep my charge,” the Lord declares, “I will give thee places to walk among these that stand
          <nobr>by”—even</nobr> among the angels that surround His throne. (Zechariah 3:7.) By cooperating with heavenly
          beings in their work on earth, we are preparing for their companionship in heaven.</p>
