    <h1>Chap. 136—The Criers of Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will ﬁll ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall
          be as this day, and much more abundant. Isaiah 56:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The evil servant says in his heart, “My lord delayeth his coming.” He does not say that Christ will not come.
          He does not scoff at the idea of His second coming. But in his heart and by his actions and words he declares
          that the Lord’s coming is delayed. He banishes from the minds of others the conviction that the Lord is coming
          quickly. His inﬂuence leads men to presumptuous, careless delay. They are conﬁrmed in their worldliness and
          stupor. Earthly passions, corrupt thoughts, take possession of the mind. The evil servant eats and drinks with
          the drunken, unites with the world in pleasure seeking. He smites his fellow servants, accusing and condemning
          those who are faithful to their Master....</p>
      <p>The advent of Christ will surprise the false teachers. They are saying, “Peace and safety.” Like the priests
          and teachers before the fall of Jerusalem, they look for the church to enjoy earthly prosperity and glory. The
          signs of the times they interpret as foreshadowing this. But what saith the Word of Inspiration? “Sudden
          destruction cometh upon them.” ...</p>
      <p>Men are putting afar off the coming of the Lord. They laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, “All things
          continue as they were from the beginning.” “Tomorrow shall be as this day and much more abundant.” 2 Peter
          3:4; Isaiah 56:12. We will go deeper into pleasure loving. But Christ says, “Behold, I come as a thief.”
          Revelation 16:15. At the very time when the world is asking in scorn, “Where is the promise of his coming?”
          the signs are fulﬁlling. While they cry, “Peace and safety,” sudden destruction is coming. When the scorner,
          the rejecter of truth, has become presumptuous; when the routine of work in the various
          <nobr>money-making</nobr> lines is carried on without regard to principle; when the student is eagerly seeking
          knowledge of everything but his Bible, Christ comes as a thief.</p>
