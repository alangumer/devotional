    <h1>Chap. 62—A New Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of
          God.... You must be born anew. John <nobr>3:5-7,</nobr> R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law is attempting an impossibility. There is
          no safety for one who has merely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Christian’s life is not a
          modiﬁcation or improvement of the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a
          new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy
          Spirit....</p>
      <p>A person may not be able to tell the exact time or place, or to trace all the circumstances in the process of
          conversion; but this does not prove him to be unconverted. By an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ is
          constantly working upon the heart. Little by little, perhaps unconsciously to the receiver, impressions are
          made that tend to draw the soul to Christ.... Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with</p>
      <p>more direct appeal, the soul gladly surrenders itself to Jesus. By many this is called sudden conversion; but
          it is the result of long wooing by the Spirit of <nobr>God,—a</nobr> patient, protracted process.</p>
      <p>While the wind is itself invisible, it produces effects that are seen and felt. So the work of the Spirit upon
          the soul will reveal itself in every act of him who has felt its saving power. When the Spirit of God takes
          possession of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love,
          humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness, and the
          countenance reﬂects the light of heaven. No one sees the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the light
          descend from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself to God. Then that
          power which no human eye can see creates a new being in the image of God.</p>
      <p>It is impossible for ﬁnite minds to comprehend the work of redemption. Its mystery exceeds human knowledge; yet
          he who passes from death to life realizes that it is a divine reality. The beginning of redemption we may know
          here through a personal experience. Its results reach through the eternal ages.</p>
