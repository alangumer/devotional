    <h1>Chap. 253—God’s Work is Finished</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and
          then shall the end come. Matthew 24:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The solemn, sacred message of warning must be proclaimed in the most difﬁcult ﬁelds and in the most sinful
          cities, in every place where the light of the great threefold gospel message has not yet dawned. Every one is
          to hear the last call to the marriage supper of the Lamb. From town to town, from city to city, from country
          to country, the message of present truth is to be proclaimed, not with outward display, but in the power of
          the Spirit.</p>
      <p>The message of the renewing power of God’s grace will be carried to every country and clime, until the truth
          shall belt the world. Of the number of them that shall be sealed will be those who have come from every nation
          and kindred and tongue and people. From every country will be gathered men and women who will stand before the
          throne of God and before the Lamb, crying, “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
          Lamb.” Revelation 7:10.</p>
      <p>The whole earth is to be illuminated with the glory of God’s truth. The light is to shine to all lands and all
          peoples. And it is from those who have received the light that it is to shine forth. The daystar has risen
          upon us, and we are to ﬂash its light upon the pathway of those in darkness.</p>
      <p>A crisis is right upon us. We must now by the Holy Spirit’s power proclaim the great truths for these last
          days. It will not be long before everyone will have heard the warning and made his decision. Then shall the
          end come.</p>
      <p>The truth contained in the ﬁrst, second, and third angel’s messages must go to every nation, kindred, tongue,
          and people; it must lighten the darkness of every continent, and extend to the islands of the sea. There must
          be no delay in this work.</p>
      <p>Our watchword is to be, Onward, ever onward! Angels of heaven will go before us to prepare the way. Our burden
          for the regions beyond can never be laid down till the whole earth is lightened with the glory of the
          Lord.</p>
