    <h1>Chap. 308—Unspeakable Gladness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus ... for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at
          the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>“These things have I spoken unto you,” said Christ, “that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might
          be full.” John 15:11.</p>
      <p>Ever before Him, Christ saw the result of His mission. His earthly life, so full of toil and
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> was cheered by the thought that He would not have all this travail for nought. By
          giving His life for the life of men, He would restore in humanity the image of God. He would lift us up from
          the dust, reshape the character after the pattern of His own character, and make it beautiful with His own
          glory.</p>
      <p>Christ saw of the travail of His soul and was satisﬁed. He viewed the expanse of eternity and saw the happiness
          of those who through His humiliation should receive pardon and everlasting life. He was wounded for their
          transgressions, bruised for their iniquities. The chastisement of their peace was upon Him, and with His
          stripes they were healed. He heard the shout of the redeemed. He heard the ransomed ones singing the song of
          Moses and the Lamb. Although the baptism of blood must ﬁrst be received, although the sins of the world were
          to weigh upon His innocent soul, although the shadow of an unspeakable woe was upon Him; yet for the joy that
          was set before Him He chose to endure the cross and despised the shame.</p>
      <p>This joy all His followers are to share. However great and glorious hereafter, our reward is not all to be
          reserved for the time of ﬁnal deliverance. Even here we are by faith to enter into the Saviour’s joy.</p>
      <p>To those who receive Him, He gives power to become the sons of God, that at last God may receive them as His,
          to dwell with Him throughout eternity. If, during this life, they are loyal to God, they will at last “see His
          face; and His name shall be in their foreheads.” Revelation 22:4. And what is the happiness of heaven but to
          see God? What greater joy could come to the sinner saved by the grace of Christ than to look upon the face of
          God and know Him as Father?</p>
