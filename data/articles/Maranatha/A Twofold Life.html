    <h1>Chap. 117—A Twofold Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 1 John 1:3. Nothing is more needed in
          our work than the practical results of communion</strong></p>
      <p>with God. We should show by our daily lives that we have peace and rest in the Saviour. His peace in the heart
          will shine forth in the countenance.... Communion</p>
      <p>with God will ennoble the character and the life. Men will take knowledge of us, as of the ﬁrst disciples, that
          we have been with Jesus. This will impart to the worker a power that nothing else can give. Of this power he
          must not allow himself to be deprived. We must live a twofold <nobr>life—a</nobr> life of thought and action,
          of silent prayer and earnest work.</p>
      <p>All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for communion with their own hearts, with nature, and
          with God.... We must individually hear Him</p>
      <p>speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of
          the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, “Be still, and know that I am God.” Psalm 46:10.
          This is the effectual preparation for all labor for God. Amidst the hurrying throng, and the strain of life’s
          intense activities, he who is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will
          receive a new endowment of both physical and mental strength. His life will breathe out a fragrance, and will
          reveal a divine power that will reach men’s hearts.</p>
      <p>Many, even in their seasons of devotion, fail of receiving the blessing of real communion with God. They are in
          too great haste. With hurried steps they press through the circle of Christ’s loving presence, pausing perhaps
          a moment within the sacred precincts, but not waiting for counsel. They have no time to remain with the divine
          Teacher. With their burdens they return to their work.</p>
      <p>These workers can never attain the highest success until they learn the secret of strength. They must give
          themselves time to think, to pray, to wait upon God for a renewal of physical, mental, and spiritual power.
          They need the uplifting inﬂuence of His Spirit. Receiving this, they will be quickened by fresh life.</p>
