    <h1>Chap. 108—Preaching with Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, “Repent, for the kingdom of
          heaven is at hand.” Matthew 3:1, 2, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>John the Baptist in his desert life was taught of God. He studied the revelations of God in nature. Under the
          guiding of the Divine Spirit, he studied the scrolls of the prophets. By day and by night, Christ was his
          study, his meditation, until mind and heart and soul were ﬁlled with the glorious vision.</p>
      <p>He looked upon the King in His beauty, and self was lost sight of. He beheld the majesty of holiness and knew
          himself to be inefﬁcient and unworthy. It was God’s message that he was to declare. It was in God’s power and
          His righteousness that he was to stand. He was ready to go forth as Heaven’s messenger, unawed by the human,
          because he had looked upon the Divine. He could stand fearless in the presence of earthly monarchs because
          with trembling he had bowed before the King of kings.</p>
      <p>With no elaborate arguments or ﬁnespun theories did John declare his message. Startling and stern, yet full of
          hope, his voice was heard from the wilderness: “Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Matthew 3:2.
          With a new, strange power it moved the people. The whole nation was stirred. Multitudes ﬂocked to the
          wilderness....</p>
      <p>In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John is
          to be done. God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord.... As a people
          who believe in Christ’s</p>
      <p>soon appearing, we have a message to <nobr>bear—“Prepare</nobr> to meet thy God.” Amos 4:12. Our message must
          be as direct as was the message of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. Notwithstanding that his life
          was imperiled, he did not hesitate to declare God’s word. And our work in this age must be done as
          faithfully.</p>
      <p>In order to give such a message as John gave, we must have a spiritual experience like his. The same work must
          be wrought in us. We must behold God, and in beholding Him lose sight of self.</p>
