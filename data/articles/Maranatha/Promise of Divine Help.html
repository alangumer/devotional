    <h1>Chap. 247—Promise of Divine Help</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in
          that same hour what ye shall speak. Matthew 10:19.</strong></p>
      <p>The servants of Christ are to prepare no set speech to present when brought to trial for their faith. Their
          preparation is to be made day by day, in treasuring up in their hearts the precious truths of God’s Word, in
          feeding upon the teaching of Christ, and through prayer strengthening their faith; then, when brought into
          trial, the Holy Spirit will bring to their remembrance the very truths that will reach the hearts of those who
          shall come to hear. God will ﬂash the knowledge obtained by diligent searching of the Scriptures, into their
          memory at the very time when it is needed.</p>
      <p>You are now to get ready for the time of trial. Now you are to know whether your feet are planted on the
          Eternal Rock. You must have an individual experience, and not depend upon others for your light. When you are
          brought to the test, how do you know that you will not be alone, with no earthly friend at your side? Will you
          then be able to realize that Christ is your support? Will you be able to recall the promise, “Lo, I am with
          you alway, even unto the end of the world”? There will be invisible ones all about you bent upon your
          destruction. Satan and his agents will seek in every way to make you waver from your steadfastness to God and
          His truth. But if you have an eye single to His glory, you need not take thought as to how you shall witness
          for His truth.</p>
      <p>Young men and women, are you growing up to the full stature of men and women in Christ, so that when the crisis
          comes, you cannot be separated from the Source of your strength? If we would stand during the time of test, we
          must now, in the time of peace, be gaining a living experience in the things of God. We must now learn to
          understand what are the deep movings of the Spirit of God. Christ must be our all and in all, the Alpha and
          Omega, the ﬁrst and the last, the beginning and the end.</p>
