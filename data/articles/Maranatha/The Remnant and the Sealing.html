    <h1>Chap. 205—The Remnant and the Sealing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem
          rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the ﬁre? Zechariah 3:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The remnant church will be brought into great trial and distress. Those who keep the commandments of God and
          the faith of Jesus, will feel the ire of the dragon and his hosts. Satan numbers the world as his subjects; he
          has gained control of the apostate churches. But here is a little company that are resisting his supremacy. If
          he could blot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete. As he inﬂuenced the heathen nations to
          destroy Israel, so in the near future he will stir up the wicked powers of earth to destroy the people of God.
          All will be required to render obedience to human edicts in violation of the divine law. Those who will be
          true to God and to duty will be menaced, denounced, and proscribed. They will be betrayed “both by parents,
          and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends.”</p>
      <p>Their only hope is in the mercy of God; their only defense will be prayer. As Joshua was pleading before the
          Angel, so the remnant church, with brokenness of heart and earnest faith, will plead for pardon and
          deliverance through Jesus their Advocate....</p>
      <p>Satan urges before God his accusations against them, declaring that they have by their sins forfeited the
          divine protection, and claiming the right to destroy them as transgressors....</p>
      <p>But while the followers of Christ have sinned, they have not given themselves to the control of evil. They have
          put away their sins, and have sought the Lord in humility and contrition, and the divine Advocate pleads in
          their behalf....</p>
      <p>The people of God are sighing and crying for the abominations done in the land. With tears they warn the wicked
          of their danger in trampling upon the divine law, and with unutterable sorrow they humble themselves before
          the Lord on account of their own transgressions. The wicked mock their sorrow, ridicule their solemn appeals,
          and sneer at what they term their weakness. But the anguish and humiliation of God’s people is unmistakable
          evidence that they are regaining the strength and nobility of character lost in consequence of sin....</p>
      <p>While Satan was urging his accusations, holy angels, unseen, were passing to and fro, placing upon them the
          seal of the living God.</p>
