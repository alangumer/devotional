    <h1>Chap. 306—We shall Meet Our Guardian Angels</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. Psalm 91:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Not until the providences of God are seen in the light of eternity shall we understand what we owe to the care
          and interposition of His angels. Celestial beings have taken an active part in the affairs of men. They have
          appeared in garments that shone as the lightning; they have come as men, in the garb of wayfarers. They have
          accepted the hospitalities of human homes; they acted as guides to benighted travelers. They have thwarted the
          spoiler’s purpose and turned aside the stroke of the destroyer.</p>
      <p>Though the rulers of this world know it not, yet often in their councils angels have been spokesmen. Human eyes
          have looked upon them. Human ears have listened to their appeals. In the council hall and the court of
          justice, heavenly messengers have pleaded the cause of the persecuted and oppressed. They have defeated
          purposes and arrested evils that would have brought wrong and suffering to God’s children. To the students in
          the heavenly school, all this will be unfolded.</p>
      <p>Every redeemed one will understand the ministry of angels in his own life. The angel who was his guardian from
          his earliest moment; the angel who watched his steps, and covered his head in the day of peril; the angel who
          was with him in the valley of the shadow of death, who marked his resting place, who was the ﬁrst to greet him
          in the resurrection <nobr>morning—what</nobr> will it be to hold converse with him, and to learn the history
          of divine interposition in the individual life, of heavenly <nobr>co-operation</nobr> in every work for
          humanity!</p>
      <p>With the word of God in his hands, every human being, wherever his lot in life may be cast, may have such
          companionship as he shall choose. In its pages he may hold converse with the noblest and best of the human
          race, and may listen to the voice of the Eternal as He speaks with men. As he studies and meditates upon the
          themes into which “the angels desire to look” (1 Peter 1:12), he may have their companionship.</p>
