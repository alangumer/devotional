    <h1>Chap. 12—Last Warnings of the Third Angel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was
          lightened with his glory. Revelation 18:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The angel who unites in the proclamation of the third angel’s message is to lighten the whole earth with his
          glory. A work of <nobr>world-wide</nobr> extent and unwonted power is here foretold. The advent movement of
          <nobr>1840-44</nobr> was a glorious manifestation of the power of God; the ﬁrst angel’s message was carried to
          every missionary station in the world, and in some countries there was the greatest religious interest which
          has been witnessed in any land since the Reformation of the sixteenth century; but these are to be exceeded by
          the mighty movement under the last warning of the third angel....</p>
      <p>The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its
          opening. The prophecies which were fulﬁlled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel
          are again to be fulﬁlled in the latter rain at its close....</p>
      <p>Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten from place to
          place to proclaim the message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be
          given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers.
          Satan also works with lying wonders, even bringing down ﬁre from heaven in the sight of men. Revelation 13:13.
          Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their stand....</p>
      <p>The publications distributed by missionary workers have exerted their inﬂuence, yet many whose minds were
          impressed have been prevented from fully comprehending the truth or from yielding obedience. Now the rays of
          light penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever the bands
          which have held them. Family connections, church relations, are powerless to stay them now. Truth is more
          precious than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a large number take their
          stand upon the Lord’s side.</p>
