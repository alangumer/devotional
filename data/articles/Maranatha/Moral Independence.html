    <h1>Chap. 39—Moral Independence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
          thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the
          Lord Almighty. 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>Many today have veils upon their faces. These veils are sympathy with the customs and practices of the world,
          which hide from them the glory of the Lord. God desires us to keep our eyes ﬁxed upon Him, that we may lose
          sight of the things of this world.</p>
      <p>As the truth is brought into practical life, the standard is to be elevated higher and higher to meet the
          requirements of the Bible. This will necessitate opposition to the fashions, customs, practices, and maxims of
          the world. Worldly inﬂuences, like the waves of the sea, beat against the followers of Christ to sweep them
          away from the true principles of His meekness and grace; but we are to stand as ﬁrm as a rock to principle. It
          will require moral courage to do this, and those whose souls are not riveted to the eternal Rock will be swept
          away by the worldly current. We can stand ﬁrm only as our life is hid with Christ in God. Moral independence
          is wholly in place when opposing the world. By conforming entirely to the will of God, we shall be placed upon
          vantage ground, and shall see the necessity of decided separation from the customs and practices of the world.
          We are not to elevate our standard just a little above the world’s standard, but we are to make the
          distinction decidedly apparent....</p>
      <p>It is no easy matter to gain the priceless treasure of eternal life. No one can do this and drift with the
          current of the world. He must come out from the world and be separate and touch not the unclean. No one can
          act like a worldling without being carried down by the current of the world. No one will make any upward
          progress without persevering effort. He who would overcome must hold fast to Christ. He must not look back,
          but keep the eye ever upward, gaining one grace after another. Individual vigilance is the price of
          safety....</p>
      <p>The end of all things is at hand. There is need now of men armed and equipped to battle for God.</p>
