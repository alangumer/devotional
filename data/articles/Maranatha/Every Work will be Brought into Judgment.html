    <h1>Chap. 332—Every Work will be Brought into Judgment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
          evil. Ecclesiastes 12:14.</strong></p>
      <p>In the case of each individual there is a process going forward which is far more wonderful than that which
          transfers the features to the polished plate of the artist. The art of the photographer merely imprints the
          likeness on perishable substance; but in the <nobr>life-record</nobr> the character is faithfully delineated,
          and this record, however dark, can never be effaced except by the blood of the atoning Sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>Angels of God are taking a daguerreotype of the character just as accurately as the artist takes the likeness
          of the human features; and ... it is from this that we are to be judged!</p>
      <p>When the Judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened, there will be many astonishing disclosures. Men
          will not then appear as they appear to the human eyes and ﬁnite judgments. Secret sins will then be laid open
          to the view of all. Motives and intentions which have been hidden in the dark chambers of the heart will be
          revealed.</p>
      <p>All will appear as a real <nobr>life-picture.</nobr></p>
      <p>In that solemn and awful hour the unfaithfulness of the husband will be opened to the wife, and the
          unfaithfulness of the wife, to the husband. Parents will then learn, for the ﬁrst time, what was the real
          character of their children, and children will see the errors and mistakes that marked the lives of their
          parents. The man who robbed his neighbor through false representations, is not to escape with his
          <nobr>ill-gotten</nobr> gains. God has an exact record in His books, of every unjust account and every unfair
          dealing.</p>
      <p>Memory will be true and vivid in condemnation of the guilty one, who in that day is found wanting. The mind
          will recall all the thoughts and acts of the past; the whole life will come in review like the scenes in a
          panorama.</p>
