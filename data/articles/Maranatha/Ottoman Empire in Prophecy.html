    <h1>Chap. 144—Ottoman Empire in Prophecy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were loosed,
          which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
          Revelation 9:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>The history of nations that one after another have occupied their allotted time and place, unconsciously
          witnessing to the truth of which they themselves knew not the meaning, speaks to us. To every nation and to
          every individual of today God has assigned a place in His great plan. Today men and nations are being measured
          by the plummet in the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All are by their own choice deciding their destiny,
          and God is overruling all for the accomplishment of His purposes....</p>
      <p>All that prophecy has foretold as coming to pass, until the present time, has been traced on the pages of
          history, and we may be assured that all which is yet to come will be fulﬁlled in its order.</p>
      <p>In the year 1840, another remarkable fulﬁlment of prophecy excited widespread interest. Two years before,
          Josiah Litch, one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent, published an exposition of Revelation
          9, predicting the fall of the Ottoman empire. According to his calculations, this power was to be overthrown
          “in A.D. 1840, sometime in the month of August;” and only a few days previous to its accomplishment he wrote:
          “Allowing the ﬁrst period, 150 years, to have been exactly fulﬁlled before Deacozes ascended the throne by
          permission of the Turks, and that the 391 years, ﬁfteen days, commenced at the close of the ﬁrst period, it
          will end on the 11th of August, 1840, when the Ottoman power in Constantinople may be expected to be broken.
          And this, I believe, will be found to be the <nobr>case.”—Josiah</nobr> Litch, in Signs of the Times, and
          Expositor of Prophecy, Aug. 1, 1840.</p>
      <p>At the very time speciﬁed, Turkey, through her ambassadors, accepted the protection of the allied powers of
          Europe, and thus placed herself under the control of Christian nations. The event exactly fulﬁlled the
          prediction.... A wonderful</p>
      <p>impetus was given to the advent movement.</p>
