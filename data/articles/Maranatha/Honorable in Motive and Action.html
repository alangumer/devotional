    <h1>Chap. 220—Honorable in Motive and Action</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath
          forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.</strong></p>
      <p>Principle, right, honesty, should ever be cherished. Honesty will not tarry where policy is harbored. They will
          never agree; one is of Baal, the other of God. The Master requires His servants to be honorable in motive and
          action.... Those who</p>
      <p>choose honesty as their companion will embody it in all their acts. To a large class, these men are not
          pleasing, but to God they are beautiful.</p>
      <p>Satan is working to crowd himself in everywhere. He would put asunder very friends. There are men who are ever
          talking and gossiping and bearing false witness, who sow the seeds of discord and engender strife. Heaven
          looks upon this class as Satan’s most efﬁcient servants. But the man who is injured is in a far less dangerous
          position than when fawned upon and extolled for a few of his efforts which appear successful. The commendation
          of apparent friends is more dangerous than reproach.</p>
      <p>Every man who praises himself brushes the luster from his best efforts. A truly noble character will not stoop
          to resent the false accusations of enemies; every word spoken falls harmless, for it strengthens that which it
          cannot overthrow. The Lord would have His people closely united with Himself, the God of patience and love.
          All should manifest in their lives the love of Christ. Let none venture to belittle the reputation or the
          position of another; this is egotism....</p>
      <p>Never speak disparagingly of any man, for he may be great in the sight of the Lord, while those who feel great
          may be lightly esteemed of God because of the perversity of their hearts. Our only safety is to lie low at the
          foot of the cross, be little in our own eyes, and trust in God; for He alone has power to make us
          great....</p>
      <p>The judgment and ability of all are needed now. Every man’s work is of sufﬁcient importance to demand that it
          be performed with care and ﬁdelity. One man cannot do the work of all. Each has his respective place and his
          special work, and each should realize that the manner in which his work is done must stand the test of the
          judgment.</p>
