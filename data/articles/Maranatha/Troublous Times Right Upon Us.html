    <h1>Chap. 167—Troublous Times Right Upon Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>After these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds
          of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. Revelation
          7:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Four mighty angels are still holding the four winds of the earth. Terrible destruction is forbidden to come in
          full. The ... winds will be the stirring up of the nations to one deadly combat, while the angels hold the
          four winds, forbidding the terrible power of Satan to be exercised in its fury until the servants of God are
          sealed in their foreheads.</p>
      <p>The signs of the times give evidence that the judgments of heaven are being poured out, that the day of the
          Lord is at hand. The daily papers are full of indications of an intense conﬂict in the future. Bold robberies
          are of frequent occurrence. Strikes are common. Thefts and murders are committed on every hand. Men possessed
          by demons are taking the lives of men, women, and little children. All these things testify that the Lord’s
          coming is near.</p>
      <p>The restraining Spirit of God is even now being withdrawn from the world. Hurricanes, storms, tempests,
          disasters by sea and by land, follow one another in quick succession. The signs thickening around us, telling
          of the near approach of the Son of God, are attributed to any other than the true cause....</p>
      <p>The time is right upon us when there will be sorrow in the world that no human balm can heal. Even before the
          last great destruction comes upon the world, the ﬂattering monuments of man’s greatness will be crumbled in
          the dust. God’s retributive judgments will fall on those who in the face of great light have continued in sin.
          Costly buildings, supposed to be ﬁreproof, are erected. But as Sodom perished in the ﬂames of God’s vengeance,
          so will these proud structures become ashes. I have seen vessels which cost immense sums of money wrestling
          with the mighty ocean, seeking to breast the angry billows. But with all their treasures of gold and silver,
          and with all their human freight, they sank into a watery grave....</p>
      <p>But amid the tumult of excitement, with confusion in every place, there is a work to be done for God in the
          world.</p>
