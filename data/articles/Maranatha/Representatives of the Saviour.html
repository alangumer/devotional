    <h1>Chap. 104—Representatives of the Saviour</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in case they speak against you as wrongdoers, they
          may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. 1 Peter 2:12, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>God expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent Him.... They are</p>
      <p>to be a sanctiﬁed, puriﬁed, holy people, communicating light to all with whom they come in contact....</p>
      <p>The followers of Christ are to be separate from the world in principles and interests, but they are not to
          isolate themselves from the world. The Saviour mingled constantly with men, not to encourage them in anything
          that was not in accordance with God’s will, but to uplift and ennoble them. “I sanctify myself,” He declared,
          “that they also might be sanctiﬁed.” John 17:19. So the Christian is to abide among men, that the savor of
          divine love may be as salt to preserve the world from corruption....</p>
      <p>The power of a higher, purer, nobler life is our great need. The world is watching to see what fruit is borne
          by professed Christians.... Impressions favorable or</p>
      <p>unfavorable to Bible religion are constantly being made on the minds of all with whom we have to do.</p>
      <p>And God and the angels are watching. God desires His people to show by their lives the advantage of
          Christianity over worldliness, to show that they are working on a high, holy plane. He longs to see them
          showing that the truth they have received has made them children of the heavenly King. He longs to make them
          channels through which He can pour His boundless love and mercy.</p>
      <p>Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church. When the character of the
          Saviour shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim His own. It is the privilege
          of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten, the coming of our Lord. Were all who profess His name
          bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed of the gospel! Quickly the
          last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ would come.</p>
