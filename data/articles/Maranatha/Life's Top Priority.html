    <h1>Chap. 63—Life’s Top Priority</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Seek ye ﬁrst the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
          Matthew 6:33.</strong></p>
      <p>This is the ﬁrst great <nobr>object—the</nobr> kingdom of heaven, the righteousness of Christ. Other objects to
          be attained should be secondary to these.</p>
      <p>Satan will present the path of holiness as difﬁcult while the paths of worldly pleasure are strewed with
          ﬂowers. In false and ﬂattering colors will the tempter array the world with its pleasures before you. Vanity
          is one of the strongest traits of our depraved natures, and he knows that he can appeal to it successfully. He
          will ﬂatter you through his agents. You may receive praise which will gratify your vanity and foster in you
          pride and <nobr>self-esteem,</nobr> and you may think that with such advantages and attractions it really is a
          great pity for you to come out from the world and be separate, and become a Christian.... But consider that
          the pleasures of earth will</p>
      <p>have an end, and that which you sow you must also reap. Are personal attractions, ability, or talents too
          valuable to devote to God, the Author of your being, He who watches over you every moment? Are your
          qualiﬁcations too precious to devote to God?</p>
      <p>The young urge that they need something to enliven and divert the mind. I saw that there is pleasure in
          industry, a satisfaction in pursuing a life of usefulness. Some still urge that they must have something ...
          to which the mind can turn for relief and refreshment amid cares and wearing labor. The Christian’s hope is
          just what is needed. Religion will prove to the believer a comforter, a sure guide to the Fountain of true
          happiness. The young should study the word of God and give themselves to meditation and prayer, and they will
          ﬁnd that their spare moments cannot be better employed.</p>
      <p>Young friends, you should take time to prove your own selves, whether you are in the love of God. Be diligent
          to make your calling and election sure.</p>
      <p>Seek ﬁrst the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Make this ﬁrst and last. Seek most earnestly to know Him
          whom to know aright is life eternal. Christ and His righteousness is the salvation of the soul.</p>
