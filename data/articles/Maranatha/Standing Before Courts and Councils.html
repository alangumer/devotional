    <h1>Chap. 244—Standing Before Courts and Councils</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. Psalm 119:46.</strong></p>
      <p>In the great closing work we shall meet with perplexities that we know not how to deal with, but let us not
          forget that the three great powers of heaven are working, that a divine hand is on the wheel, and that God
          will bring His purposes to pass.</p>
      <p>The time will come when we shall be brought before councils and before thousands for His name’s sake, and each
          one will have to give the reason of his faith.</p>
      <p>Every position of truth taken by our people will bear the criticism of the greatest minds; the highest of the
          world’s great men will be brought in contact with truth, and therefore every position we take should be
          critically examined and tested by the Scriptures. Now we seem to be unnoticed, but this will not always be.
          Movements are at work to bring us to the front, and if our theories of truth can be picked to pieces by
          historians or the world’s greatest men, it will be done.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus will give the disciples a tongue and wisdom that their adversaries can neither gainsay nor
          resist. Those who could not by reasoning overcome satanic delusions, will bear an afﬁrmative testimony that
          will bafﬂe supposedly learned men. Words will come from the lips of the unlearned with such convincing power
          and wisdom that conversions will be made to the truth. Thousands will be converted under their testimony.</p>
      <p>Why should the illiterate man have this power, which the learned man has not? The illiterate one, through faith
          in Christ, has come into the atmosphere of pure, clear truth, while the learned man has turned away from the
          truth. The poor man is Christ’s witness. He cannot appeal to histories or to <nobr>so-called</nobr> high
          science, but he gathers from the Word of God powerful evidence. The truth that he speaks under the inspiration
          of the Spirit, is so pure and remarkable and carries with it a power so indisputable, that his testimony
          cannot be gainsaid.</p>
