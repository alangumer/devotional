    <h1>Chap. 281—The Second Coming of Christ Our</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a ﬁre shall devour before him, and it shall be very
          tempestuous round about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his
          people. Psalm 50:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>Soon our eyes were drawn to the east, for a small black cloud had appeared, about half as large as a man’s
          hand, which we all knew was the sign of the Son of man. We all in solemn silence gazed on the cloud as it drew
          nearer and became lighter, glorious, and still more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom
          appeared like ﬁre; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it were ten thousand angels, singing a most
          lovely song; and upon it sat the Son of man.</p>
      <p>When it ﬁrst appeared in the distance, this cloud looked very small. The angel said that it was the sign of the
          Son of man. As it drew nearer the earth, we could behold the excellent glory and majesty of Jesus as He rode
          forth to conquer.</p>
      <p>His hair was white and curly and lay on His shoulders; and upon his head were many crowns. His feet had the
          appearance of ﬁre; in His right hand was a sharp sickle; in His left, a silver trumpet. His eyes were as a
          ﬂame of ﬁre, which searched His children through and through. Then all faces gathered paleness, and those that
          God had rejected gathered blackness. Then we all cried out, “Who shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless?”
          Then the angels ceased to sing, and there was some time of awful silence, when Jesus spoke: “Those who have
          clean hands and pure hearts shall be able to stand; My grace is sufﬁcient for you.” At this our faces lighted
          up, and joy ﬁlled every heart. And the angels struck a note higher and sang again, while the cloud drew still
          nearer the earth.</p>
      <p>The earth trembled before Him, the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together, and every mountain
          and island were moved out of their places. “And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
          and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens
          and in the rocks of the mountains.”</p>
