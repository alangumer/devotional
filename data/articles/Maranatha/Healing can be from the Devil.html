    <h1>Chap. 140—Healing can be from the Devil</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
          he may devour. 1 Peter 5:8.</strong></p>
      <p>The fallacies of Satan are now being multiplied, and those who swerve from the path of truth will lose their
          bearings. Having nothing to which to anchor, they will drift from one delusion to another, blown about by the
          winds of strange doctrines. Satan has come down with great power. Many will be deceived by his miracles.</p>
      <p>I am instructed to say that in the future great watchfulness will be needed. There is to be among God’s people
          no spiritual stupidity. Evil spirits are actively engaged in seeking to control the minds of human beings. Men
          are binding up in bundles, ready to be consumed by the ﬁres of the last days. Those who discard Christ and His
          righteousness will accept the sophistry that is ﬂooding the world. Christians are to be sober and vigilant,
          steadfastly resisting their adversary the devil, who is going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may
          devour. Men under the inﬂuence of evil spirits will work miracles....</p>
      <p>We need not be deceived. Wonderful scenes, with which Satan will be closely connected, will soon take place.
          God’s Word declares that Satan will work miracles. He will make people sick, and then will suddenly remove
          from them his satanic power. They will then be regarded as healed. These works of apparent healing will bring
          <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists to the test....</p>
      <p>If those through whom cures are performed, are disposed, on account of these manifestations, to excuse their
          neglect of the law of God, and continue in disobedience, though they have power to any and every extent, it
          does not follow that they have the great power of God. On the contrary, it is the <nobr>miracle-working</nobr>
          power of the great deceiver. He is a transgressor of the moral law, and employs every device that he can
          master to blind men to its true character. We are warned that in the last days he will work with signs and
          lying wonders. And he will continue these wonders until the close of probation, that he may point to them as
          evidence that he is an angel of light and not of darkness.</p>
