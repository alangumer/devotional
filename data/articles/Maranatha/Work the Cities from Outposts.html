    <h1>Chap. 176—Work the Cities from Outposts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
          thing; and I will receive you. 2 Corinthians 6:17.</strong></p>
      <p>As God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people, we must leave the cities. As did Enoch, we must work in the
          cities but not dwell in them.</p>
      <p>As far as possible, our institutions should be located away from the cities.... It</p>
      <p>is not God’s will that His people shall settle in the cities, where there is constant turmoil and confusion.
          Their children should be spared this; for the whole system is demoralized by the hurry and rush and noise. The
          Lord desires His people to move into the country, where they can settle on the land, and raise their own fruit
          and vegetables, and where their children can be brought in direct contact with the works of God in nature.
          Take your families away from the cities is my message.</p>
      <p>The truth must be spoken, whether men will hear, or whether men will forbear. The cities are ﬁlled with
          temptation. We should plan our work in such a way as to keep our young people as far as possible from this
          contamination.</p>
      <p>The cities are to be worked from outposts. Said the messenger of God, “Shall not the cities be warned? Yes; not
          by God’s people living in them, but by their visiting them, to warn them of what is coming upon the
          earth.”</p>
      <p>When iniquity abounds in a nation, there is always to be heard some voice giving warning and instruction, as
          the voice of Lot was heard in Sodom. Yet Lot could have preserved his family from many evils had he not made
          his home in this wicked, polluted city. All that Lot and his family did in Sodom could have been done by them,
          even if they had lived in a place some distance away from the city. Enoch walked with God, and yet he did not
          live in the midst of any city polluted with every kind of violence and wickedness, as did Lot in Sodom.</p>
      <p>He [Enoch] did not make his abode with the wicked.... He placed himself and</p>
      <p>his family where the atmosphere would be as pure as possible. Then at times he went forth to the inhabitants of
          the world with his <nobr>God-given</nobr> message.... After</p>
      <p>proclaiming his message, he always took back with him to his place of retirement some who had received the
          warning.</p>
