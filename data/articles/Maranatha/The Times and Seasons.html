    <h1>Chap. 128—The Times and Seasons</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his
          own power. Acts 1:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The times and seasons God has put in His own power. And why has not God given us this
          <nobr>knowledge?—Because</nobr> we would not make a right use of it if He did. A condition of things would
          result from this knowledge among our people that would greatly retard the work of God in preparing a people to
          stand in the great day that is to come.... Jesus has told His disciples to “watch,” but not for deﬁnite time.
          His</p>
      <p>followers are to be in the position of those who are listening for the orders of their Captain; they are to
          watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time for the coming of the Lord; but no one will be able to
          predict just when that time will come; for “of that day and hour knoweth no man.” You will not be able to say
          that He will come in one, two, or ﬁve years, neither are you to put off His coming by stating that it may not
          be for ten or twenty years.... We are not to know the deﬁnite time either</p>
      <p>for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or for the coming of Christ.</p>
      <p>I was pointed to some who are in the great error of believing that it is their duty to go to Old Jerusalem,
          [Written in the early 1850’s when “the <nobr>age-to-come”</nobr> advocates taught that Old Jerusalem would be
          built up as a center of Christian witness fulﬁlling certain prophecies of the O.T.] and think they have a work
          to do there before the Lord comes. Such a view is calculated to take the mind and interest from the present
          work of the Lord, under the message of the third angel; for those who think that they are yet to go to
          Jerusalem will have their minds there, and their means will be withheld from the cause of present truth to get
          themselves and others there. I saw that such a mission would accomplish no real good, that it would take a
          long while to make a very few of the Jews believe even in the ﬁrst advent of Christ, much more to believe in
          His second advent.</p>
