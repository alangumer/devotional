    <h1>Chap. 15—Uplift Jesus as the Center</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. Revelation
          22:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The perils of the last days are upon us, and in our work we are to warn the people of the danger they are in.
          Let not the solemn scenes which prophecy has revealed be left untouched. If our people were half awake, if
          they realized the nearness of the events portrayed in the Revelation, a reformation would be wrought in our
          churches, and many more would believe the message. We have no time to lose.... Advance</p>
      <p>new principles, and crowd in the <nobr>clear-cut</nobr> truth. It will be as a sword cutting both ways. But be
          not too ready to take a controversial attitude. There will be times when we must stand still and see the
          salvation of God. Let Daniel speak, let the Revelation speak, and tell what is truth. But whatever phase of
          the subject is presented, uplift Jesus as the center of all hope, “the root and the offspring of David, and
          the bright and morning star.”</p>
      <p>We do not go deep enough in our search for truth. Every soul who believes present truth will be brought where
          he will be required to give a reason of the hope that is in him. The people of God will be called upon to
          stand before kings, princes, rulers, and great men of the earth, and they must know that they do know what is
          truth. They must be converted men and women. God can teach you more in one moment by His Holy Spirit than you
          could learn from the great men of the earth. The universe is looking upon the controversy that is going on
          upon the earth. At an inﬁnite cost, God has provided for every man an opportunity to know that which will make
          him wise unto salvation. How eagerly do angels look to see who will avail himself of this opportunity! When a
          message is presented to God’s people, they should not rise up in opposition to it; they should go to the
          Bible, comparing it with the law and the testimony, and if it does not bear this test, it is not true. God
          wants our minds to expand. He desires to put His grace upon us. We may have a feast of good things every day,
          for God can open the whole treasure of heaven to us.</p>
