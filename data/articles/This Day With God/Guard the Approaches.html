    <h1>Guard the Approaches</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
          doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. Psalm 126:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>Many times we [James and Ellen White] are disappointed in our expectations, but, then when we see the Lord
          working with our efforts, and souls coming to Christ, we forget the weariness, disappointments, and trials
          which we meet in connection with this work and feel honored of God to be permitted to have a part in it. We
          have had some very precious seasons of prayer with some who were discouraged and almost in despair [in a camp
          meeting held in Iowa]. We rejoiced with them as light shone into the darkened chambers of the soul. The Lord
          has indeed encouraged our hearts and strengthened us for our great work. We do believe fruit will abound to
          the glory of God as the result of this meeting.</p>
      <p>Let your prayers, my children [Edson and Emma], go up to heaven in our behalf, that God would bring souls who
          are in the darkness of error to the knowledge of the truth. Light, precious light is shining on every page of
          the Word of God. It is the man of our counsel. When we study its pages with a heartfelt desire to learn our
          duty, angels are close beside us to impress the mind and strengthen the imagination to discern the sacred
          things revealed in the Word of God.</p>
      <p>Every thought, word, and act, we should bring to the test of God’s revealed will. In all things the inquiry
          should be, Will this please God? Will it be in accordance with the teachings of His Word? And when there is an
          indecision of mind in regard to duty, our natural hearts will plead for indulgence to follow inclination. But
          let us ever take the safe course, however much <nobr>self-denial</nobr> it may involve. Let us be determined
          to run no risks where eternal interests are involved....</p>
      <p>Dear son, Edson, guard faithfully your thoughts. Keep every approach to your heart well fortiﬁed. You must put
          up the bars against the approach of Satan. Watchfulness at one point while others are neglected will not
          avail. The careless neglect of one sentinel will imperil the entire army. The neglect to guard one path to the
          fortress may prove the loss of the city.... There are perils before us</p>
      <p>which we must meet, and our only safety is in <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 32, June 14, 1876„ to Edson and Emma
          White.</p>
