    <h1>Flickering Lights</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is
          in heaven. Matthew 5:16.</strong></p>
      <p>I long to see the church arise to a full sense of their responsibility and accountability before God, to let
          their light shine forth to the world in clear, steady, bright rays. The light of many is too ﬂickering, ﬁtful,
          and uncertain. It will at times blaze forth in bright rays and then it becomes almost extinct. The Lord God of
          Israel cannot be gloriﬁed unless the light shines steadily amid the moral darkness, as well as in the light.
          The light of the Sun of Righteousness is never dim. It is constantly shining upon us. Notwithstanding Satan
          casts his hellish shadow athwart our path, the light shineth beyond.</p>
      <p>Then why should not the followers of Jesus walk in His light, reﬂecting the bright beams of the Sun of
          Righteousness? They may do this. Christ has enjoined upon them to do this, and He makes it possible for them
          to do this, for He would never enjoin them to do that which it is not possible for them to do. What is
          possible should be done, not only for their own happiness and peace, but for the good of the world.</p>
      <p>We need daily to uplift the soul heavenward, catching the bright beams of light from the Sun of Righteousness.
          Hath God forgotten to be gracious to His people who fear Him, who love Him? No. Hath He shut up His tender
          mercies that they can no longer reach His tried and tempted ones? I tell you, nay. Look up, trembling,
          doubting souls. Look up to the face of Jesus Christ, beaming with love upon the purchase of His blood, and
          doubt no more.</p>
      <p>Jesus lives as your Advocate, your great High Priest. He is your representative before the Father in the courts
          of heaven. His mediation secures you everything that your faith claims. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek,
          and ye shall ﬁnd; knock and it shall be opened unto you” (Matthew 7:7). Who has said it? The Everlasting
          Father, the Prince of Peace. He is your Saviour. Never will He fail to prove true to His word. Never will He
          falsify Himself. God hath promised. Let faith claim the <nobr>promise.—Manuscript</nobr> 24, December 21,
          1889„ diary.</p>
