      <p><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath
          begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
          incorruptible, and undeﬁled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. 1 Peter 1:3,
          4.</strong></p>
      <p>The religion of Jesus Christ means something more than talk. The righteousness of Christ consists in right
          actions and good works from pure, unselﬁsh motives. Outside righteousness, while the inward adorning is
          wanting, will be of no avail. “This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that
          God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
          darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
          one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John
          <nobr>1:5-7).</nobr> If we have not the light and love of God, we are not His children. If we gather not with
          Christ, we scatter abroad. We all have an inﬂuence, and that inﬂuence is telling upon the destiny of others,
          for their present and future good, or for their eternal loss.</p>
      <p>All have lessons to learn in the school of Christ, in order to perfect Christian characters, and have a oneness
          with Christ. Said Christ to His disciples, “Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall
          not enter into the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 18:3). He explained His meaning to them. He did not wish them
          to become children in understanding, but in malice. Little children do not manifest feelings of superiority
          and aristocracy. They are simple and natural in their appearance. Christ would have His followers cultivate
          unaffected manners, that their whole bearing might be humble and Christlike. He has made it our duty to live
          for others’ good. He came from the royal courts of heaven to this world, to show how great an interest He had
          in man; and the inﬁnite price paid for the redemption of man shows that man is of so great value that Christ
          could sacriﬁce His riches and honor in the royal courts, to lift him from the degradation of sin.</p>
      <p>If the Majesty of heaven could do so much to evidence His love for man, what ought not men to be willing to do
          for each other, to help one another up out of the pit of darkness and <nobr>suffering?—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, June 22, 1886.</p>
