    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer. Romans 12:12.</strong></p>
      <p>God demands of us to exercise fervent piety under all and every circumstance in harmony with Jesus Christ. Seek
          for work in His lines because this is the fruit of true godliness. Win souls to Jesus.</p>
      <p>If you feel at liberty to moan and groan over bereavements, things that are past, out of your keeping, things
          you cannot change or alter, you will neglect the present duties lying directly in your pathway. Look unto
          Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith. Turn your attention from subjects which make you gloomy
          and sad, for you become an agent in the hands of the enemy to multiply gloom and darkness and you will make
          the atmosphere surrounding your soul dark and forbidding. Although severe afﬂictions may come upon you, it is
          your business to look up, and to see light in Jesus....</p>
      <p>If you are exclusively engaged in dwelling upon your own sorrows and darkness, thinking God has dealt hard with
          you, your religion is not uplifting but is depressing. You become a shadow of darkness, hard and complaining,
          when exclusively shut up to your own sorrows.</p>
      <p>Sister McCalpin was present and she was doing this.</p>
      <p>She had lost her son, who was not prepared to die. She spoke, with others, in the social meeting. Oh, her heart
          was so heavy and sad, but she said she was comforted with the words spoken by Sister White. We had a good,
          proﬁtable social meeting, then this afﬂicted sister spoke to me about her son they had buried a few weeks
          before, dying without hope, and the sorrow and grief she had felt. I entreated her to leave the mourning for
          the dead, which would do no good to worry over; that she as a mother should wisely and mercifully care for the
          living children, and that she had not a moment to devote to vain regrets, but to gird up the loins of her mind
          and go to work and try to bring her children to Jesus and herself surrender to Christ that she might grow in
          grace and the knowledge of Christ. Working in Christ’s lines, she would never grow cold but become identiﬁed
          with the Saviour in all His <nobr>plans.—Manuscript</nobr> 83, August 12, 1893„ diary.</p>
