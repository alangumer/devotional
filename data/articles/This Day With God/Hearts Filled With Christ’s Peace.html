    <h1>Hearts Filled With Christ’s Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That they all may be one; as thou Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us:
          that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. John 17:21.</strong></p>
      <p>As Christ came to the world to seek and to save perishing souls, that they should have the light of truth, so
          also hath He committed the same work to all who receive Him as their Saviour. “And for their sakes I sanctify
          myself, that they also might be sanctiﬁed through the truth” (John 17:19).</p>
      <p>How important that we should be rooted and grounded in the truth! No falsehood is of the truth. The Lord Jesus
          has promised that, if we receive Him by faith and believe in Him as our pattern, He will give us “power to
          become the sons of God.” The gospel of Jesus Christ contains the grand principles of all truth, expressed in a
          life of purity. In love and true righteousness these principles are to be proclaimed to the world. In all our
          dealings with one another we are to obey the precepts of the law of God. “I sanctify myself, that they also
          might be sanctiﬁed through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on
          me through their word” (Verses 19, 20).</p>
      <p>From these words we see how much is dependent on the character of all those who claim to believe the gospel of
          Jesus Christ. By the lives of Christ’s followers the world will judge the Saviour. If anyone, in word or deed,
          departs from the living principles of the truth, he dishonors his Saviour and puts Christ to open shame.</p>
      <p>Let every soul believe in Christ, and receive the power that Christ has promised, that he may be a child of
          God, holding the truth conscientiously, its principles interwoven with his words, his spirit, and all his
          works. Thus Christians may become a reﬁning, purifying inﬂuence, working against false religion and inﬁdelity.
          Their presence brings with it the grand inﬂuence of heavenly principles, making them, through Christ, an honor
          to the gospel. They increase in power to communicate the sanctifying grace of heaven, gaining continually in
          inﬂuence through their increasing reverence for the truth. Their hearts are ﬁlled with the peace of
          <nobr>Christ.—Letter</nobr> 327, December 10, 1905„ to W. C. White.</p>
