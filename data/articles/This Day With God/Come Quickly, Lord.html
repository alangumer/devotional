    <h1>Come Quickly, Lord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 1 Peter
          4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The end is near, and we must be prepared for what we will have to meet. Our lives must be hid with Christ in
          God. We need the education of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>It is our privilege to be cheerful. At times I have been tempted to feel a depression of soul, as I see how
          blind and mistaken many of our brethren are. It makes my heart ache to think of the men who are unsettled, and
          who have lost their bearings. May the Lord work to remove the cloud of uncertainty, that truth and
          righteousness may prevail. It seems scarcely possible that the power of deception can be so strong. I pity
          these men, but the impression they have made on other minds is so strong that it makes me tremble. A stormy
          future is before us, but we have with us One who is mighty to prevail.</p>
      <p>At times as I see a cloud in the sky, I involuntarily exclaim, “Come, Lord Jesus, and come quickly.” Such times
          as this will reveal character. I long to see the deceptive power of the enemy broken. But we will not let our
          faith fail. The only real comfort I ﬁnd is to look beyond this conﬂict, and see the ﬁnal triumph, the glory of
          God reﬂecting brightness on the overcomers. Prophecy points out the sure result of the conﬂict, and by faith
          we may see it. I long to realize the experiences opened before me in the visions the Lord has given to
          me.</p>
      <p>The restraining power of the Spirit of God is being withdrawn from the earth. Our work must be done quickly. We
          must put forth every effort in our power to save souls from death. Soon the Lord God of heaven will set up His
          kingdom, which shall never be destroyed. Now is the time for us to develop a pure, heavenly character. The
          work will increase more and more in earnestness and intensity until the end. We need an increase of faith. We
          must watch unto prayer.</p>
      <p>For weeks I have been as a cart beneath sheaves, not because I have the least question regarding the work God
          has given me to do, nor because of any desire to shun the responsibilities He has placed upon me; but my heart
          aches for those who are walking in the blindness of error, who have lost their discernment, and who cannot
          distinguish truth from <nobr>error—Letter</nobr> 226, July 8, 1906„ to Elder G.</p>
      <p>I. Butler, a longtime associate in the work and president of the Southern Union Conference.</p>
