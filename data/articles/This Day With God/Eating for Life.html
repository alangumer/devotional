    <h1>Eating for Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.... For</strong></p>
      <p>they are life unto those that ﬁnd them, and health to all their ﬂesh. Proverbs <nobr>4:20-22.</nobr></p>
      <p>Erroneous opinions, arrived at because of faulty education in the home, have been handed down by children to
          children’s children, and habits of indulgence have been fostered which have resulted in ruined health to
          thousands. Our sanitariums are to be places where correct education can be given to many on matters that
          pertain to life and health. The habits of eating should be carefully guarded, that none shall make themselves
          sick by indulgence of appetite. The Lord is not pleased when His people, bought by the sacriﬁce of His beloved
          Son, thoughtlessly injure themselves by wrong habits of living. As we pass through this world, we should seek
          to instruct all who will be taught how to avoid and how to overcome <nobr>self-indulgent</nobr>
          practices.</p>
      <p>If we are believers in Jesus Christ, we shall seek to become intelligent as to how to keep the brain clear and
          active, that not a tittle of our inﬂuence shall be lost. We should seek to become laborers together with God
          by keeping the system in such a condition that it can render perfect service. It is poor policy indeed, to
          <nobr>ill-treat</nobr> the digestive organs, upon which the happiness of the whole being so largely depends.
          When the stomach is disturbed, the mind is disturbed, and the brain nerve power is weakened. It therefore
          becomes a religious duty with every soul to learn the science of healthful living, to keep the question of
          diet in mind, and to treat the matter conscientiously.</p>
      <p>The apostle Paul declares to us that we are not our own, that we are bought with a price. If we truly love the
          One who gave His life for us, we shall feel under solemn obligation to avoid disease....</p>
      <p>The strength of the temptation to indulge perverted appetite can be measured only by the longsuffering of
          Christ in His long fast in the wilderness. Christ knew that in order to carry out the plan of salvation, He
          must begin the work of redemption just where the ruin began. Adam fell on the point of appetite. Christ took
          up the work of redemption just where the ruin began. The same is true of our experience. We are to begin the
          work of reform just where the work of degeneracy is so keenly <nobr>felt.—Letter</nobr> 218, July 16, 1908„ to
          a conference president.</p>
