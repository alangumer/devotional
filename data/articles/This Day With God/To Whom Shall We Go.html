    <h1>To Whom Shall We Go?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
          Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we
          must be saved. Acts 4:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>When so many of Christ’s followers left Him, and the Saviour asked the twelve, “Will ye also go away?” Simon
          Peter answered, “Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life” (John 6:68). It ﬁlled
          Christ’s heart with sorrow to see anyone leaving Him, because He knew that faith in His name and in His
          mission is man’s only hope. This desertion of His followers was a humiliation to Him. Oh, how little human
          beings know of the sorrow that ﬁlled the heart of inﬁnite love when such things took place.</p>
      <p>No one in the world ever longed more earnestly for appreciation and fellowship than did Christ. He hungered for
          sympathy. His heart was ﬁlled with a longing desire that human beings might appreciate the gift of God to the
          world, and honor Him by believing His words and speaking forth His praise. “God so loved the world, that he
          gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”
          (John 3:16).</p>
      <p>How regretful were the words, “Will ye also go away?” They touched the hearts of all the disciples but one.
          That one was Judas. He had a heart only for money. His highest desire was to be the greatest.</p>
      <p>Well might the disciples say, “Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.” Consider what
          Christ was. The Son of the Highest, yet a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Have we experienced the
          blessing that comes from trusting Him with the whole heart, and honoring Him by ever showing our love and
          devotion to Him? Christ is hungry for <nobr>fruit—fruit</nobr> that will appease His hunger of soul in our
          behalf. It is His desire that we bear “much fruit.”</p>
      <p>Let us keep our hearts open to His love. “What shall it proﬁt a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
          his own soul?” (Mark 8:36). Oh, when we can speak understandingly the words spoken by Peter, “Lord, to whom
          shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life,” wonderful blessings will come to <nobr>us.—Letter</nobr>
