    <h1>The Cost of Salvation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom
          the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. Hebrews 12:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is our example. He was exposed to hardship. He endured suffering, He humbled Himself to humanity. Christ
          bore His burdens without impatience, without unbelief, without repining. He felt His trials none the less
          because He was the divine Son of God. You have not a trouble, perplexity, or difﬁculty which did not press
          with equal weight upon the Son of God; not a sorrow to which His heart was not equally exposed. His feelings
          were hurt as easily as yours. Again the life and character of Christ were faultless. His character was
          composed of moral excellencies, including everything pure, and true, and lovely, and of good report.</p>
      <p>God has given us a perfect, faultless pattern. God designed to make of you an able, efﬁcient workman. The mind
          He designed should be puriﬁed, elevated, ennobled. If the mind is allowed to be exercised with small things,
          it will be feeble as the result of unchanging laws. God wants His servants to enlarge the scope of their
          thoughts and plans of labor and bring their powers into vigorous contact with things that are grand,
          elevating, ennobling. This will give new springs to the intellectual faculties. His thoughts will take broad
          scope and he will gird up his energies for the task of a broader, deeper, grander work, swimming in deep and
          broad waters where there is no bottom or shore....</p>
      <p>God sees men’s hearts and characters when they do not see their own state correctly. He sees that His work and
          cause will suffer if wrongs are not corrected that exist in themselves unobserved and therefore uncorrected.
          Christ calls us His servants, if we do what He commands us. There is to every man assigned his particular
          sphere, place, and work, and God asks no more and no less from the lowliest, as well as the greatest, than
          that they fulﬁll their calling. We are not our own property. We have become servants of Christ by grace. We
          are the purchase of the blood of the Son of <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 16, June 6, 1875„ to Elder G.</p>
      <p>I. Butler, former president of the General Conference.</p>
