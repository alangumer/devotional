    <h1>Importance of Home Religion</h1>

      <p><strong>I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. Hebrews
          2:13.</strong></p>
      <p>There is need of constant watchfulness, a daily reconversion, that our individual traits of character shall be
          wholly sanctiﬁed to God. All our powers are to be puriﬁed from the dross of sin, and trained for service.
          There are many who, while professing to be the servants of God, and to be looking for the soon return of
          Christ, are not having the experience that all must have who stand without fault before God. They are making
          mistakes in the work of character building. To continue to make these mistakes is a costly business, for they
          hinder the progress in the divine life.</p>
      <p>Our religious obligations begin in serving God faithfully in the home life. I am urged to bear earnest
          testimony to parents in public and private, that they may be led to devote all their powers in sanctiﬁed
          service for Christ. I am instructed to urge upon our people the need of being imbued with the Spirit of God.
          This Spirit will teach believers to work in harmony with Christ whenever and wherever opportunity offers. As
          different families among our people have been presented before me, I have been shown their great need of the
          converting power of God....</p>
      <p>Religion in the home is of vital importance. Upon fathers and mothers rest to a large degree the responsibility
          for the mold of character that their children receive.... If parents will teach their children to conduct
          themselves according</p>
      <p>to the principles of the Word of God, these children will unconsciously teach others what it means to be
          Christians. Let parents maintain true Christian dignity before their children, and they will be greatly aided
          in their work of upbuilding the kingdom of Christ.</p>
      <p>The apostle Paul, describing the children living in these last days, declares them to be “disobedient to
          parents, unthankful, unholy.” It is important that parents realize the tendency of the age, and labor
          untiringly to educate their children away from those things, preparing them, by teaching them to love and copy
          the life of Christ, for a place in the future life of <nobr>holiness.—Letter</nobr> 90, October 25, 1911„ to
          Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell.</p>
