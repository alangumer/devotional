      <p><strong>Learn ﬁrst to shew piety at home. 1 Timothy 5:4.</strong></p>
      <p>It has become customary in many families, with parents as well as with children, to be more pleasant when in
          the society of others than in their own home. This is not the plan that God has devised for parents and
          children. Save some of your smiles and praise and courtesy for the home circle. You should strive to be
          tender, thoughtful, kind, to exercise Christian politeness in the home. The gracious spirit of home religion
          is to be cultivated....</p>
      <p>Christ never spoke a harsh or an unkind word. When tempted by His associates to do wrong, He would sing from
          the Psalm, or by some word of Scripture would discourage the enemy. Do not be ashamed to learn of Christ. He
          invites you, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest
          unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew 11:29, 30). When you feel provoked to
          anger consider that in manifesting this spirit, you are not wearing the yoke of Christ, which is one of
          obedience, restraint, service.</p>
      <p>Parents and children, bear this in mind, that the true followers of Christ will make their home as nearly as
          possible a symbol of the home above, for in doing this they are coworkers with Christ to carry out the laws of
          His kingdom. Read the prayer that Christ taught His disciples. Live that prayer. It is a whole sermon for all
          who would practice it. We have something to ask of Jesus. We have great wants and great necessities, which He
          alone can supply. The prayer which Christ taught His disciples covers all these needs. We want pardon,
          forgiveness; but we can have it only as we shall pardon and forgive others.</p>
      <p>Christ invites your conﬁdence. Of yourself you can do nothing. You cannot be kind, true, courteous, unselﬁsh,
          without the Holy Spirit’s help.... Study</p>
      <p>the life of Christ, and practice in the home life those things which you know will be required of you in the
          heavenly life, in the society of the heavenly family. In the home circle here we may practice our manners for
          the family <nobr>above.—Manuscript</nobr> 125, October 6, 1898„ “Education in the Home.”</p>
