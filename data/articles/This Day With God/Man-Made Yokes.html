      <p><strong>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are
          one body: so also is Christ. 1 Corinthians 12:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Soon the old year, with its burden of record, will have passed into eternity, and the new year will have begun.
          Let us gather up the treasures of the past year, and carry with us into the new year the remembrance of God’s
          goodness and mercy. Let us brighten the future by the thought of past blessings.</p>
      <p>“Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do
          of his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:12, 13). We must cooperate with the Lord Jesus. Only thus shall we be
          able to accomplish our part of the work. We are to hold fast to all we gain through Christ.</p>
      <p>O what wonderful advantages and opportunities there are for those who wear Christ’s yoke! Our troubles come
          because we manufacture yokes for ourselves, refusing to wear Christ’s yoke. He is our efﬁciency. He will give
          us power. Our part is to plant our feet ﬁrmly on the platform of eternal truth; then we may know that over us
          is the protection of God.</p>
      <p>“Therefore being justiﬁed by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). To be
          justiﬁed means to be pardoned. To those whom God justiﬁes He imputes Christ’s righteousness, for the Saviour
          has taken away our sin. We stand before the throne of God justiﬁed and sanctiﬁed. We are emptied of self, and,
          through the sanctiﬁcation of the truth, Christ abides in our hearts....</p>
      <p>We are being tried and tested. May the Lord of heaven shut us in with Him, that the wicked one may have no
          power over us....</p>
      <p>Christ is the great Master Worker. We are laborers together with Him. He has a right to give each one his work.
          And let each one be sure to do the work given him. Let us do faithfully the work that the Lord has placed in
          our minds. He who neglects his deﬁnite work for the work that some one else has in charge is out of place.
          Time is lost, conﬁdence abused and shaken, and the work hindered. When we learn to attend closely to our own
          special work, the Lord will help us, and all parts of His cause will move in <nobr>harmony.—Letter</nobr> 202,
          December 15, 1902„ to “My Dear Brethren and Sisters.”</p>
