    <h1>Making Your Trial Balance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 1 Thessalonians 5:21. Brethren, we must sink the shaft
          deep in the mine of truth. You may question</strong></p>
      <p>matters with yourselves and with one another, if you only do it in the right spirit; but too often self is
          large, and as soon as investigation begins, an unchristian spirit is manifested. This is just what Satan
          delights in, but we should come with a humble heart to know for ourselves what is truth. The time is coming
          when we shall be separated and scattered, and each one of us will have to stand without the privilege of
          communion with those of like precious faith; and how can you stand unless God is by your side, and you know
          that He is leading and guiding you? Whenever we come to investigate Bible truth, the Master of assemblies is
          with us. The Lord does not leave the ship one moment to be steered by ignorant pilots. We may receive our
          orders from the Captain of our salvation....</p>
      <p>If a brother is teaching error, those who are in responsible positions ought to know it; and if he is teaching
          truth, they ought to take their stand at his side. We should all know what is being taught among us, for if it
          is truth, we need to know it. The Sabbath school teacher needs to know it, and every Sabbath school scholar
          ought to understand it. We are all under obligation to God to know what He sends to us. He has given
          directions by which we may test every <nobr>doctrine—“To</nobr> the law and to the testimony: if they speak
          not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20). But if it is according to
          this test, do not be so full of prejudice that you cannot acknowledge a point when it is proved to you, simply
          because it does not agree with your ideas.</p>
      <p>Do not catch at every objection, however small, and make it as large as possible, and preserve it for future
          use. No one has said that we shall ﬁnd perfection in any man’s investigations, but this I do know, that our
          churches are dying for the want of teaching on the subject of righteousness by faith in Christ, and for
          kindred truths.</p>
      <p>No matter by whom light is sent, we should open our hearts to receive it in the meekness of
          <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 25, 1890.</p>
