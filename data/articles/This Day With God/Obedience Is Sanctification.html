    <h1>Obedience Is Sanctiﬁcation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a
          sacriﬁce to God for a <nobr>sweet-smelling</nobr> savour. Ephesians 5:2.</strong></p>
      <p>In all the fullness of His divinity, in all the glory of His spotless humanity, Christ gave Himself for us as a
          full and free sacriﬁce, and each one who comes to Him should accept Him as if he were the only one for whom
          the price had been paid. As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive, for the obedient will be
          raised to immortality, and the transgressor will rise from the dead to suffer death, the penalty of the law
          which he has broken.</p>
      <p>Obedience to the law of God is sanctiﬁcation. There are many who have erroneous ideas in regard to this work in
          the soul, but Jesus prayed that His disciples might be sanctiﬁed through the truth, and added, “Thy word is
          truth.” Sanctiﬁcation is not an instantaneous but a progressive work, as obedience is continuous. Just as long
          as Satan urges his temptations upon us, the battle for <nobr>self-conquest</nobr> will have to be fought over
          and over again; but by obedience, the truth will sanctify the soul. Those who are loyal to the truth will,
          through the merits of Christ, overcome all weakness of character which has led them to be molded by every
          varying circumstance of life.</p>
      <p>Many have taken the position that they cannot sin because they are sanctiﬁed, but this is a delusive snare of
          the evil one. There is constant danger of falling into sin, for Christ has warned us to watch and pray lest we
          enter into temptation. If we are conscious of the weakness of self, we shall not be <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr>
          and reckless of danger, but we shall feel the necessity of seeking to the Source of our strength, Jesus our
          righteousness. We shall come in repentance and contrition, with a despairing sense of our own ﬁnite weakness,
          and learn that we must daily apply to the merits of the blood of Christ, that we may become vessels ﬁt for the
          Master’s use. While thus depending upon God, we shall not be found warring against the truth, but we shall
          always be enabled to take our stand for the right. We should cling to the teaching of the Bible, and not
          follow the customs and traditions of the world, the sayings and doings of <nobr>men.—The</nobr> Signs of the
          Times, May 19, 1890.</p>
