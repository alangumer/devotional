    <h1>God Loves the Beautiful</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let all things be done decently and in order. 1 Corinthians 14:40.</strong></p>
      <p>God is not gloriﬁed by those whom He has called out of darkness into His marvelous light being untidy,
          careless, and slovenly. We want to copy the heavenly Pattern as far as order and neatness are concerned, and,
          if heaven is desirable and attractive, I want that my premises shall be attractive in their simplicity and
          order. We all need to consider that thoroughness, neatness, and order should prevail among those who love and
          fear God, for in this we are recommending our faith.</p>
      <p>We are making an impression upon the beholders. Our connection with God will increase our desire to be cleanly
          in our houses and about our premises. Fruit trees, ornamental trees, and ﬂowers cultivated about our
          dwellings, pay in more ways than one.</p>
      <p>The Lord is a lover of the beautiful, for He has made the lofty trees, the spears of grass, the beautiful
          shrubs, the delicate ﬂowers, and all these have a softening, subduing inﬂuence upon the beholder, and, as
          their senses are charmed, they are involuntarily drawn from nature to nature’s God. If the Lord is mindful of
          us in giving us this expression of His love in the variety of beautiful ﬂowers growing in their natural
          loveliness, shall we not be grateful to Him? Shall we not do just as Jesus told us to do, “Consider the lilies
          of the ﬁeld, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in
          all his glory was not arrayed like one of these” (Matthew 6:28, 29). Here the Lord contrasts the artiﬁcial
          with the natural....</p>
      <p>I expend wisely some means to have God’s precious things in my sight and to have everything healthful about my
          premises. I do this that all may see we do not, because of our faith, descend to commonness, and become lax
          and loose and untidy....</p>
      <p>Let all see that, because you believe the Lord is coming, you are preparing for a pure and holy heaven by being
          pure and cleanly and holy here. Then you will be at home when called to the holy mansions above. What saith
          the Lord to us through His inspired apostle? “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
          nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him” (1 Peter
          <nobr>2:9).—Manuscript</nobr> 28, November 18, 1889„ “A Signiﬁcant Dream.”</p>
