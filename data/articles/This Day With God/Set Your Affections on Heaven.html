    <h1>Set Your Affections on Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid
          with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
          Colossians <nobr>3:2-4.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>We need to have a broader view of the Saviour as “Lord and Christ.” “All power” is given to Him to give to
          those who claim to believe in His name. We do not half acknowledge His right to our homage and obedience, and
          to our increasing faith in Him....</p>
      <p>“Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,” the apostle continues, “bowels of mercies, kindness,
          humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
          have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</p>
      <p>“And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in
          your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in
          you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
          singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (Colossians <nobr>3:12-16)....</nobr></p>
      <p>Put yourself under discipline to Christ. Be led by His word. Heed His instruction, “Take my yoke upon you, and
          learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:29).</p>
      <p>I beseech the churches in every place to make thorough work for eternity by confession and putting away of
          sins. “His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness” (2 Peter 1:3). By
          what means? “Through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.” “We all, with open face
          beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory” (2
          Corinthians 3:18).</p>
      <p>God and Christ alone know what the souls of men have cost. For our sakes the Son of God became poor, that we
          through His poverty might be made rich with eternal riches. His love is without a
          <nobr>parallel.—Letter</nobr> 318, October 8, 1907„ to Elder O. A. Olsen, president of the Australian Union
          Conference.</p>
