    <h1>What Love Does</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. Psalm
          146:2.</strong></p>
      <p>For half a century I have been the Lord’s messenger, and as long as my life shall last I shall continue to bear
          the messages that God gives me for His people. I take no glory to myself; in my youth the Lord made me His
          messenger, to communicate to His people testimonies of encouragement, warning, and reproof. For sixty years I
          have been in communication with heavenly messengers, and I have been constantly learning in reference to
          divine things, and in reference to the way in which God is constantly working to bring souls from the error of
          their ways to the light in God’s light ....</p>
      <p>I love God. I love Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and I feel an intense interest in every soul who claims to be
          a child of God. I am determined to be a faithful steward so long as the Lord shall spare my life. I will not
          fail nor be discouraged.</p>
      <p>But for months my soul has been passing through intense agony on account of those who have received the
          sophistries of Satan [pantheistic teachings; see Testimonies for the Church <nobr>8:255-304]</nobr> and are
          communicating the same to others, making every conceivable interpretation in various ways to destroy conﬁdence
          in the gospel messages for this last generation, and in the special work which God has given me to do. I know
          that the Lord has given me this work, and I have no excuse to make for what I have done. In my experience I am
          constantly receiving evidence of the sustaining <nobr>miracle-working</nobr> power of God upon my body and my
          soul, which I have dedicated to the Lord. I am not my own; I have been bought with a price. And I have such
          assurance of the Lord’s working in my behalf that I must acknowledge His abundant grace. I love the Lord; I
          love my Saviour, and my life is wholly in the hands of God. As long as He sustains me, I shall bear a decided
          testimony.</p>
      <p>Why should I complain? So many times has the Lord raised me up from sickness, so wonderfully has He sustained
          me, that I can never doubt. I have so many unmistakable evidences of His special blessings, that I could not
          possibly doubt. He gives me freedom to speak His truth before large numbers of <nobr>people.—Letter</nobr> 86,
          March 8, 1906„ to Elder G. I. Butler, president of the Southern Union Conference.</p>
