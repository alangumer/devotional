    <h1>Observing Christmas</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and
          they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold I bring you good tidings of great
          joy, which shall be to all people. Luke 2:9, 10.</strong></p>
      <p>The 25th of December has long been commemorated as the day of Jesus’ birth, and ...it is not my purpose to
          afﬁrm or question the propriety of celebrating this event on this day, but to dwell upon the childhood and
          life of our Saviour. It is my purpose to call the attention of the children to the humble manner in which the
          Redeemer came to the world.</p>
      <p>All heaven was interested in the great event of Christ’s advent to earth. Heavenly messengers came to make
          known the birth of the <nobr>long-promised,</nobr><nobr>long-expected</nobr> Saviour to the humble shepherds
          who were watching their ﬂocks by night on the plains of Bethlehem. The ﬁrst manifestation that attracted the
          notice of the shepherds at the birth of the Saviour, was a radiant light in the starry heavens, which ﬁlled
          them with wonder and admiration.... The astonished</p>
      <p>shepherds could scarcely comprehend the precious message borne to them by the angels, and when the radiant
          light had passed away, they said one to another, “Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which
          is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph,
          and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told
          them concerning this child” (Luke <nobr>2:15-17)....</nobr></p>
      <p>What matchless love Jesus has manifested for a fallen world! If angels sang because the Saviour was born in
          Bethlehem, shall not our hearts echo the glad strain, Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, good will
          to men? Although we do not know the exact day of Christ’s birth, we would honor the sacred event. May the Lord
          forbid that any one should be so narrow minded as to overlook the event because there is an uncertainty in
          regard to the exact time. Let us do what we can to fasten the minds of the children upon those things which
          are precious to everyone who loves Jesus. Let us teach them how Jesus came into the world to bring hope,
          comfort, peace, and happiness to all.... Let the hearts of all respond</p>
      <p>with exceeding joy for the priceless gift of the Son of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 17,
          1889.</p>
