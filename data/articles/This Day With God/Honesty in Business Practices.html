    <h1>Honesty in Business Practices</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord. Romans 12:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The servants of God are obliged to be more or less connected with the worldly by business transactions, but
          they should buy and sell with a realization that the eye of God is upon them. No false balances or deceitful
          weights are to be used, for these are an abomination to the Lord. In every business transaction a Christian
          will be just what he wants his brethren to think he is. His course of action is guided by underlying
          principles. He does not scheme, therefore, he has nothing to conceal, nothing to gloss over. He may be
          criticized, he may be tested, but his unbending integrity will shine forth like pure gold. He is a blessing to
          all connected with him, for his word is trustworthy. He is a man who will not take an advantage of his
          neighbor. He is a friend and benefactor to all, and his fellow men put conﬁdence in his counsel....</p>
      <p>A truly honest man will never take advantage of weakness or incompetency in order to ﬁll his own purse. He
          accepts a fair equivalent for that which he sells. If there are defects in the articles sold, he frankly tells
          his brother or his neighbor, although by so doing he may work against his own pecuniary interests. In all the
          details of life the strictest principles of honesty are to be maintained. These are not the principles which
          govern our world, for <nobr>Satan—deceiver,</nobr> liar, and <nobr>oppressor—is</nobr> the master, and his
          subjects follow him and carry out his purposes. But Christians serve under a different Master, and their
          actions must be wrought in God, irrespective of all selﬁsh gain. Deviation from perfect fairness in a business
          deal may appear as a small thing in the estimation of some, but our Saviour did not thus regard it. His words
          on this point are plain and explicit: “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much”
          (Luke 16:10)....</p>
      <p>In the Christian world today fraud is practiced to a fearful extent. God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr>
          people should show that they are above all these things. The dishonest practices which mar the dealing of man
          with his fellow man should never be practiced by one who professes to be a believer in present
          <nobr>truth.—Letter</nobr> 3, November 24, 1878„ to Brother O, a colporteur given to questionable business
          practices.</p>
