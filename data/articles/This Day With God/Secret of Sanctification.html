    <h1>Secret of Sanctiﬁcation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light
          of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 4:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ commissions us to shine as lights in the world, by reﬂecting the light of God as seen in the face of
          Jesus Christ. Who among us is doing this? Are our lives all aglow with this wondrous light? God expects every
          one of us to reﬂect His image to the world. We have been led on step by step to make advancement. We have
          walked and worked by faith, and we need to discipline ourselves to endure hardship as good soldiers of Jesus
          Christ.</p>
      <p>We want good, strong minds that are not easily discouraged, minds that are educated to grapple with the
          difﬁculties we shall meet, and wrestle with and conquer hard problems. We must lift the standard of truth in
          the towns and cities around us. We must see what is to be done and do it in the love and fear of God. When we
          have gone just as far as we can by faith, then the Lord will undertake in our behalf. It is God who has
          inspired us to commence this work. We have gone forward step by step, praying, believing, working. God is the
          author of our faith, and when we each act our individual part, He perfects the work, glorifying His own name
          in the ﬁnishing of it. The Lord inspires His consecrated workmen to work not from what they see but from what
          the Lord sees.</p>
      <p>We need to strengthen our souls with hope, the twin sister of faith. God’s workers must live in perfect
          submission to the will of God. There is danger of working at cross purposes with God, for man wants to work
          his way, which he supposes is the very best way in which to bring about the purposes of God. But we cannot
          have our own way and will. God must work in us and by us and through us. We are to be in the hands of God as
          clay in the hands of the potter, for Him to mold after the divine similitude.</p>
      <p>Our hearts need to be wholly sanctiﬁed to God. Let us not seek to retain our own way and will. God has given us
          His truth, that it may sanctify, reﬁne, and ennoble the whole man. “This is the will of God” concerning you,
          He said, “even your sanctiﬁcation” (1 Thessalonians 4:3). “His divine power hath given unto us all things that
          pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue” (2
          Peter <nobr>1:3).—Manuscript</nobr> 70, February 26, 1899„ “Laborers Together With God”</p>
