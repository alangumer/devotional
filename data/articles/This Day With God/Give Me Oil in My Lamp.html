      <p><strong>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Zechariah 4:6.</strong></p>
      <p>We need not think that because we are only a tiny light, that we need not be particular about shining. The
          great value of our light lies in its consistency in shining amid the moral darkness of the world, in shining
          not to please ourselves and glorify ourselves, but to honor God with all there is of us. If we are doing
          service for God, and our work is corresponding with the ability God has given us, that is all He expects of
          us....</p>
      <p>We know that the lamps which give us light have no light in themselves. They cannot ﬁll themselves. So the holy
          appointed ones must empty the golden oil into the golden tubes. And the heavenly ﬁre, when applied, makes them
          burning and shining lights. Our hearts cannot reﬂect light until there is a vital connection with heaven. This
          alone can make them burn steadily with holy, unselﬁsh love for Jesus, and for all who are the purchase of His
          blood. And unless we are constantly replenished with the golden oil, the ﬂame will die out. Unless the love of
          God is an abiding principle in our hearts, our light will go out....</p>
      <p>Satan and his confederate angels point to those who profess to be children of God, but who by their disposition
          and actions show that they are after the similitude of the apostate, and taunt Christ and the heavenly angels.
          How long shall we thus crucify the Son of God afresh, so that God is ashamed to call us His sons and
          daughters? Is it not time that we put away childish things? Shall we be of the number who are ever learning,
          yet never able to come to a knowledge of the truth?</p>
      <p>It is the golden oil that the heavenly messengers empty into the golden tubes, to be conducted into the golden
          bowl, that creates a continuous, bright and shining light. It is the love of God continually transferred to
          the human agent that keeps him a bright and shining light for God. Then he can communicate light and truth to
          all who are in darkness and error and sin. The golden oil is not manufactured by any human skill. It is the
          unseen power of the holy messengers who wait before the throne of God to communicate to everyone who is in
          darkness that they may diffuse heaven’s light. Into the hearts of those united to God by faith, His golden oil
          of love ﬂows <nobr>freely.—Manuscript</nobr> 27, March 30, 1897„ “The Church a Repository of Truth.”</p>
