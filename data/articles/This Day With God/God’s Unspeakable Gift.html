    <h1>God’s Unspeakable Gift</h1>

      <p><strong>Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. 2 Corinthians 9:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Last night the Christmas [Eve] celebration was held in the [Battle Creek] Tabernacle, and it passed off
          <nobr>well—modestly,</nobr> solemnly, and with gratitude expressed in everything done and said, because Jesus
          the Prince of Life had come to our world a babe in Bethlehem to be an offering for sin. He came to fulﬁll the
          prediction of the prophets and seers, which He had instructed them to utter to fulﬁll the counsels of heaven,
          and in the great mission and work verify His own word. And for this, every soul is under the most solemn
          obligation and gratitude to God, that Jesus, the world’s Redeemer, has pledged Himself to accomplish the full
          salvation of every son and daughter of Adam. If they do not accept the heavenly gift, they have only
          themselves to blame. The sacriﬁce was ample, wholly consistent with the justice and honor of God’s holy law.
          The Innocent suffered for the guilty, and this should call forth gratitude full and complete.</p>
      <p>At half past ten [December 25] I spoke to those assembled at the Tabernacle. The Lord gave me most earnest
          words to speak. I tried to present the matter in the light of God’s Word, that the work of labor for the
          salvation of souls does not rest alone upon the delegated minister, but that to every man God had given his
          work. The Lord’s work is to be carried forward by the living members of Christ’s body, and in the great divine
          appointment of God each one is to be educated to act a part in the conversion of souls. He has enlisted in the
          army of the Lord, not for ease, not to study his own amusement, but to endure hardships as a faithful soldier
          of the cross of Christ. Every private must act his part, be vigilant, be courageous, be true. After I had
          occupied about ﬁfty minutes, many excellent testimonies were borne.</p>
      <p>We returned home and called to our dinner, Fred Walling, my niece’s son, his wife, his wife’s mother, and they
          came with their two little ones, a babe of three months, and a boy of six years. These were strangers and
          poor, and needed this little <nobr>encouragement.—Manuscript</nobr> 24, December 25, 1889„ diary.</p>
