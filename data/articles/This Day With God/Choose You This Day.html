    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Choose you this day whom ye will serve. Joshua 24:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The wind is increasing until it blows a gale. I do not venture upon the deck [of the steamer Wairarapa]. I feel
          glad to keep still....</p>
      <p>I was lifting up my heart to God for Christ, who stilled the tempest, to say “Peace, be still.”</p>
      <p>All at once the rainbow spanned the heavens. I could see the signs of God’s promise in the bow in the clouds,
          and I was resting in conﬁdence in His protecting arms....</p>
      <p>The lady in waiting [i.e., stewardess nurse] is very kind to me. I gave her Steps to Christ and some papers and
          pamphlets. I talked with her in regard to her soul’s salvation. I pointed out the perils of anyone whose life
          was on the sea. She said she had thought of this ofttimes, but she said, “If I could, I would be a Christian,
          but I cannot. It would be an impossibility to serve God on such a vessel as this. You do not know, you cannot
          have any idea of the wickedness of these sailors. The captain and mates are so closely of the same character
          with the crew of sailors that they have no inﬂuence to introduce reform, if they desired such a thing.” I
          asked why she did not seek some other employment. She said, “It would be no use. I have four children to
          support and I have not strength to do hard work.” She was a small, delicate, <nobr>ﬁne-featured</nobr>
          woman....</p>
      <p>I tried to open before her the danger of living a prayerless life. She said, “It is no use to pray here, or try
          to be religious.” I told her if the Lord had appointed her that place she would, if she would accept Christ as
          her Saviour, realize Christ as her refuge. She said, with tears in her eyes, “It is impossible. I know the
          company on this ship. I could not live religion here. I hope some time to have some place opened for me where
          I can support my family, and then I shall give my attention to serious things. If I could only be with my
          children and support them in a humble way I would only too gladly choose to do <nobr>so.”—Manuscript</nobr>
