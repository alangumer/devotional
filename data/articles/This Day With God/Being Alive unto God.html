    <h1>Being Alive unto God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
          heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
          Matthew 10:32, 33.</strong></p>
      <p>How is it? Are we confessing Christ in our daily life? Do we confess Him in our dress, adorning ourselves with
          plain and modest apparel? Is our adorning that of the meek and quiet spirit which is of so great price in the
          sight of God? Are we seeking to advance the cause of the Master? Is the line of demarcation between you and
          the world distinct, or are you seeking to follow the fashions of this degenerate age? Is there no difference
          between you and the worldling? Does the same spirit work in you that works in the children of
          disobedience?</p>
      <p>If we are Christians, we shall follow Christ, even though the path in which we are to walk cuts right across
          our natural inclinations. There is no use in telling you that you must not wear this or that, for if the love
          of these vain things is in your heart, your laying off your adornments will only be like cutting the foliage
          off a tree. The inclinations of the natural heart would again assert themselves. You must have a conscience of
          your own.</p>
      <p>O, did we remember that Christ became poor, that we through His poverty might become rich, would we not seek to
          honor His name, and advance His cause? We are to abide in Him as the branch abides in the vine. Jesus says, “I
          am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for
          without me ye can do nothing.... Herein is</p>
      <p>my Father gloriﬁed, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples” (John <nobr>15:5-8).</nobr></p>
      <p>If we fulﬁlled this command of our Lord, there would be a different state of affairs in our churches, and we
          should know what it is to have the deep movings of the Spirit of God. What we want is to have the ax laid at
          the root of the tree. We want to be dead to the world, dead to self, and alive unto God. Our life must be his
          with Christ in God, that when He shall appear, we also may appear with Him in glory. We need to come close to
          Christ, that men may know that we have been with Christ and learned of Him.... Keep your eye ﬁxed upon
          Christ.</p>
      <p>With humility of mind seek for a nearness to God. In words, in conduct, in life, confess
          <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 10, 1892.</p>
