    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
          ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. Titus
          2:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>The angels of God attain unto no higher knowledge than to know the will of God; and it is their greatest
          delight to accomplish the perfect will of the heavenly Father. Fallen man has the privilege of becoming
          intelligent in regard to the will of God. While probationary time is granted us, we should put our faculties
          to the very highest use, that we may make of ourselves all that it is possible; and while we endeavor to reach
          a high standard of intelligence, we should feel our dependence upon God, for without His grace, our efforts
          cannot bring lasting beneﬁt. It is through the grace of Christ that we are to be overcomers; through the
          merits of His blood we are to be of that number whose names will not be blotted out of the book of life. Those
          who are ﬁnal overcomers will have the life that runs parallel with the life of God, and wear the crown of the
          victor. When such great and eternal reward awaits us, we should run the race with patience, looking unto
          Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of our faith.</p>
      <p>We have no hesitancy in telling you that in order to obtain the immortal inheritance and the eternal substance,
          you must be overcomers in this probationary life. Everything that blots and stains the soul must be removed,
          must be cleansed from the heart. We must know what it means to be a partaker of the divine nature, having
          escaped the corruptions that are in the world through lust. Are you willing to wage war against the lusts of
          the ﬂesh? Are you ready to battle against the enemy of God and man? Satan is determined to enslave every soul
          if he can; for he is playing a desperate game to win the souls of men from Christ and eternal life. Will you
          permit him to steal from you the graces of the Spirit of God, and plant in you his own corrupt nature? or will
          you accept the great provision of salvation, and through the merits of the Inﬁnite Sacriﬁce made in your
          behalf, become a partaker of the divine nature? God has given His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son, that through
          His shame, suffering, and death, you might have glory, honor, and <nobr>immortality.—The</nobr> Signs of the
          Times, June 15, 1891.</p>
