    <h1>Copying Christ’s Methods</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they
          that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Mark 2:17.</strong></p>
      <p>No teacher ever placed such signal honor upon man as did our Lord and Master. He was known as a “friend of
          publicans and sinners.” He mingled with all classes of society, that all might partake of the blessings He
          came to bestow. He was found in the synagogue and in the market place. He shared the social life of His
          countrymen, gladdening with His presence the households of all who invited Him. But He never urged His way
          uninvited.</p>
      <p>He was active to relieve every species of human misery that was brought to Him in faith for relief; but He did
          not bestow healing power indiscriminately where there was manifested an independence and selﬁsh exclusiveness
          that would give no expression to their sorrows nor ask for the help so much needed. All who came unto Him in
          faith He was ready and willing to relieve. Sorrow ﬂed at His presence; injustice and oppression withered
          beneath His rebukes; and death, the cruel spoiler of our sinful race, obeyed His commands.</p>
      <p>In every age since Christ was among men, there have been some who, while they professed His name, have pursued
          a course of seclusion or of Pharisaical preeminence. But they have not blessed their fellow men. They have
          found no excuse in the life of Christ for this <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> bigotry; for His character was
          genial and beneﬁcent. He would have been excluded from every monastic order upon earth because of overstepping
          their prescribed rules. In every church and denomination are to be found erratics who would have blamed Him
          for His liberal mercies....</p>
      <p>Those with whom God has entrusted His truth must so order their intercourse with the world as to secure to
          themselves a calm, hallowed peace, as well as a sacred and most thorough knowledge of how to meet men with
          their prejudices where they are, and minister to them the light, comfort, and peace found in the acceptance of
          the truth of God. They should take for example the inspiring, authoritative and social life of Christ. They
          must cultivate the same beneﬁcent spirit which He possessed, and must cherish the same broad plans of action
          in meeting men where they <nobr>are.—Letter</nobr> 2, August 28, 1878„ to “Dear Brethren [in
          Switzerland].”</p>
