    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked,
          and they see his shame. Revelation 16:15.</strong></p>
      <p>A terrible contest is before us. We are nearing the battle of the great day of God Almighty. That which has
          been held in control is to be let loose. The angel of mercy is folding its wings, preparing to step down from
          the golden throne and leave the world to the control of Satan, the king it has chosen, a murderer and a
          destroyer from the beginning.</p>
      <p>The principalities and powers of earth are in bitter revolt against the God of heaven. They are ﬁlled with
          hatred against all who serve Him, and soon, very soon, is to be fought the last great battle between good and
          evil. The earth is to be the <nobr>battleﬁeld—the</nobr> scene of the ﬁnal contest and the ﬁnal victory. Here,
          where for so long Satan has led men against God, rebellion is to be forever suppressed.</p>
      <p>Christ came to this earth in human form that He might stand as the Captain of our salvation, so that we should
          not be overcome by Satan’s power. And when the enemy has seemed to be gaining a signal victory over
          righteousness, God has been working in mercy and power to counteract his designs.</p>
      <p>Determined to efface the image of God in man, Satan works with an intensity of effort to hide God from view.
          Not openly does he work, but secretly, mingling the human and the divine, the spurious and the genuine, so
          seeking to bring confusion and distress. But in proportionate power divine mercy is revealed to counteract
          this wicked working, and bring to light the enemy’s hidden purposes.</p>
      <p>God’s people are to hear a bold, decided testimony for the truth, unfolding the purposes of God by the witness
          of pen and voice. In place after place they are to proclaim the message of God’s Word, arousing men and women
          to comprehend the truth....</p>
      <p>There is a reality in sound doctrine. It is not as a vapor, which passes away. Light is to shine forth from the
          Word of God. God calls upon His people to draw near to Him. Let no one interpose between Him and His people.
          Christ is knocking at the door of the heart, seeking for entrance. Will you let Him <nobr>in?—Letter</nobr>
