      <p><strong>And unto one he gave ﬁve talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his
          several ability. Matthew 25:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Study the instruction found in Matthew <nobr>25:14-46.</nobr> Compare this instruction with your life record.
          Let every man put away his boasting.... Let us walk in the</p>
      <p>footsteps of Christ in all the humility of true faith. Let us put away all <nobr>self-trust,</nobr> committing
          ourselves, day by day and hour by hour, to the Saviour, constantly receiving and imparting His grace. I beg
          those who profess to believe in Christ to walk humbly before God. Pride and <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> are
          an offense to Him. “If any man will come after me,” Christ declares, “let him deny himself, and take up his
          cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24). Those only who obey this word will He recognize as His believing ones.
          “As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
          name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the ﬂesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” (John
          1:12, 13).</p>
      <p>“And the Word was made ﬂesh, and dwelt among us” (Verse 14). O wonderful condescension! The Prince of heaven,
          the Commander of the heavenly hosts, stepped down from His high position, laid aside His royal robe and kingly
          crown, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might become the divine Teacher of all classes of men,
          and live before human beings a life free from all selﬁshness and sin, setting them an example of what, through
          His grace, they may become.</p>
      <p>“The Word was made ﬂesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
          Father,) full of grace and truth” (Verse 14). Praise God for this wonderful statement. The possibilities that
          it presents seem almost too great for us to grasp, and put to shame our weakness and our unbelief. I praise
          God that I can see my Saviour by faith. My soul grasps the great gift. Our only hope in this life is to reach
          forth the hand of faith, and grasp the hand outstretched to save. “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
          the sin of the world” (Verse 29). If we would look away from self to Jesus, making Him our Guide, the world
          would see in our churches a power that it does not now <nobr>see.—Manuscript</nobr> 166, December 30, 1905„
