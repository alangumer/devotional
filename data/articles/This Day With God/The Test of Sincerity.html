    <h1>The Test of Sincerity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. James 1:22.</strong></p>
      <p>Of every soul the Lord demands service. Those to whom the living oracles have been opened, who see the truth,
          and yield themselves body, soul, and spirit to God will understand the words of the Saviour, “Go work to day
          in my vineyard” (Matthew 21:28), to be a requirement, but not a compulsory one. God’s will is made known in
          His Word, and those who believe in Christ will act out their belief. They will be doers of the Word.</p>
      <p>The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds. Christ does not say to any man, “What say ye more than
          others?” but, “What do ye more than others?” Full of deep meaning are His words, “If ye know these things,
          happy are ye if ye do them” (John 13:17). Words are of no value unless they are spoken in sincerity and in
          truth. The talent of words is made effective and of value when they are accompanied by appropriate deeds. It
          is of vital consequence to every soul to hear the Word and be a doer of it.</p>
      <p>“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and
          many there be which go in thereat” (Matthew 7:13)....</p>
      <p>We have evidence that there are many deceivers in the world, men who say, “I go, sir,” but go not. They may
          speak smooth words, and make fair speeches; but they deceive; they reveal in their lives that their words are
          not wrought in God. The practical life is a genuine index of the character. By our words and works we reveal
          to the world, to angels, and to men whether we believe in Christ as a personal Saviour.</p>
      <p>Good works do not purchase the love of God, but they reveal that we possess that love. If we surrender our will
          and way to God, we will not work for God’s love; we will obey the commandments of God because it is right to
          do thus. The disciple John wrote, “We love him, because he ﬁrst loved us” (1 John 4:19). The true spiritual
          life will be revealed in every soul who is doing service for Christ. Those who are alive to Christ are imbued
          with His spirit, and they cannot help working in His vineyard. They work the work of God. Let every soul think
          prayerfully, that he may act <nobr>consistently.—Manuscript</nobr> 120, August 23, 1899„ “Go, Work Today in My
          Vineyard.”</p>
