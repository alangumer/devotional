    <h1>I Will Keep Thee</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
          which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Revelation 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>These words are important and solemn, and it would be proﬁtable to us should we take them home with us, and
          search the Scriptures in reference to their true meaning. The hour of temptation is to come upon all the
          world, to try them that dwell upon the earth; and although we do not wish to make a time of trouble for
          ourselves, nor do we wish to groan over trials in the future, still we should be so closely connected with God
          that we shall not fall under the temptation when it does come. “Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that
          obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of
          the Lord, and stay upon his God” (Isaiah 50:10).</p>
      <p>The Lord will raise up a standard for us against the enemy. We should believe that we have a helper in God,
          that we shall not be afraid, we shall not be ﬁlled with wonder and amazement; for we know that the God of
          Israel has been with His people from the very <nobr>ﬁrst—from</nobr> the very infancy of this world God has
          been with His obedient children. We must show that we have conﬁdence in God, and make it manifest to the world
          that we can trust Him because we believe in Him. His word is pledged that there shall no temptation come upon
          us, but that help shall be provided to sustain us....</p>
      <p>We expect trials to come in these last days; we are not looking for anything else; but may God give us grace
          that we may endure the trials when they do come, and not faint under persecution. We do not desire to be in a
          position where we shall have no strength at that time. Then let us become acquainted with God now....</p>
      <p>God has a people who will not receive the mark of the beast in their right hand or in their forehead. God has a
          place for His people to ﬁll in this world, to reﬂect light. You are God’s sentinels. Christ says of His
          people, “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid” (Matthew 5:14).... God
          made His law for all the universe. He created man, He gives the</p>
      <p>bounteous provisions of nature, holds our breath and life in His hand. He is to be recognized, His law honored,
          before all the great men and the highest earthly <nobr>powers.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 15,
          1890.</p>
