    <h1>Present Advantages and Future Beneﬁts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and ﬁnisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured
          the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews
          12:2.</strong></p>
      <p>We should ever cherish feelings of gratitude to those who have shown us favors in times of need. But these
          feelings that are so readily called into exercise by the kindness and disinterestedness of our friends should
          respond to the love and compassion of our benevolent heavenly Friend.... The friendship expressed</p>
      <p>by nearest and dearest relatives and friends is so far surpassed by the revelation of Jesus Christ that the
          former is dumb and expressionless when compared with the latter. It is natural that the heart should entertain
          sentiments of the warmest affection toward those who have done or suffered something for us.</p>
      <p>Let me lead you to the scene of the cruciﬁxion and show you the Son of God dying in your stead. Will not the
          spectacle of the cross of Christ awaken every feeling of gratitude? Will it not sweep away the coldness and
          indifference which steels the senses to the great sacriﬁce made in our behalf? ...</p>
      <p>Satan, the adversary of souls, is constantly at work with his devices and enchantments, stealing away the
          senses and deadening the feelings to our highest interest. To all the little matters of life the affections
          are given free play, but in eternal interest the affections are trammeled, bound as by magical cords....</p>
      <p>There are so many who endure privation and pursue at considerable sacriﬁce a course which promises advantages
          in the future. They forego present comfort for a future inducement as an equivalent, but here Jesus presents
          eternal life as the reward of obedience, and if paltry things of earthly gain will be sacriﬁced for some
          future good, how much more should ease, pleasure, and present worldly advantages be sacriﬁced for the
          incomparable riches and glory of the future immortal life. Let not the sorcery of earthly enchantments steal
          the affections from God and harden the heart to eternal interest. Look at the things that are unseen. Enshrine
          Jesus in the heart. Love Him with your whole <nobr>soul.—Letter</nobr> 15a, November 15, 1871„ to Edson and
          Emma White. Edson was 22 and Emma was 23.</p>
