      <p><strong>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according
          to his own labour. 1 Corinthians 3:8.</strong></p>
      <p>When Christ called His disciples from their ﬁshing nets, He told them that they were to be ﬁshers of men. By
          this Christ meant that they were to work. In communicating the truth to others, they were to cast their nets
          on the right side of the ship. By this Christ meant that they were to work in faith to save souls. And this
          work for individuals would, in the providence of God, lead them to work for communities. They were not to
          think themselves part of different systems of work, but individual threads of the great whole, inseparably
          united, like links in a chain, connected with their fellow men and with God.</p>
      <p>God desires that the youth shall become skillful, thorough laborers, wearing Christ’s yoke, lifting His
          burdens. “Ye are labourers together with God,” He says. The children and youth should seek most earnestly to
          advance in understanding, in mental acquirements; their aim should be in spiritual as well as temporal things,
          to work upon the plan of addition. “Giving all diligence,” the apostle Peter says, “add to your faith virtue;
          and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
          and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and
          abound, they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
          Christ” (2 Peter <nobr>1:5-8)....</nobr></p>
      <p>Advancement in true education does not harmonize with selﬁshness. True knowledge comes from God, and returns
          again to God. His children are to receive that they may give again. Those who through the grace of God have
          received intellectual and spiritual beneﬁts are, as they advance, to draw others with them to a higher
          excellence. And this work, done to promote the good of others, will have the cooperation of unseen agencies.
          As we faithfully continue the work, we shall have high aspirations for righteousness, holiness, and a perfect
          knowledge of God. We ourselves will become complete in Christ in this life, and will take with us to the
          courts above our increased capabilities, there to continue our higher <nobr>education.—Manuscript</nobr> 108,
          September 1, 1898„ “Higher Education.”</p>
