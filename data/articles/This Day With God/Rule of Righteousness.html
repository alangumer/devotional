    <h1>Rule of Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,</strong></p>
      <p>...make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight,
          through Jesus Christ. Hebrews 13:20, 21.</p>
      <p>When you come together for worship and to seek the Lord, it should be your one aim to honor Him whose
          requirements are all equal and just. His will, declared to you in His word, is to be carried out to the
          letter. The rule of righteousness revealed in the lives of His professing people is to make them conspicuous.
          We are to live with an eye single to the glory of God, ever seeking to be Christians in every sense of the
          word.</p>
      <p>These words were spoken by our Instructor: “You are to be under the control of God. Learn how to harmonize.
          Love as brethren; be pitiful; be courteous. God’s commandments are just and equal. All His workers are to be
          honored as laborers together with God.</p>
      <p>“The varied interests of the work are to be built up with care. From this time onward responsibilities will
          rapidly increase. God’s will, the perfect rule of righteousness, is to be revealed in your work. Commune often
          every day with your God, and listen to the voice that says to you, ‘Be still, and know that I am God’ (Psalm
          46:10). As your responsibilities increase with the advancement of the message, temptations will also increase.
          As the magnitude of the work presses itself upon the soul, humble your hearts before God. Act faithfully your
          part in the work, and stand faithfully in your individual accountability before God. God is no respecter of
          persons. He that doeth righteousness is righteous. A mere profession is of no value, and knowledge is of worth
          only as it is used righteously.</p>
      <p>“Murmur not; repine not; covet not; quarrel not;” our Instructor continued. “When you are afﬂicted, look to the
          great Physician. You have need to rejoice, and to humble yourselves before the Lord. By indulging a selﬁsh
          spirit, men become narrow and shortsighted; and then they fail to read from cause to effect. The Word of the
          Lord is to be your guide in all things. ‘The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before
          him”’ (Habakkuk 2:20)....</p>
      <p>The Lord now calls upon the men chosen for His work to stand as one man for the advancement of the cause of
          <nobr>Christ.—Letter</nobr> 112, March 10, 1907„ to the directors of the Nashville Sanitarium and the Southern
          Union Conference.</p>
