      <p><strong>Among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
          him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of
          God. John 12:42, 43.</strong></p>
      <p>There is much light yet to shine forth from the law of God and the gospel of righteousness. This message,
          understood in its true character, and proclaimed in the Spirit, will lighten the earth with its glory. The
          great decisive question is to be brought before all nations, tongues, and peoples. The closing work of the
          third angel’s message will be attended with a power that will send the rays of the Sun of Righteousness into
          all the highways and byways of life, and decisions will be made for God as supreme Governor; His law will be
          looked upon as the rule of His government.</p>
      <p>Many who claim to believe the truth will change their opinions in times of peril, and will take the side of the
          transgressors of God’s law in order to escape persecution. There will be great humbling of heart before God on
          the part of everyone who remains faithful and true to the end. But Satan will so work upon the unconsecrated
          elements of the human mind that many will not accept the light in God’s appointed way....</p>
      <p>There is positive danger that some who profess to believe the truth will be found in a position similar to that
          of the Jews. They take the ideas of the men they are associated with, not because by searching the Scriptures
          they conscientiously accept the teachings in doctrine as truth. I entreat you to make God your trust; idolize
          no man, depend upon no man. Let not your love of man hold them in places of trust that they are not qualiﬁed
          to ﬁll to the glory of God, for man is ﬁnite and erring, liable to be controlled by his own opinions and
          feelings. <nobr>Self-esteem</nobr> and <nobr>self-righteousness</nobr> are coming in upon us, and many will
          fall because of unbelief and unrighteousness, for the grace of Christ is not ruling in the hearts of many. We
          are to be ever searching for the truth as for hidden treasures....</p>
      <p>I have been shown that Jesus will reveal to us precious old truths in a new light, if we are ready to receive
          them; but they must be received in the very way in which the Lord shall choose to send
          <nobr>them.—Manuscript</nobr> 15, November 1, 1888„ “A Call to a Deeper Study of the Word.”</p>
