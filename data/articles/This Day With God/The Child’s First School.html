      <p><strong>And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. Isaiah
          54:13.</strong></p>
      <p>It is your duty [parents] to do all you possibly can to carry out God’s purpose for your children revealed in
          His Word. When the Lord sees that you are in earnest in striving to save their souls, He will give you grace
          and power to enable you to accomplish this work.</p>
      <p>God has given His people great light on His Word. But this light is a beneﬁt to the believer only as he
          practices the truth, purifying his soul by obedience. Is Satan always to triumph because parents misrepresent
          God by following worldly plans, failing to show the power of Christ to cleanse the heart? The whole church
          suffers when the children of one family are unruly. Christ is soon to come. Our schools are to reach the high
          standard of dependence on Bible principles.</p>
      <p>Parents need a much deeper sense of what it means to be Christlike. They need to see the importance of laboring
          for the salvation of their children. God demands from them much greater consecration than they have ever shown
          before. Unless they reform in many ways, the school will not accomplish what it should.</p>
      <p>The home is the child’s ﬁrst school. God will hold those parents accountable who do not discipline their
          children in accordance with His instruction. Parents are to seek God earnestly and obey Him implicitly, and
          they are to require obedience from their children. Do not think that you can neglect your children, and then
          secure their future safety by sending them to [church] school and Sabbath school. God calls upon you to do
          your neglected work. In the home, practice temperance in all things. And sustain the teachers who are trying
          to give your children a true education....</p>
      <p>The light which shines from the cross of Calvary shows the work which God requires to be earnestly and
          vigilantly done as long as time shall <nobr>last.—Letter</nobr> 134, October 11, 1901„ to the teachers and
          students of the Healdsburg School.</p>
