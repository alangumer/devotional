      <p><strong>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
          Daniel 8:14.</strong></p>
      <p>In the future, great watchfulness will be needed. There is to be among God’s people no spiritual stupidity.
          Evil spirits are actively engaged in seeking to control the minds of human beings. Men are binding up in
          bundles, ready to be consumed by the ﬁres of the last days. Those who discard Christ and His righteousness
          will accept the sophistry that is ﬂooding the world. Christians are to be sober and vigilant, steadfastly
          resisting their adversary the devil, who is going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</p>
      <p>Men under the inﬂuence of evil spirits will work miracles. They will make people sick by casting their spell
          upon them, and then remove the spell, leading others to say that those who were sick have been miraculously
          healed. This Satan has done again and again.</p>
      <p>God will be the sanctuary of His people, if they will obey His word, believing and proclaiming the simple
          gospel truths that Christ proclaimed when in this world. We need now to pray as we have never prayed before.
          We are living in the great day of atonement, and we are to confess our sins, and make diligent work for
          repentance. We are to put all our capabilities to work, that we may be delivered from wicked and unreasonable
          men. Satan comes down as a beautiful angel, and presents lovely pictures before the eyes of those who have so
          perverted their ways before God that they do not see what they are or know what they need. The enemy has come
          down with great power, to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. God calls for
          repentance and reconversion....</p>
      <p>When the lives of God’s people are cleansed from moral and spiritual pollution; when their eyes are anointed
          with the heavenly eyesalve, they will see that they are poor, and wretched, and miserable, and blind, and
          naked. They will come to the fountain that has been opened for Judah and Jerusalem, and apply the cleansing
          blood of Christ to their poor, <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> souls. God grant that they make no delay in securing the
          advantages that He has prepared for all who love Him and keep His <nobr>commandments.—Letter</nobr> 259,
          November 23, 1903„ to Mrs. L. M. Hall, a close friend and for many years matron of the Battle Creek
          Sanitarium.</p>
