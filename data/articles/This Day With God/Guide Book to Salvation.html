    <h1>Guide Book to Salvation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou
          hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise
          unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 2 Timothy 3:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>The many human inventions to explain the Word, making students understand it through the assertions of learned
          men, is a mistake. God has not made the reception of the gospel to depend upon reasonings. The gospel is
          adapted for spiritual food, to satisfy man’s spiritual appetite. In every case it is just what man
          needs....</p>
      <p>The Word of God is the great educating book. But while many claim to respect it, they place other books before
          it. The human reason is exalted above the divine. Must I speak out plainly, and bear a decided testimony? Had
          the Word of God been regarded as it ever should have <nobr>been—as</nobr> the voice of God to men, the source
          of all wisdom, all truth, all higher <nobr>education—children,</nobr> youth, and parents would have made it
          not only their study, but their teacher and their guide, that “in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding
          riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:7)....</p>
      <p>“In the ages to come.” What a history those ages will unfold. How can the children of the world endure to look
          into the heights and depths of that eternity called by the apostle “the ages to come”? What can be known about
          those “ages to come”?</p>
      <p>The Bible is the textbook, and it is to be searched <nobr>diligently—not</nobr> as we would read a book among
          many books. It must be to us the book that meets the wants of the soul. This book will make the man who
          studies and obeys it wise unto salvation. As food cannot nourish the body unless it be eaten and digested,
          neither can the Word of the living God proﬁt the soul unless it be received as the teacher in higher
          educational lines, as above all human productions; unless its principles be obeyed because it is the wisdom of
          God....</p>
      <p>God will work out His own purpose, taking the human agent into copartnership with the great ﬁrm of salvation,
          and making of him all that He has promised in accordance with His Word: “I will make a man more precious than
          ﬁne gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir” (Isaiah <nobr>13:12).—Manuscript</nobr> 50, April 28,
          1898„ “The Jews Require a Sign.”</p>
