    <h1>What to Do With Depression</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God. Psalm
          43:5.</strong></p>
      <p>In the night season I was conversing with you. I was saying to you, ...“Do not give way to depression, but let
          the comforting inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit be welcomed into your heart, to give you comfort and peace.”</p>
      <p>I am praying that the Lord will reveal Himself to you as a personal Comforter. The eyes of the soul must be
          kept open, in order to recognize the great mercies of our heavenly Father. Jesus is a bright and shining
          light. Let Him reﬂect His bright beams into the heart and mind. Do not forget thanksgiving. “Whoso offereth
          praise gloriﬁeth me” (Psalm 50:23). Look to Him, and lay before Him all your necessities. Is anything too hard
          for the Lord? He is the Great Physician. He can heal soul and body, and He would have you take hold of Him in
          faith. He fully understands the needs of your case. He is a very present help in every time of need. And He is
          pleased when we show our gratitude to Him.</p>
      <p>Christ is the light of the world. “Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing
          in his wings” (Malachi 4:2). Let the light of His peace shine into your soul. He has a tender care for you,
          and you should praise Him with heart and soul and voice. You can please Him by manifesting a cheerful spirit.
          Let not one cloud of despondency or dissatisfaction hide from you the sunshine of His presence.</p>
      <p>It is in recognizing His light that you will conquer. You may increase in faith, by exercising the voice in
          speaking forth the praises of God. To the heart that recognizes Him is the promise, “I am ...the bright and
          morning star” (Revelation 22:16).</p>
      <p>If you would obtain precious victories, face the light that emanates from the Sun of Righteousness. Talk hope
          and faith and thanksgiving to God. Be cheerful, hopeful in Christ. Educate yourself to praise Him. This is a
          great remedy for diseases of the soul and of the body. “I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my
          countenance, and my God” (Psalm 42:11; <nobr>43:5).—Letter</nobr> 322, October 23, 1906„ to the wife of a
          church leader in Australia.</p>
