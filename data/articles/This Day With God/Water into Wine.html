      <p><strong>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory. John
          2:11.</strong></p>
      <p>During the wedding feast at Cana of Galilee, at which Christ was present, it was discovered that from some
          cause the supply of wine had failed. This caused much perplexity and regret. It was unusual to dispense with
          wine on festive occasions, and its absence would seem to indicate a want of hospitality. As a relative of the
          parties, Mary had assisted in the arrangements for the feast, and she now spoke to Jesus, saying, “They have
          no wine” (John 2:3). These words were a suggestion that He might supply their need. But Jesus answered,
          “Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come” (Verse 4).</p>
      <p>The response of Christ did not discourage His mother. At the right moment He would act His part. “His mother
          saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were set there six waterpots of stone,
          after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three ﬁrkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them,
          Fill the waterpots with water. And they ﬁlled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and
          bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it” (Verses <nobr>5-8).</nobr></p>
      <p>When the time had fully come, the miracle wrought by Christ was recognized. As soon as the ruler of the feast
          put the goblet to his lips and tasted the wine, he looked up with glad surprise. The wine was superior to any
          he had ever before drunk. And it was unfermented wine. He said to the bridegroom, “Every man at the beginning
          doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good
          wine until now” (Verse 10).</p>
      <p>Christ did not approach the jars, or touch the water; He simply looked upon the water, and it became the pure
          juice of the grape, clariﬁed and reﬁned. What effect did this miracle <nobr>have?—“His</nobr> disciples
          believed on him” (Verse 11).... By</p>
      <p>this miracle Christ also gave evidence of His mercy and compassion. He showed that He had regard for the
          necessities of those who followed Him to hear His words of knowledge and <nobr>wisdom.—Manuscript</nobr> 79,
          December 23, 1900„ diary.</p>
