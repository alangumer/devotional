    <h1>Talents Are for Use</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whatever gift each of you may have received, use it in service to one another, like good stewards
          dispensing the grace of God in its varied forms. 1 Peter 4:10, N.E.B.</strong></p>
      <p>How many of God’s gifts have been misused, because those to whom they were given did not have the fervor of the
          love of Christ in the soul. There is great need of each one doing his best. There are those who would have
          used wisely the talents given them, if they had been left to struggle and depend on their capabilities. But
          they became the possessors of means, and they lost the incentive to cultivate their talents, and make all
          possible of themselves by communicating what they had. An abundance of money has spoiled them for faithfully
          fulﬁlling their stewardship.</p>
      <p>Let all who claim to be Christians deal wisely with the Lord’s goods. God is making an inventory of the money
          lent you and the spiritual advantages given you. Will you as stewards make careful inventory? Will you examine
          whether you are using economically all that God has placed in your charge, or whether you are wasting the
          Lord’s goods by selﬁsh outlay in order to make a display? Would that all that is spent needlessly, were laid
          up as treasure in heaven.</p>
      <p>God gives more than money to His stewards. Your talent of imparting is a gift. What are you communicating of
          the gifts of God in your words, in your tender sympathy? Are you allowing your money to go into the enemy’s
          ranks to ruin the ones you seek to please? Then again, the knowledge of the truth is a talent. There are many
          souls in darkness that might be enlightened by true, faithful words from you. There are hearts that are
          hungering for sympathy, perishing away from God. Your sympathy may help them....</p>
      <p>The ﬁrst work for all Christians to do is to search the Scriptures with most earnest prayer, that they may have
          that faith that works by love, and puriﬁes the soul from every thread of selﬁshness. If the truth is received
          into the heart, it works like good leaven, until every power is brought into subjection to the will of God.
          Then you can no more help shining, than the sun can help <nobr>shining.—Manuscript</nobr> 42, March 17, 1898„
