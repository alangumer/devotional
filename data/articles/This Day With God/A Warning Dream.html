    <h1>A Warning Dream</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken!
          Habakkuk 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>I dreamed I was wondering why you, [this brother owned a pleasure boat on the west coast.] were so much away
          from your home and your family, and from the house of God on the Sabbath, and absent from the prayer meeting.
          In a moment I was on board your boat. There was a jovial class of men, talking and laughing, joking and
          <nobr>card-playing.</nobr> You were one with them. I saw the tables prepared with a quality of food to meet
          the vitiated appetite of the company. I heard them call for liquor.</p>
      <p>I looked up in astonishment to hear your voice,_____ _____, a professed disciple of Christ, professedly looking
          for and hasting unto His appearing, say, “Here, gentlemen.” Wine of different kinds was placed before them,
          and they partook of it, and you drank with them....</p>
      <p>The young man who has so many times explained to me my dreams, spoke to you and said, “Eating and drinking with
          the drunkard.... Who bought those</p>
      <p>bottles of drink?” Said you, “I bought them, for I could not get companions to sail with me unless I pleased
          their appetites in this respect.”</p>
      <p>This is sufﬁcient evidence that you are not pleasing God, and that you are placing yourself on Satan’s ﬁeld of
          temptation. You are making a fearful sacriﬁce to gratify your inordinate love of being on the water. If this
          is your choice before doing the work which God would have you do, you will not long be allowed to pursue your
          course. You will lose both worlds....</p>
      <p>I have, since this dream, had another. I dreamed you were again using tobacco. I thought that these miserable
          habits, once overcome, were being taken up by you and that you were going back, step by step, to darkness,
          selling your soul at a cheap market. But I will now ask you, _____ _____, what do you propose to do? You stand
          in imminent peril....</p>
      <p>I warn you, as a mother would her son, to avoid those things which will endanger your morals, involve you in
          disgrace through the cultivation of perverted appetite.... I commit these few pages to you as an
          ambassador</p>
      <p>of Christ. Beware lest you turn from the warning given. In love, Ellen G. <nobr>White.—Letter</nobr> 5, May 9,
          1877,.</p>
