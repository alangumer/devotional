    <h1>Trust and Obey</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh ﬂesh his arm.... Blessed is the
          man that trusteth in the Lord, and</strong></p>
      <p>whose hope the Lord is. Jeremiah <nobr>17:5-7.</nobr></p>
      <p>Like the Jews in the days of Christ, many today hear and believe, but are not willing to step out upon the
          platform of obedience, and accept the truth as it is in Jesus. They are afraid of losing worldly advantages.
          Their minds assent to the truth but to obey means to lift the cross of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and sacriﬁce,
          and to cease trusting in man and making ﬂesh their arm, and they turn away from the cross. They might sit at
          the feet of Jesus, learning daily of Him whom to know aright is life eternal, but they are not willing.</p>
      <p>Every one who is saved must surrender his own plans, his ambitious schemes, which mean
          <nobr>self-gloriﬁcation,</nobr> and follow where Christ leads the way. The understanding must be yielded up to
          Christ, for Him to cleanse, and reﬁne, and purify. This will always be done when a right reception is given to
          the teachings of the Lord Jesus. It is hard for self to die daily, even when the wondrous story of God’s grace
          is presented with the wealth of His love, which He unfolds to the soul’s necessity.</p>
      <p>O how much we need a more intimate acquaintance with the Lord Jesus. We need to enter into His will and carry
          out His purposes, saying with the whole heart, “Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?” O how I long to see our
          churches in a condition different from the condition in which they now <nobr>are—grieving</nobr> the Holy
          Spirit day by day with their lukewarm religious life, a life neither cold nor hot. Christ says, “I would thou
          wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my
          mouth” (Revelation 3:15, 16).</p>
      <p>O how greatly Christ would be honored and gloriﬁed before irreligious, worldly men and women if His followers
          were what they claim to <nobr>be—true</nobr> Christians, the love of Christ constraining them to make Him
          known before an idolatrous world, showing the marked contrast between those who serve God and those who serve
          Him not....We are to tell others of the love of Christ, and</p>
      <p>in order to do this, we must know by experience what it means to have this love in the heart. All will ﬁnd
          abundant opportunities to work if they will improve the opportunities that come to <nobr>them.—Letter</nobr>
          35, February 25, 1903„ to Sister L. M. Hall, a faithful <nobr>co-worker</nobr> and for many years matron of
          the Battle Creek Sanitarium.</p>
