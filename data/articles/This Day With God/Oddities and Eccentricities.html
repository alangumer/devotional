      <p><strong>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the
          Spirit and of power. 1 Corinthians 2:4.</strong></p>
      <p>We are not surprised to ﬁnd that Satan will work today as he has worked in the past. We must live by faith; for
          without faith it is impossible to please God....</p>
      <p>Boasting claims of righteousness and noisy demonstrations are calculated to lead to a fanatical experience that
          will confuse many minds. If such things are encouraged, a wave of fanaticism will come into our ranks that
          will be detrimental to the work of God, and that will sweep away many souls in a dangerous delusion. These
          things are designed by Satan to deceive, if possible, the very elect.</p>
      <p>It is our privilege to preach the Word in the demonstration of the Spirit. It is the privilege of every soul to
          exercise faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. But pure spiritual life comes only as the soul surrenders itself to
          the will of God through Christ, the reconciling Saviour. It is our privilege to be worked by the Holy Spirit.
          Through the exercise of faith we are brought into communion with Christ Jesus, for Christ dwells in the hearts
          of all who are meek and lowly. Theirs is a faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul, a faith that brings
          peace to the heart, and leads in the path of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce....</nobr></p>
      <p>Let there be no oddities or eccentricities of movement on the part of those who speak the Word of truth, for
          such things will weaken the impression that should be made by the Word. We must be guarded, for Satan is
          determined, if possible, to intermingle with religious services his evil inﬂuence. Let there be no theatrical
          display, for this will not help to strengthen belief in the Word of God. Rather it will divert attention to
          the human instrument....</p>
      <p>Those who are really under the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit, will reveal its power by a practical application of
          the eternal principles of truth. They will reveal that the holy oil is emptied from the two olive branches
          into the chambers of the soul temple. Their words will be imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit to soften
          and subdue the heart. It will be manifest that the words spoken are spirit and <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 352,
          December 16, 1908„ to Elder S. N. Haskell, president of the California Conference.</p>
