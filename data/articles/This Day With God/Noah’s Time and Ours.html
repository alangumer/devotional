    <h1>Noah’s Time and Ours</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the
          saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by
          faith. Hebrews 11:7.</strong></p>
      <p>It was through Noah’s consistent faith and works combined that condemned the world. He not only preached the
          present truth appropriate for that time, but he acted every sermon. Had he never lifted his voice in warning,
          his works, his holy character among the corrupt and ungodly would have been condemning sermons to the
          unbelieving and dissolute of that age. He bore himself with a Christlike patience and meekness under the
          provoking insults, taunts, and mockery. His voice was often heard in prayer to God for His power and help that
          he might do all the commandments of God. This was a condemning power to the unbelieving.</p>
      <p>But the time comes when the last appeal of Noah is made to the guilty race. He bids them yet once again heed
          the message of warning and ﬁnd refuge in the ark. He stretches out his hands in supplication with voice full
          of sympathy. With quivering lip and tearful eye, he tells them his work is done, but the loud, coarse mocking
          and scoffs and insults more determined are heaped upon Noah. Enthusiast, fanatic, crazy, falls upon his ear.
          He bids them all farewell, he and his family enter the ark, and God shut the door. That door that shut Noah
          in, shut out the world. It was a shut door in Noah’s time. And the Lord shut him in. Up to that time, God had
          opened a door whereby the inhabitants of the old world might ﬁnd refuge if they believed the message sent to
          them from God. But that door was now shut and no man could open it. Probation was ended.</p>
      <p>The long forbearance of God had ceased, the ﬁgures in the books of God’s reckoning had been accumulating, the
          cup of the unjust was full. Mercy then ceased and justice took the sword of vengeance....</p>
      <p>There was a shut door in Noah’s time. There was a shut door to the unbelievers in the destruction of Sodom, but
          an open door to Lot. There was a shut door to the inhabitants of Tyrus, a shut door to the inhabitants of
          Jerusalem</p>
      <p>...who disbelieved, but an open door to the humble, the believing, those who obeyed God. Thus it will be at the
          end of <nobr>time.—Manuscript</nobr> 17, August 14, 1885„ “Shipboard Meditations.”</p>
