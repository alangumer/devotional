    <h1>Heavenly Guarantee</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Matthew
          7:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Oh, if every one would only know by personal experience how much of heaven’s promised rest can be secured to
          the soul, even now, by sincere prayer. If one has not learned this lesson, every other lesson of life [had]
          better not be learned till he shall learn in the school of Christ how to master this lesson.</p>
      <p>As Christians we want a new and living experience every day. We want to learn how to trust Jesus, to believe in
          Him and conﬁde everything to Him. Jacob was raised from a man of feebleness and defects, through faith in God
          in prayer, to be a prince with God. He prevailed through faith. God is omnipotent. Man is ﬁnite. In converse
          with God, we may lay the most secret thing of the soul open to <nobr>Him—for</nobr> He knows it
          <nobr>all—but</nobr> not to man....</p>
      <p>Do not become careless and separate from the Source of your strength. Watch your thoughts, watch your words,
          and in all things you seek to do, seek to glorify God. The more closely you lie at the foot of the cross, the
          more clearly will you see the matchless charms of Jesus and the unparalleled love He has evidenced for fallen
          man....</p>
      <p>Let not the pressure of business separate you from God, for if you ever need counsel and clear forethought and
          sharp ideas, it is when you have much work on your hands. It is then that you need to take time to pray, to
          have increased faith and implicit trust in the counsel of the Physician in Chief. Ask Him to help you. Pray
          the oftener the more critical the work you have to do....</p>
      <p>Oh what a theme to contemplate that man, depraved and lost in his natural condition, may be renewed and saved
          by the gracious help that Christ gives him in the gospel. The love of Jesus in the soul will drive out the
          enemy who is seeking to take possession of man. Every trial patiently borne, every blessing thankfully
          received, every temptation faithfully resisted, will make you a strong man in Jesus Christ. All this grace may
          be gained in the prayer of faith....</p>
      <p>Lay hold upon strength from above. Even Jesus, when preparing for some great trial, would resort to the
          solitude of the mountains and spend the night in prayer to His <nobr>Father.—Letter</nobr> 11, April 5, 1886„
          to Dr. Gibbs, a physician at the St. Helena Sanitarium.</p>
