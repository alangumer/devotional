      <p><strong>Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore
          the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. Luke 10:2.</strong></p>
      <p>I had been unable to ride for some time, owing to hip and spine difﬁculties, and during the drive home [from
          Healdsburg College] I became very weary. But I am so grateful to my heavenly Father that He strengthens
          me.</p>
      <p>Recently, open air meetings have been held by our brethren at Calistoga [California].... The next one will be
          held near St. Helena, if a suitable place can</p>
      <p>be found. We desire to do all we can to warn those around us of the soon coming of the Saviour. I believe much
          good will be accomplished as we take up this work. My heart is drawn out for those in darkness, who know not
          the truth....</p>
      <p>I hope soon to visit the soldiers’ home at Yountville. For several months a company of workers have been going
          there every other Sabbath to hold a song service. At ﬁrst only a few attended the services, but now there are
          from <nobr>seventy-ﬁve</nobr> to one hundred present every time. Sometimes a <nobr>thirty-minute</nobr> talk
          on some Bible subject is given. At a meeting held a few weeks ago, the soldiers were asked if they would like
          to have a short Bible study after the song service. About a dozen said they would. But when the time came for
          the reading to be held, over ﬁfty were present. The workers take reading matter with them, and when the
          soldiers are asked whether they would like it, their faces light up, and their hands are eagerly stretched out
          to receive the books and papers.</p>
      <p>Last Sabbath one <nobr>intelligent-looking</nobr> man in the home said to one of our brethren, “Before you came
          here to sing for us, I spent nearly all my time in drinking and carousing with my companions. But since you
          have been coming here, I have found a much better way to employ my time. I have given up liquor drinking and
          am spending my spare time in reading the Desire of Ages....</p>
      <p>We hope that the work for the soldiers will go forward. Several are interested, and those in charge of the home
          recognize the good work that is being done. I fully believe that some of these old men, perhaps many, will be
          saved. I wish that all our people could see the many doors that are open before <nobr>them.—Letter</nobr> 112,
          June 21, 1903„ to Elder and Mrs. J. A. Burden, while laboring in Australia.</p>
