    <h1>God Will Work With You</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the
          way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. Genesis 18:19.</strong></p>
      <p>I would write words to console and comfort you. The Lord has not left you, His everlasting arms are beneath
          you. He has given you an experience in Christian life that is of the highest value. You have let your light
          shine in your family, and its divine rays are felt. Yet there is a danger that you will allow your affection
          for your children to lead you to grant requests that your judgment tells you are neither for their best good
          nor for the glory of God.</p>
      <p>You have been the Lord’s chosen instrument, through whom He has worked, and will work for the saving of the
          souls of your children. You are to bear the testimony that John bore, repeating the words of Christ to love
          one another as Christ has loved them. The Holy Spirit will testify of their union with Christ, and believers
          and unbelievers will take knowledge of you that you have been with Christ and have learned of Him. As you
          follow on to know the Lord, you will reﬂect the character of Christ.</p>
      <p>You will be subject to the inﬁrmities of humanity, and will no doubt make mistakes, but the compassionate,
          loving Saviour will pardon all your errors, because you ask Him, and because you love Jesus. In spirit you
          will breathe the meekness of Christ, and will be a light in your home. Your conversation will be seasoned with
          grace, and a holy unction will pervade your prayers. The Lord will work with your efforts as He has in the
          past, and His righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rereward.</p>
      <p>You have every reason for praising God for His loving kindness and tender mercy. His <nobr>all-atoning</nobr>
          blood is available to all your children. If you do not overtax your physical powers, you can in the name of
          Jesus do much precious work To you therefore which believe, He is precious.... Walk in love as dear</p>
      <p>children. The Spirit of God is striving with the children, inviting them to Christ, saying, “Come; for all
          things are now ready” (Luke 14:17). Will you not <nobr>obey?—Letter</nobr> 94, January 31, 1895„ to the
          widowed mother of a large family of adult children.</p>
