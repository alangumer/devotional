    <h1>Into All the World</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of
          the Lord, to be his servants, ...even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house
          of prayer. Isaiah 56:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>The glad tidings of salvation are to be taken to those who have not yet heard them. Satan is determined to
          place God’s people in a false light before the world. He is pleased when their lives reveal defects, when they
          cherish objectionable traits of character. These traits of character he uses in his service. He tries to keep
          God’s people in a continual state of uncertainty by bringing in false theories and false science. He seeks to
          deceive them as he deceived Adam and Eve. He would lead them to depart from God, their true Counselor, and
          accept his spiritualistic sophistries. With these sophistries clothed in the garments of light, he seeks to
          deceive if possible the very elect.</p>
      <p>Many yield to his temptations, and the time and inﬂuence of God’s servants, which should be used in making
          known to unbelievers the truth for this time, is used in efforts to recover professing believers from Satan’s
          snares. Thus the way of the advancement of the truth is blocked. It is no easy matter to clear the King’s
          highway while men trust in themselves, and make ﬂesh their arm....</p>
      <p>To all who will do justice and judgment, keeping their hand from doing any evil, the promise is, “Even unto
          them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I
          will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off” (Isaiah 56:5).</p>
      <p>Among the people of God there is to be no colonizing. The word of the Lord to them is, “Thou shalt break forth
          on the right hand and on the left” (chap. 54:3). They are to make plants in all places. Everywhere the truth
          for this time is to be proclaimed. Those into whose hearts the light has shone are to remember that they are
          God’s workmen, His witnesses. To serve and honor Him is to be their science. They are to call upon others to
          keep His commandments, and live. Obedience to the law of God is the question that is to test the
          world....</p>
      <p>To all peoples and nations and kindreds and tongues the truth is to be proclaimed. The time has come for much
          aggressive work to be done in the cities and in all neglected, unworked <nobr>ﬁelds.—Letter</nobr> 263,
          November 12, 1903„ to physicians and nurses.</p>
