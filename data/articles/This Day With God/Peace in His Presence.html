    <h1>Peace in His Presence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. I will meditate also
          of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. Psalm 77:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>Great things are before us, and we want to call the people from their indifference, to get ready for that
          day.... We are not now to cast away our</p>
      <p>conﬁdence, but to have ﬁrm assurance, ﬁrmer than ever before. Hitherto hath the Lord helped us, and He will
          help us to the end. We will look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what the Lord hath done for us, to
          comfort and to save us from the hand of the destroyer. We want to have fresh in our memory every tear the Lord
          has wiped from our eyes, every pain He has soothed, every anxiety removed, every fear dispelled, every want
          supplied, every mercy bestowed, and strengthen ourselves for all that is before us through the remainder of
          our pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>We can but look onward to new perplexities in the coming conﬂict, but we may well look on what is past as well
          as what is to come, and say, “Hitherto hath the Lord helped us” (1 Samuel 7:12). “As thy days, so shall thy
          strength be” (Deuteronomy 33:25). The trial will not exceed the strength which shall be given us to bear
          it.</p>
      <p>Then let us take up our work just where we ﬁnd it, without one word of repining, imagining nothing can come but
          that strength will come proportionate to the trial. Our children are in the hands of God. Our faith must
          awaken to grasp the promises and we not repine, we not be mournful, for then we dishonor God. We must
          encourage a cheerful, hopeful frame of mind. Our present peace must not be disturbed by anticipated trials,
          for God will never leave nor forsake one soul who trusts in Him. God is better unto us than our fears. If we
          would encourage a diligent remembrance and recital of our mercies, counting up instances in which God has
          wrought for us, has been better to us than our fears, in which He has interposed His power and His grace when
          sorely perplexed, sustained us when falling, comforted us when sorrowing, we would see that it is unbelief to
          distrust God or be ﬁlled with anxiety. Let mercies be remembered and enjoyed daily. We must live by faith
          daily.... Rejoice in God always. Today</p>
      <p>praise God for His grace, and continue to praise Him every <nobr>day.—Letter</nobr> 11a, February 19, 1884„ to
          Elder and Mrs. Uriah Smith.</p>
