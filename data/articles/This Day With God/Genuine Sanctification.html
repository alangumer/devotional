    <h1>Genuine Sanctiﬁcation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
          daily, and follow me. Luke 9:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Monday morning meeting commenced half past ﬁve under the tent. I spoke about thirty minutes upon the necessity
          of economy in dress and in the expenditure of means. There is danger of becoming reckless and careless of the
          Lord’s money. Young ministers who engage in tent labor should be careful and not run up high expenses. The
          wants of the cause are many, as tents are entering new ﬁelds and as the missionary work is enlarging. The most
          rigid economy should be used in this matter without stinginess....</p>
      <p>Our morning meeting was held in the tent. I spoke again about thirty minutes in reference to genuine
          sanctiﬁcation which is nothing less than a daily dying to self and daily conformity to the will of God. Paul’s
          sanctiﬁcation was a daily conﬂict with self. Said he, “I die daily” (1 Corinthians 15:31). His will and his
          desires daily conﬂicted with duty and the will of God. In the plan of not following inclination, he did the
          will of God, however unpleasant and crucifying to his nature. The reason many in this age of the world make no
          greater advancement in the divine life is because they interpret their own will to be just what God wills.
          They do exactly as they desire and ﬂatter themselves they are conforming to God’s will. They please self in
          everything and have no conﬂict with self.</p>
      <p>Many battle well at ﬁrst against selﬁsh desires for pleasure and ease. They are sincere and earnest, but grow
          weary of protracted effort of daily death, ceaseless turmoil with resisting Satan’s temptations, and indolence
          seems inviting, death too <nobr>self-repulsive,</nobr> and they close the drowsy eyes and drop under
          temptation instead of resisting it. Fashionable sins, pride of life, do not seem so very repulsive.</p>
      <p>There are no compromises in the Word of God for those who conform to the world. The Son of God has manifested
          that He might draw all men unto Him, but He came not to lull the world to sleep, not to send peace, but a
          sword. The followers of Christ must walk in the light of His glorious example, and at whatever sacriﬁce of
          ease or selﬁsh indulgence, at whatever cost of labor or sufferings, we must maintain the constant battle with
          self and exalt the gospel <nobr>standard.—Letter</nobr> 49a, August 30, 1878.</p>
