    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God,
          and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your
          spirit, which are God’s. 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>The ﬁrst messengers of the gospel were sent forth with the word, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matthew
          10:7). This is our message today. We are to remember that the work of reaching souls cannot be conﬁned to any
          one method. Gospel medical missionary work is to be carried forward, not in the precision of one man’s lines,
          but in Christ’s lines. All that is done is to bear the impress of the Holy Spirit. We are to work as Christ
          worked, in the same practical lines. Then we shall be safe.</p>
      <p>The divine commission needs no reform. Christ’s way of presenting truth cannot be improved upon. The worker who
          tries to bring in methods that will attract the <nobr>worldly-minded,</nobr> supposing that this will remove
          the objections that they feel to taking up the cross, lessens his inﬂuence. Preserve the simplicity of
          godliness. The Lord’s blessing rests not upon the minister whose speech bears the stamp of worldliness. But He
          blesses the words of the one who cherishes the simplicity of true righteousness.</p>
      <p>Our work is to be practical. We are to remember that man has a body as well as a soul to save. Our work
          includes far more than standing before the people to preach to them. In our work we are to minister to the
          physical inﬁrmities of those with whom we are brought in contact. We are to present the principles of health
          reform, impressing our hearers with the thought that they have a part to act in keeping themselves in
          health.</p>
      <p>The body must be kept in a healthy condition in order that the soul may be in health. The condition of the body
          affects the condition of the soul. He who would have physical and spiritual strength must educate his appetite
          in right lines. He must be careful not to burden the soul by overtaxing his physical or spiritual powers.
          Faithful adherence to right principles in eating, drinking, and dressing is a duty that God has laid upon
          human beings.</p>
      <p>The Lord desires us to obey the laws of health and life. He holds each one responsible to care properly for his
          body, that it may be kept in <nobr>health.—Letter</nobr> 123, June 25, 1903„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
