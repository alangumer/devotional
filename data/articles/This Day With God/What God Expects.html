    <h1>How to Make an Impact</h1>

      <p><strong>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant
          men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. Acts 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>When Christ was upon this earth, He did not direct ﬁshermen to leave their nets and boats, and go to the Jewish
          teachers to gain a preparation for the gospel ministry. Walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw “two brethren,
          Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were ﬁshers. And he saith
          unto them, Follow me, and I will make you ﬁshers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed
          him. And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a
          ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. And they immediately left the ship and
          their father, and followed him” (Matthew <nobr>4:18-22).</nobr></p>
      <p>This prompt obedience, without any question, without one promise of wages, seems remarkable. But the words of
          Christ were an invitation that implied all that He meant it should. There was an impelling inﬂuence in His
          words. There was no long explanation, but what He said had a drawing power....</p>
      <p>Christ would make these humble ﬁshermen, in connection with Himself, the means of taking men out of the service
          of Satan, and making them believers in Christ, teaching them in regard to the kingdom of God. In this work
          they would become His ministers, ﬁshers of men....</p>
      <p>Christ chose the foolish things of the <nobr>world—those</nobr> whom the world pronounced unlearned and
          <nobr>ignorant—to</nobr> confound the wise men of the world. The disciples were unlearned in the traditions of
          the rabbis, but with Christ as their example and teacher, they were gaining an education of the highest order;
          for they had before them a divine Example. Christ was presenting to them truths of the highest character.</p>
      <p>Those whom God employs to do service for Him, He would have ﬁtted in His way for that service. Those who preach
          Christ must learn of Christ daily, in order to understand the mystery of saving and serving the souls for whom
          He has died.... They must pattern after Him in all things, sharing His tender compassion</p>
      <p>and His sternness against all evil <nobr>working.—Letter</nobr> 53, February 2, 1905„ to two leading workers at
          the newly established Paradise Valley Sanitarium.</p>
