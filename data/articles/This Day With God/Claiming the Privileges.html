    <h1>Claiming the Privileges</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
          destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
          leadeth unto life, and few there be that ﬁnd it. Matthew 7:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>Do whatever you can and the way will open before you. Every moment of time is golden. Souls out of Christ are
          to be persuaded to lay hold of the hope of the gospel....</p>
      <p>We are not to live in this world to please ourselves. We have stern, earnest work to do every day of our lives.
          We look by faith to the things that are unseen and in so doing we lose sight of the trials and hardships of
          the way. Heaven is our home. We dare not run any risk of losing the one hope we have cherished so long, of
          seeing Jesus as He is and of being made like Him. We hope you will guard your steps. Live the life of prayer
          and faith and win the unfading crown of glory.</p>
      <p>There is no other way for any of us to be saved but that way wrought out by our Redeemer. He has, in His life
          on the earth, given us a practical illustration in <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> of
          what He wishes us to be. “I came not,” says Christ, “to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me”
          (see John 6:38).</p>
      <p>We cannot be Christians while we live to please ourselves. We must enter in through the strait gate of
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> if we follow the Master. This strait, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> path is too narrow
          for many to walk in who profess godliness. They want an easier path and are climbing up some other way. They
          refuse to follow in the footsteps of our Redeemer. Christ calls all such thieves and robbers. They take the
          name of Christian, which does not belong to them, because they do not represent in their life the life of
          Christ. They claim the privileges which belong to the sons of God while they are none of His. They live selﬁsh
          lives upon the earth and have done nothing for the truth and the salvation of souls as they ought to have
          done. Sad indeed for these <nobr>self-deceived</nobr> ones. They will never see heaven, because they are not
          willing to share the shame, the reproach, that Jesus suffered for them.</p>
      <p>Dear children, let Christ be enshrined in your hearts and you will love all for whom Christ has died, and will
          do all you can to save <nobr>them.—Letter</nobr> 30, May 26, 1874„ to her children.</p>
