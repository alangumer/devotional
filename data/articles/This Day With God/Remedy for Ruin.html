    <h1>Remedy for Ruin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
          cruciﬁed unto me, and I unto the world. Galatians 6:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Look at the cross of Calvary. It is a standing pledge of the boundless love, the measureless mercy, of the
          heavenly Father. O that all might repent and do their ﬁrst works. When the churches do this, they will love
          God supremely and their neighbors as themselves. Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not vex Ephraim.
          Divisions will then be healed, the harsh sounds of strife will no more be heard in the borders of Israel.
          Through the grace freely given them of God, all will seek to answer the prayer of Christ, that His disciples
          should be one, even as He and the Father are one. Peace, love, mercy, and benevolence will be the abiding
          principles of the soul. The love of Christ will be the theme of every tongue, and it will no more be said by
          the true Witness, “I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy ﬁrst love” (Revelation 2:4). The
          people of God will be abiding in Christ, the love of Jesus will be revealed, and one Spirit will animate all
          hearts, regenerating and renewing all in the image of Christ, fashioning all hearts alike. As living branches
          of the true Vine, all will be united to Christ, the living head. Christ will abide in every heart, guiding,
          comforting, sanctifying, and presenting to the world the unity of the followers of Jesus, thus bearing
          testimony that the heavenly credentials are supplied to the remnant church. In the oneness of Christ’s church
          it will be proved that God sent His only begotten Son into the world....</p>
      <p>Works will not buy for us an entrance into heaven. The one great Offering that has been made is ample for all
          who will believe. The love of Christ will animate the believer with new life. He who drinks from the water of
          the fountain of life, will be ﬁlled with the new wine of the kingdom. Faith in Christ will be the means
          whereby the right spirit and motive will actuate the believer, and all goodness and
          <nobr>heavenly-mindedness</nobr> will proceed from him who looks unto Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of his
          faith. Look up to God, look not to men. God is your heavenly Father who is willing patiently to bear with your
          inﬁrmities, and to forgive and heal <nobr>them.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 20, 1894.</p>
