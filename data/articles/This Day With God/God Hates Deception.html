    <h1>God Hates Deception</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the
          house of Jacob their sins. Isaiah 58:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Hypocrisy is peculiarly offensive to God. A large majority of the men and women who profess to know the truth
          prefer smooth messages. They do not desire to have their sins and defects brought before them. They want
          accommodating ministers, who will not arouse conviction by speaking the truth. They choose men who will ﬂatter
          them, and in their turn they ﬂatter the minister who has shown such a “good” spirit, while they revile the
          faithful servant of God....</p>
      <p>Many praise the minister who dwells on the grace and mercy and love of Jesus, who is not particular to enforce
          duties and obligations, who does not warn of the danger of hypocrisy, or present the terrors of God’s
          wrath.</p>
      <p>The Lord’s work is earnest and decided, above deceit and hypocrisy. His true shepherds will not praise and
          exalt man. They will come before the people with a plain “Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.” They
          will bear His message, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear. If men despise God’s Word, and
          trust in oppression, hypocrisy, and worldliness, they must declare against them God’s denunciations, that, if
          possible, they may be aroused to repentance. If they are too proud to repent and confess their errors, to turn
          to God, welcoming His salvation and seeking His favor, the Lord will remove His light from them and will leave
          them to walk in the way they have chosen.</p>
      <p>Those who drive the Lord’s faithful messengers into corners, who discourage them, who stand between them and
          the people, that their message may not have the inﬂuence God designed it should, are answerable for the
          deceptions and heresies that come into the church as a result of their course. They have a fearful account to
          render to God. After the Lord has repeatedly warned His people, and they still refuse to hearken to His voice,
          and will not be instructed, their guilt becomes peculiarly abhorrent to Him. The record of their rebellion is
          written in a book before Him, and will confront them when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be
          <nobr>opened.—Manuscript</nobr> 10, February 16, 1899„ “Words of Warning.”</p>
