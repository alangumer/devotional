    <h1>Shield of Protection</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He came unto his own, and his own received him not. John 1:11.</strong></p>
      <p>He who purchased the human family with His own blood, charges as done to Himself any insult offered to a child
          of His. His law is to extend the shield of divine protection over every soul who puts his trust in Him.</p>
      <p>Christ’s denunciations, the woes that He pronounced, were followed by exclamations of the deepest
          sorrows....</p>
      <p>Just before His cruciﬁxion, He beheld the city [of Jerusalem], and wept over it, saying, “If thou hadst known,
          even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!” (Luke 19:42). Then He paused.
          They had come to the crest of Olivet, and the disciples, catching sight of Jerusalem, were about to burst
          forth unto exclamations of praise; but they saw that their Teacher, in the place of being joyful, was in an
          agony of tears.</p>
      <p>Christ was approaching the end of His mission, and He knew that when that time should come, Jerusalem’s day of
          probation would have ended. But He was reluctant to pronounce the words of doom. For three years He had come,
          seeking fruit and ﬁnding none. During these years one object was ever upon His <nobr>soul—to</nobr> present
          before His thankless, disobedient people the solemn warnings and gracious invitations of heaven. He greatly
          desired that the people should receive His words.</p>
      <p>How graciously He had invited them. How anxiously He had labored to awaken in their hearts the comprehension
          that He was the only hope of Israel, the promised Messiah.... His lifework was to convince His disobedient
          people</p>
      <p>that He was their only hope. He carried them on His heart. He did all that He could do to save them. But at the
          end of His work in this world He was forced to say in an agony of tears, “Ye would not come unto Me that ye
          might have life.” The cloud of divine wrath was gathering over Jerusalem. Christ saw the city beleaguered. He
          saw it lost. In a voice full of tears he exclaimed, “If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,
          the things which belong unto thy</p>
      <p>peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes” (Verse 42).</p>
      <p>I present this feeble representation ...to those who are today going over the same ground, refusing the
          messages of the grace of <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 317a, April 10, 1905„ to “Dear Brethren in the Ministry and
          the Medical Missionary Work.”</p>
