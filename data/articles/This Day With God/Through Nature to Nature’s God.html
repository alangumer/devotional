    <h1>Through Nature to Nature’s God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. Genesis 1:31.</strong></p>
      <p>God speaks to us in nature. It is His voice we hear as we gaze upon the beauty and richness of the natural
          world. We view His glory in the beauteous things His hand has made. We stand and behold His works without a
          veil between. God has given us these things that in beholding the works of His hands, we may learn of
          Him.</p>
      <p>God has given us these precious things as an expression of His love. The Lord is a lover of the beautiful, and
          to please and gratify us He has spread before us the beauties of nature, even as an earthly parent seeks to
          place beautiful things before the children that he loves. The Lord is always pleased to see us happy. Sinful
          as it is with all its imperfections, the Lord has lavished upon this earth the useful and the beautiful. The
          beautiful tinted ﬂowers tell of His tenderness and love. They have a language of their own, reminding us of
          the Giver.</p>
      <p>We may look up through nature to nature’s God. In the beautiful lofty trees, the shrubs, the ﬂowers, God
          reveals His character. He is to be compared to the most beautiful lilies and roses and pinks. I love to look
          upon the things of God in nature, for the Lord impresses upon them His character. In love to us He has given
          them, and He means that we shall have pleasure in them. Then let us not worship the beautiful things in
          nature, but let us look up through them to nature’s God, and be led to worship the Giver. Let these beautiful
          ministries of love answer the purpose of God, and draw our hearts to Him, to be ﬁlled with the beauties of His
          character, and adore His goodness, His compassion, His inexpressible love.</p>
      <p>God is good, and greatly to be praised. His mercies have been freely bestowed upon us. He has surrounded us
          with tokens of His love. The heathen may rage and imagine vain things, but the Lord is unchangeable. He has
          made the strength of the everlasting hills to be a safe retreat for His people. He has prepared the mountains
          and the caves for His oppressed and persecuted children. We may sing, “God is our refuge and strength in time
          of trial.” He who made the towering mountains, the everlasting <nobr>hills—to</nobr> Him we may
          <nobr>look.—Manuscript</nobr> 100, August 20, 1898„ “Through Nature to Nature’s God.”</p>
