      <p><strong>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
          therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
          Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even
          unto the end of the world. Matthew <nobr>28:18-20.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Those in the home ﬁeld who have a knowledge of the truth and of the blessings that this knowledge brings,
          should remember the needs of those who are laboring in new ﬁelds, where the work is hard and facilities
          few....</p>
      <p>The instruction given in the tenth chapter of Matthew shows how the Lord regards those who go forth to work for
          Him in new ﬁelds. Read this chapter. Study what Christ said in regard to the perils the messengers would have
          to meet and the hardships they would have to endure. “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of
          wolves,” He said to His disciples: “be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves” (Matthew 10:16).
          Today those who labor in new ﬁelds have many trials and difﬁculties to encounter. They need the help and
          sympathy of their brethren in the home ﬁeld, where facilities for work are more abundant and means more easily
          obtained.</p>
      <p>Christ’s last words to His disciples show the importance to be placed on the work of spreading the truth. Just
          before His ascension He gave them the commission, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
          the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
          I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world” (chap. 28:19, 20).</p>
      <p>Christ did not conﬁne His labors to one place. Of His work we read, “...And he said unto them, I must preach
          the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. And he preached in the synagogues of
          Galilee” (Luke 4:43, 44).</p>
      <p>Would that all who have the light of truth would follow the example set by Christ, and not expend their
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> time and ability and means in one or two places, when the light of truth is to go to
          all the world. The wonderful display of grace shown in the gospel message is to be carried to all
          <nobr>places.—Letter</nobr> 92, April 8, 1902„ to “My Brethren in Responsible Positions in the Medical
          Missionary Work.”</p>
