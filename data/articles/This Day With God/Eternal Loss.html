    <h1>Eternal Loss</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
          prepared for them that love him. 1 Corinthians 2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Every sin, every unrighteous action, every transgression of the law of God, tells with a thousandfold more
          force upon the actor than the sufferer. Every time one of the glorious faculties with which God has enriched
          man is abused or misused, that faculty loses forever a portion of its vigor and will never be as it was before
          the abuse it suffered. Every abuse inﬂicted upon our moral nature in this life is felt not only for time but
          for eternity. Though God may forgive the sinner, yet eternity will not make up that voluntary loss sustained
          in this life.</p>
      <p>To go forth into the next, the future life, deprived of half the power which might be carried there is a
          terrible thought. The days of probation lost here in acquiring a ﬁtness for heaven, is a loss which will never
          be recovered. The capacities of enjoyment will be less in the future life for the misdemeanors and abuse of
          moral powers in this life. However high we might attain in the future life, we might soar higher and still
          higher, if we had made the most of our <nobr>God-given</nobr> privileges and golden opportunities to improve
          our faculties here in this probationary existence....</p>
      <p>We are all under one or the other of two great captains. One, the Creator of man and of the world, is the
          greatest of all. All owe Him the allegiance of their whole being, the devotion of their entire affection. If
          the mind is given to His control, and if God has the molding and developing of the powers of the mind, new
          moral power will be received daily from the Source of all wisdom and all strength. Moral blessings and divine
          beauties will reward the efforts of everyone whose mind is heaven bent. We may grasp
          <nobr>revelations—heavenly</nobr><nobr>beauties—that</nobr> lie beyond the short vision of the worldling, that
          outshine the imagination of the greatest mind and the most learned philosopher who has not connected himself
          with inﬁnite power....</p>
      <p>Justice, honor, love, and truth are the attributes of God’s throne. They are the principles of His government
          which is to be established on the earth, made pure by the ﬁre of His retributive justice. These are the jewels
          to be sought after and cherished for time and for eternity. In view of these things, ...build your character
          not after the worldly standard, but for <nobr>eternity.—Letter</nobr> 41, December 7, 1877„ to F. E. Belden, a
          <nobr>19-year-old</nobr> nephew.</p>
