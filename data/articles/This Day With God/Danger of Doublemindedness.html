    <h1>Danger of Doublemindedness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. James 1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many who would serve Christ provided they could serve themselves also. But this cannot be. The Lord
          will not accept cowards in His army. There can be no dissembling. Christ’s followers must stand ready to serve
          Him at all times and in every way that may be required. God will accept only
          <nobr>true-hearted,</nobr><nobr>level-headed,</nobr><nobr>all-round</nobr> men. “He that is not with me is
          against me,” Christ declared; “and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad” (Matthew 12:30).</p>
      <p>Many have tried neutrality in a crisis, but they have failed in their purpose. No one can maintain a neutral
          ground. Those who endeavor to do this will fulﬁll Christ’s words, “No man can serve two masters: for either he
          will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve
          God and mammon” (chap. 6:24). Those who begin their Christian life by being half and half, whatever may be
          their intentions, will at last be found enlisted on the enemy’s side.</p>
      <p>Double minded men and women are Satan’s best allies. Whatever favorable opinion they may have of themselves,
          they are dissemblers. All who are loyal to God and the truth must stand ﬁrmly for the right because it is
          right. To yoke up with those that are unconsecrated and yet be loyal to the truth, is simply an impossibility.
          We cannot unite with those who are serving themselves, who are working on worldly plans, and not lose our
          connection with the heavenly Counsellor. We may recover ourselves from the snare of the enemy, but we are
          bruised and wounded, and our experience is dwarfed. “Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity
          with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God” (James 4:4).</p>
      <p>“He that loveth his life shall lose it” (John 12:25). When a man loses the shield of a good conscience, he
          knows that he has lost the cooperation of heavenly angels. God is not working in him. Another spirit inspires
          him. And to be an apostate, a traitor to the cause of God, is much more serious than death; it means the loss
          of eternal <nobr>life.—Manuscript</nobr> 87, August 19, 1897„ “All That Will Live Godly in Christ Jesus Shall
          Suffer Persecution.”</p>
