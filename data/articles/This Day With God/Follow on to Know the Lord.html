    <h1>Follow on to Know the Lord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Acts 9:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who are striving to be overcomers will be pursued by the temptations of the enemy. Satan will tempt them
          to corrupt the principles which all must maintain who would reach the high standard that God has set before
          them. Satan rejoices when he can lead souls to follow mistaken ideas, until their names are blotted out of the
          book of life and recorded among the names of the unjust. We can overcome only in the way that Christ
          <nobr>overcame—by</nobr> wholehearted obedience to every commandment of God. True religion is obedience to all
          the commandments of God.</p>
      <p>Every soul who is saved must surrender his own plans, and follow where Christ leads the way. The understanding
          must be yielded up to Christ for Him to cleanse and reﬁne and purify. This will always be done when we receive
          aright the teachings of Christ. O, how much we need a more intimate acquaintance with Him! We need to enter
          into His purpose, and to carry out His will, saying with the whole heart, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to
          do?” ...</p>
      <p>The child of God is to reach out for higher and still higher attainments. He is to confess every sin, that by
          his example others may be helped to confess their sins and cherish the faith that works by love to purify the
          soul. He is to be constantly on guard, never standing still, never turning back, but ever pressing on to the
          mark of the high calling of God in Christ....</p>
      <p>We should keep ever before us the fact that time is short. Iniquity is increasing on every hand. The righteous
          are set as lights in the world. Through them the glory of God is to be revealed to the world. Keep ever before
          you the solemn events of the <nobr>future—the</nobr> great review of the judgment and the coming of Christ.
          You with your family are to prepare for that day....</p>
      <p>Follow on day by day to know the Lord, rejoicing that it is your privilege to say at His coming, as you stand
          with His faithful, waiting children, “This is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: ...we will
          be glad and rejoice in his salvation” (Isaiah <nobr>25:9).—Letter</nobr> 92, November 9, 1911„ to a husband
          and wife.</p>
