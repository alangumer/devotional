      <p><strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
          he may devour. 1 Peter 5:8.</strong></p>
      <p>We have a cunning devil to work against! Christ alone is mighty and fully able to match his power, therefore we
          must have Jesus with us every moment. We are sleepy, stupid, and do not sense the arts and gins and snares of
          Satan, set for unwary feet. Therefore we must know how we step, that every move is in God. Self must not come
          in here to make itself heard.</p>
      <p>The destruction of souls is the regular employment of Satan and his agents upon the earth. The salvation of
          souls is the work of every follower of Christ, however weak. When [a man’s] selﬁsh interest is made ﬁrst and
          the salvation of souls comes secondary, if at all, that man is working on Satan’s side, for his very
          pretensions are a snare to lead others off the track, that they shall not consider the kingdom of God and His
          righteousness ﬁrst. Satan is getting the start of all such workers. The salvation of souls comes ﬁrst, always,
          for Satan as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour. We must snatch souls away from his path.
          We must have clear foresight, discernment, and faith, and work as if to save a perishing life, of which some
          carelessness on our part might be the cause of death.</p>
      <p>Missionary work, God help us to understand what it is, and how we must engage in it. Every missionary should be
          wholly the Lord’s, pressing forward to attain to the perfection of Christian character. The standard of piety
          must be lifted high. Every species of idolatry must be sacriﬁced. Souls, precious souls, must be
          saved....</p>
      <p>One man, when the church in Scotland was making some resolutions to compromise the faith, to concede their
          staunch principles, was determined never to yield a jot or tittle. He went upon his knees before God and thus
          pleaded, “Give me Scotland or I die.” His importunate prayer was heard. Oh, that the earnest prayer of faith
          may arise everywhere, Give me souls buried now in the rubbish of error, or I die! Bring them to the knowledge
          of the truth as it is in Jesus.</p>
      <p>We must carry the burden of souls upon our hearts; every selﬁsh consideration must give way to this. The cost
          of the blood of Christ shows the value of the <nobr>soul.—Letter</nobr> 20, June 11, 1883„ to W. C.
