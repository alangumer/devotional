    <h1>Divine Grace, Our Greatest Need</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of. 1 Corinthians 9:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Genuine conversion brings us daily into communion with God. There will be temptations to meet, and a strong
          undercurrent drawing us from God to our former state of indifference and sinful forgetfulness of God. No human
          heart can remain strong without divine grace. No man can remain converted unless he takes care of himself and
          the Master has a care for him. Unless the heart holds fast to God, and God holds fast to him, he will become
          <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr> and exalted and will surely stumble and fall. The power of God through faith was
          Paul’s dependence. “I live; yet not I,” he exclaims in his humility, “but Christ liveth in me” (Galatians
          2:20). “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so ﬁght I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under
          my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should
          be a castaway” (1 Corinthians 9:26, 27).</p>
      <p>Paul was in such constant dread, lest his evil propensities should get the better of him, that he was
          constantly battling, with ﬁrm resistance, unruly appetites and passions. If the great apostle felt like
          trembling in view of his weakness, who has a right to feel <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr> and boastful? The moment
          we begin to feel <nobr>self-sufﬁcient</nobr> and conﬁdent then we are in danger of a disgraceful failure.</p>
      <p>Our only sure defense against besetting sins is prayer, daily and hourly prayer. Not one day zealous and the
          next careless, but through watchfulness and earnestness becoming vitalized by intercourse with God. Prayer is
          necessary, and we should not wait for feeling, but pray, earnestly pray, whether we feel like it or not.
          Heaven is open to our prayers. Prayer is the channel that conducts our gratitude and yearnings of soul for the
          divine blessing to the throne of God, to be returned to us in refreshing showers of divine grace. With very
          many, this channel is allowed to freeze up, and then the connection with heaven is interrupted.... Oh, that we
          would spend more time upon our knees and less time</p>
      <p>in planning for ourselves and in thinking we may do some great <nobr>thing.—Letter</nobr> 52, September 25,
          1874„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
