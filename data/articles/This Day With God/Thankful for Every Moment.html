    <h1>Thankful for Every Moment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. John 14:18. Although I did not have good sleep
          during the night, my peace was like a</strong></p>
      <p>river. The love of Jesus grows in my heart, and I do love Him, and my heart ﬂows out in grateful thanksgiving.
          The preciousness of divine truth presents itself with such clearness and force to my mind that I long to
          express it to all that I can reach to comfort, and encourage them with the consolation wherewith I myself also
          am comforted. I feel not the slightest depression of spirits. Pleasant views and ideas present themselves to
          me like precious views of gold, and my heart is all aglow and I feel an ardor of soul that seems longing to
          express itself.</p>
      <p>In reading the Scriptures, light seems to shine upon every <nobr>letter—sentences</nobr> seem so fresh and new
          and <nobr>important—and</nobr> my heart is in complete harmony with the whole. I am thankful every moment,
          even when awake at night and unable to sleep.</p>
      <p>I know in my daily experience that the Holy Spirit is present as I read His Word, planting the truth in the
          heart, that it may be expressed in the life and character to others. The Spirit of God takes the truth from
          the sacred page, where He Himself hath placed it, and stamps it on the soul. What holy joy, what hope and
          consolation can be ours to impart to others.</p>
      <p>I attended the afternoon meeting [at Ballarat, N.S.W., Australia], and there were more people present to hear
          the word than I expected. I spoke from John <nobr>14:15-24.</nobr> The Lord gave me words to speak to the
          people to present before them the precious assurances that Christ has given to all those who know and do His
          commandments.</p>
      <p>Jesus asks an evidence of their love for Him. “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). If it were
          not possible for us to keep His commandments, why does He speak words to us of this kind? Now the following
          verse opens to us a treasure of knowledge. “And I will pray the Father, [although I be absent from you] and he
          shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever” (Verse 16)....</p>
      <p>Is not this promise sure? Can any words from the lips of God’s only begotten Son make it more decided and
          <nobr>positive?—Manuscript</nobr> 2, December 3, 1892„ diary.</p>
