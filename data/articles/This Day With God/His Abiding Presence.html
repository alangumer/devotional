    <h1>His Abiding Presence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
          pleasures for evermore. Psalm 16:11.</strong></p>
      <p>This world is our <nobr>school—a</nobr> school of discipline and training. We are placed here to form
          characters like the character of Christ, and to acquire the habits and the language of the higher life.
          Inﬂuences opposed to good, abound on every side. The developments of sin are becoming so full, so deep, so
          abhorrent to God, that soon He will arise in majesty to shake terribly the earth. So artful are the plans of
          the enemy, so specious the complications that he brings about, that those who are weak in the faith cannot
          discern his deceptions. They fall into the snares prepared by Satan, who works through human instrumentalities
          to deceive if possible the very elect. Only those who are closely connected with God will be able to discern
          the falsehoods, the intrigues, of the enemy....</p>
      <p>Think of the glory awaiting those who overcome! They will see the face of Him in whose presence there is
          fulness of joy and at whose right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</p>
      <p>Let us allow God to control our minds. Let us not say or do anything that will turn a fellow being from the
          right way.</p>
      <p>I feel very sad as I think of how few there are who show that they have tasted the deep blessedness of
          communion with a risen, ascended Saviour. Men of the world are striving for the supremacy. God’s followers are
          to keep Christ ever in view, inquiring, Is this the way of the Lord? A holy desire to live the life of Christ
          is to ﬁll our hearts. In Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. In Him are hid all the treasures of
          wisdom and knowledge.</p>
      <p>O that our people could realize what advantages would be theirs if they would look constantly to Jesus! “We
          all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory
          to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2 Corinthians 3:18). He is our Alpha and our Omega. Pressing
          close to His side and holding communion with Him, we become like Him. Through the transforming power of the
          Spirit of Christ, we are changed in heart and life. His words are engraven on the tablets of the soul, and we
          are His witnesses, representing Him in the daily <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 47, March 28, 1903„ to F. C.
          Gilbert, a Jewish minister working for his own people.</p>
