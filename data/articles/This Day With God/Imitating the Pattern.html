    <h1>Imitating the Pattern</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins,
          hath quickened us together with Christ, ...and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly
          places in Christ Jesus. Ephesians <nobr>2:4-6.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Where the Spirit of God is, there is meekness, patience, gentleness, and longsuffering; there is a tenderness
          of soul, a mildness which savors of Christ. But these fruits are not manifested by the unconverted. The more
          real need there is for this class to humble themselves before God, the less sense they have of their real
          standing, and the more <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> they assume. The more they claim to be led by God, the more
          overbearing they are to all around them, the more incapable of receiving any reproof, the more impatient of
          contradiction, and the less they feel the need of counsel. Instead of being meek and gentle, easy to be
          entreated, full of mercy, love, and good fruits, they are exacting and tyrannical; instead of being swift to
          hear and slow to speak, they are slow to hear and swift to speak.</p>
      <p>They are unwilling to learn of anyone. The temper is ﬁery and vehement. There is a set determination, a
          ﬁerceness in the very looks and deportment. They speak and act as though they would take the work out of God’s
          hands and pass judgment themselves upon those whom they consider in the wrong.</p>
      <p>A true disciple of Christ will seek to imitate the Pattern. His love will lead to perfect obedience. He will
          study to do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven. He whose heart is still deﬁled with sin cannot
          be zealous of good works; and is not careful to abstain from evil, is not vigilant and watchful over his own
          motives and conduct, is not jealous over his unruly tongue; he is not careful to deny self and lift the cross
          of Christ. These poor, deceived souls fail to keep the ﬁrst four precepts of the decalogue, deﬁning the duty
          of man to God, neither do they keep the last six commandments, deﬁning the duty of man to his fellow men.</p>
      <p>The fruits of the Spirit, ruling in the heart and controlling the life, are love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
          gentleness, bowels of mercies, and humbleness of mind. True believers walk after the Spirit, and the Spirit of
          God dwells in <nobr>them.—Manuscript</nobr> 1, October 9, 1878„ “Church Difﬁculties.”</p>
