    <h1>The Power of Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
          and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke. Isaiah 58:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Truth, precious truth, is sanctifying in its inﬂuence. The sanctiﬁcation of the soul by the operation of the
          Holy Spirit is the implanting of Christ’s nature in humanity. It is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
          revealed in character, and the graces of Christ brought into active exercise in good works. Thus the character
          is transformed more and more perfectly after the image of Christ, in righteousness and true holiness. There
          are broad requirements in divine truth stretching out interfacing into one line after another of good works.
          The truths of the gospel are not unconnected; uniting they form one string of heavenly jewels, as in the
          personal work of Christ, and like threads of gold they run through the whole of Christian work and
          experience....</p>
      <p>Let it be printed on the mind that mercy and the love of God are to be expressed to the children of God. Search
          heaven and earth, and there is no truth revealed more powerful than that which is manifested in mercy to the
          very ones who need your sympathy and aid in breaking the yoke, and setting free the oppressed. Here the truth
          is lived, the truth is obeyed, the truth is taught as it is in Jesus.</p>
      <p>There is a great amount of truth professed, but truth practiced in relieving our fellow men is of great
          inﬂuence, reaching unto heaven, and compassing eternity. Every soul in our world is on trial; every man’s
          experience, the common life history, tells in unmistakable language whether he is a doer of Christ’s words and
          His works. There is constantly recurring a large array of little things that God alone sees; to act out in
          these things the principles of truth will bring a precious reward. The great and important things are
          recognized by nearly all, but the knitting of these things with the supposed smaller things of life and
          closely connecting them as one, is too rarely done by professed Christians. Religion is too much profession,
          and too little reality.</p>
      <p>Divine truth exercises little inﬂuence upon our fellow men, when it should exercise much inﬂuence through our
          practice. Truth, precious truth, is Jesus in the life, a living, acting <nobr>principle.—Manuscript</nobr> 34,
          August 3, 1894,.</p>
