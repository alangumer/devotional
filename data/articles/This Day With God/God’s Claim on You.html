    <h1>God’s Claim on You</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
          righteousness unto God. Romans 6:13.</strong></p>
      <p>If you expect to be loved of God and to retain the presence of holy angels, you must have a submissive spirit.
          Be willing to be instructed and to be led. And seek to follow in the path of virtue and holiness.</p>
      <p>God has claims upon you. He has blessed you with life and with health and with capabilities, reasoning powers
          that you may, if you will, greatly improve or you may abuse by yielding these powers or qualities of mind to
          the control of Satan. You are responsible for the ability which God has given you. You may, by making the most
          of your privileges, ﬁt yourself for a position of usefulness and duty. You need not be aspiring to do a great
          work, aspiring after great things; but you may be doing your work, small though it may be, feeling your
          responsibility of doing this work to God’s acceptance. And when you do this small work all right, God will
          entrust to you a still greater work. There is importance attached to the course you pursue. Angels of God are
          watching Mary [not otherwise identiﬁed] to see what character she develops. God is weighing moral worth and a
          record is kept in heaven of your acts, of all your deeds, and you will meet this record by and by.</p>
      <p>Remember, God will make use of all His children if they will surrender to Him. He has a place and work for all.
          There are many, you among the number, who think it not possible that God can use them. Think not this longer.
          You may do your little work in a manner to glorify God. The rill does not refuse to pursue its narrow channel
          because it is not a river. The grass does not refuse to grow because it has not the proportions of stately
          trees. The star does not refuse to shine because it is not the sun. Oh, no. Everything in nature has its
          appointed work and murmurs not at its position. In spiritual things every man and woman has his or her own
          peculiar sphere and vocation. The interest God requires will be proportionate to the amount of entrusted
          capital according to the measure of the gift of Christ.... Now is your time and privilege to ...show a</p>
      <p>stability of character that will make you of real moral worth. Christ has a right to your service. Yield to Him
          <nobr>heartily.—Letter</nobr> 30, August 22, 1875„ to “Dear Sister Mary.”</p>
