    <h1>Let Christ Be Your Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
          give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. John 4:14.</strong></p>
      <p>God calls upon all who have been drinking of the water of life to lead others to the fountain.... “I Jesus have
          sent mine angel to testify unto you these things</p>
      <p>in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star” (Revelation 22:16).
          Christ is to be your light. Christ is to be your sufﬁciency and power. Christ is the root, and He sustains
          every branch by His power....</p>
      <p>Every converted soul has a work to do. We are to receive grace in order to freely give grace. We are to let the
          light shine forth from the bright and morning star, to shed forth light in works of <nobr>self-denial</nobr>
          and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> following the example that Christ has given us in His own life and character.
          We are to draw from the root that substance that will enable us to bear much fruit. Every soul who has heard
          the divine invitation is to echo the message from hill to valley, saying to those with whom he comes in
          contact, “Come.” ...</p>
      <p>The love of Jesus in the heart will always be revealed in tender compassion for the souls of those for whom
          Christ paid so dear a price. “Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby
          we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.... And whatsoever</p>
      <p>we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
          sight” (1 John <nobr>3:18-22).</nobr> There is no such thing as a loveless Christian....</p>
      <p>Every true believer catches the beams from the Morning Star and transmits the light to those who sit in
          darkness. Not only do they shine amid the darkness of their own neighborhood, but as a church they shine forth
          to regions beyond. The Lord expects every man to do his duty. Every one who unites with the church is to be
          one with Christ to diffuse the beams of the Morning Star, and becoming the light of the world, Christ and His
          people are to be copartners in the great work of saving the <nobr>world.—Manuscript</nobr> 51, November 14,
          1894,.</p>
