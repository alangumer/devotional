      <p><strong>He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 1 John
          2:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Many are on the enchanted ground of the enemy. Things of the least <nobr>importance—foolish</nobr> social
          parties, singing, jesting, <nobr>joking—engross</nobr> their minds and they serve God with a divided heart. In
          these things you have one unseen in your midst, helping <nobr>you—Satan</nobr> is present, full of hellish
          exultation. The declaration of Christ, “No man can serve two masters” (Matthew 6:24), is unheeded.</p>
      <p>After the ascension of Christ, the Holy Spirit did not immediately descend. There were ten days after His
          ascension before the Holy Spirit was given. This time was devoted by the disciples to most earnest preparation
          for receiving so precious an endowment. The rich treasures of heaven were poured out to them after they had
          searched their own hearts diligently and had sacriﬁced every idol. They were before God, humbling their souls,
          strengthening their faith, confessing their sins. And their hearts were in harmony with one another. “And when
          the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a
          sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it ﬁlled all the house where they were sitting” (Acts 2:1,
          2). The church needs a similar experience right here at the great heart of the work. [Battle Creek, Michigan,
          denominational headquarters from 1855 to 1903.] Are we searching our hearts, preparing for the heavenly grace
          to be received? The Lord is waiting to be gracious.</p>
      <p>The Lord will reveal Himself to His people, but they must be unitedly engaged in the work of seeking the
          Lord.... The work which is to be carried</p>
      <p>forward at this time is a most important one. It is a life and death question....</p>
      <p>Shall the enemy [be allowed], right at this solemn time, to bring in a condition of <nobr>things—of</nobr>
          diversion and <nobr>pleasure—to</nobr> absorb the mind and ﬁll it with vain, triﬂing thoughts that have no
          place for God, eternity, or <nobr>heaven?—Manuscript</nobr> 38, 1890, diary, Battle Creek, Michigan, Jan. 2,
          1890.</p>
