    <h1>Preach the Word</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye
          their fear, nor be afraid. Isaiah 8:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Our work is to proclaim to the world the ﬁrst, second, and third angels’ messages. In the discharge of our
          duties, we are neither to despise nor fear our enemies. To bind ourselves up by contracts with those not of
          our faith is not in the order of God.</p>
      <p>We are to treat with kindness and courtesy those who refuse to be loyal to God, but we are never, never to
          unite with them in counsel, regarding the vital interests of His work, for this is not the way of the Lord.
          Putting our trust in God, we are to move steadily forward, doing His work with unselﬁshness, in humble
          dependence upon Him, committing ourselves and all that concerns our present and future to His wise providence,
          holding the beginning of our conﬁdence ﬁrm unto the end, remembering that it is not because of our worthiness
          that we receive the blessings of heaven, but because of the worthiness of Christ, and our acceptance, through
          faith in Him, of God’s abounding grace.</p>
      <p>I pray that my brethren may realize that the third angel’s message means much to us, and that the observance of
          the true Sabbath is to be the sign that distinguishes those who serve God from those who serve Him not. Let
          those awake who have become sleepy and indifferent. We are called to be holy, and we should carefully avoid
          giving the impression that it is of little consequence whether or not we retain the peculiar features of our
          faith. Upon us rests the solemn obligation of taking a more decided stand for truth and righteousness than we
          have taken in the past.</p>
      <p>The line of demarcation between those who keep the commandments of God and those who do not, is to be revealed
          with unmistakable clearness. We are conscientiously to honor God, diligently using every means of keeping in
          covenant relation with Him, that we may receive His <nobr>blessings—the</nobr> blessings so essential for the
          people who are to be so severely tried. To give the impression that our faith, our religion, is not a
          dominating power in our lives, is greatly to dishonor <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 128, July 6, 1902„ to the
          General Conference Committee and the Medical Missionary Board.</p>
