    <h1>God’s Constant Appeal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. 1 Timothy
          5:25.</strong></p>
      <p>Many who love <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> and who murmur at the straight testimony of the Laodicean message,
          are ignorant of how sinful their actions really are; but in the judgment they will be ashamed of their course
          of ingratitude and rebellion against the One who has borne so long with them, and who has not cut them off in
          their sins. No confession, no weeping will then avail for those who have spoiled their record. Many who now
          claim to be the disciples of Christ, will be numbered among those who would not repent, but who have deceived
          their souls unto their eternal ruin. The evasion of truth will not give courage to any soul in the day of
          judgment to open his lips in <nobr>self-defense.</nobr> Then the books will be opened that bear the record of
          the works of every individual....</p>
      <p>God has sent messages from His Word to the souls who are living careless lives, and who are unashamed of their
          wrong course of action. I heard the words spoken: “Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is
          hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God? Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that
          the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is
          no searching of his understanding” (Isaiah 40:27, 28). If the careless, <nobr>self-indulgent</nobr> souls
          would seek the Lord and confess their sins, they would see how their unconverted lives lead others astray, and
          they would repent and be converted....</p>
      <p>God is constantly appealing to the human heart, bidding it recognize His love and mercy, and accept His
          righteousness in the place of the principles of evil. Thus He has pleaded with mankind in all ages. In Noah’s
          day Christ spoke to men through a human agency and preached to those who were in bondage to sin. He came to
          Israel enshrouded in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of ﬁre by night. He it was who educated that
          vast multitude in their wilderness wandering....</p>
      <p>There are many who do not weigh these things sufﬁciently. The instruction given to Israel should be understood
          today by every soul living. Man may claim great intelligence, but he needs more than human intelligence in
          order to grasp the revelations of the <nobr>gospel.—Letter</nobr> 106, September 26, 1909„ “To Our Churches in
          Oakland and Berkeley.”</p>
