    <h1>Childlike Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
          Matthew 18:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus is your best Friend. Live by daily faith on the Son of God. Let your course of action be such that God
          can approve. Then you will be a blessing to others.... Do not outgrow the simple faith and trust of your
          childhood. When</p>
      <p>sick, your ﬁrst request was, “Father, Mother, pray that the Lord will heal me and forgive my sins.” When prayer
          was offered in your behalf, you made your simple prayer and thanked the Lord He had heard and answered, and
          with perfect faith and conﬁdence you said, “I shall get well. The Lord has blessed me.” You slept in perfect
          peace, in conﬁdence that holy angels would guard your bed.</p>
      <p>Be a child again. Cast all your burdens and sorrows on Him who alone can give rest to the weary heart and peace
          to the troubled soul. If you would learn anew the precious secret of happiness in this life and how you may
          attain the future, immortal life, be assured you must again be a child in trust, in obedience, in love. If you
          only do your duty bravely, yet cheerfully, as a happy child of God, you will reﬂect rays of sunshine upon
          others.</p>
      <p>I charge you as one who knows, look up to God with the simple faith you had in your childhood and say, “Father,
          I am weary, give me rest. Unite my ignorance to Thy wisdom, my weakness to Thy strength, my frailty to Thy
          enduring might. Shield me with Thy protecting hand in life’s conﬂicts. Save me from the vigilant foe who
          haunts my steps.” Then believe, my son, and you will realize even more than you expected.</p>
      <p>Our only safety now is to live a life of faith and good works. Your heavenly Father knows your every trial. He
          is acquainted with all your inﬁrmities. He will be to you an ever present help in time of need and He will
          withhold no good thing from them that fear and love Him. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Our
          compassionate Saviour will never be indifferent to any pain or sorrow or grief His children suffer....</p>
      <p>All that you lose and all that you gain, prosperity and adversity, let it make you more like Jesus, the divine
          Pattern. Your happiness will be secured in preserving your childlike trust, cherishing always the beauty and
          loveliness of a meek and quiet <nobr>spirit.—Letter</nobr> 56, October 28, 1874„ to Edson White.</p>
