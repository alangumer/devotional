      <p><strong>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. It is good that a man
          should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. Lamentations 3:25, 26.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord would have us ask that we may receive. There are the heavenly messengers waiting for the sincere
          petition and they draw nigh to the hungry, thirsting soul. Then let your whole souls go out after God. Wait on
          the Lord. The heavenly messengers will empty themselves into the golden tubes ﬂowing into the golden bowls to
          enlighten others. If you ask believing you will receive. Never, never be destitute of the golden oil, for this
          will keep your lamps burning.</p>
      <p>Believe ye receive the things ye ask for and ye shall have them. Come with humble heart, but presenting the
          promise. Then believe you do receive. The name, the <nobr>all-prevailing</nobr> name of our Saviour, is our
          assurance and our boldness. God presents Himself to us as a hearer of prayer. Keep on right ground with God,
          so that you may have the witness of the Spirit that you are one of His elect and faithful, trusting ones.</p>
      <p>Never allow Satan to discourage you. Trust yourself not in the hands of M_____, but in the hands of God.
          Practice prayer; cultivate humility and meekness; but commit the keeping of your soul to God. Depend in all
          that you do on the Holy Spirit, for He is our strength, our efﬁciency. The Lord is ever training us through
          difﬁculties. Pray, pray; be instant in prayer. Commit everything to God in <nobr>prayer—your</nobr> business
          cares, your disappointments, your joys, your fears.</p>
      <p>Do this, N_____, and you will have a sense of God’s presence, and thankfulness and gratitude will ﬂow forth
          from your heart and lips in vocal praise. Your heart will be mellow, and you will make melody to God in your
          heart....</p>
      <p>Rise to a high standard. Do not indulge in cheap talk, but let the soul go forth in expressions from your lips
          of the love of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Let us always be sober, reverential, in dealing with the Word of God. There is an eternal consequence in our
          rightly employing our talents of speech, our talents of voice, and every qualiﬁcation given us to exercise and
          improve. We are to be pure in speech, holy in all manner of conversation, drawing nigh to God and He drawing
          nigh unto <nobr>us.—Letter</nobr> 166, January 14, 1897„ to a worker couple.</p>
