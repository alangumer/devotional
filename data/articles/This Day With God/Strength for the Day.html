    <h1>Strength for the Day</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As thy days, so shall thy strength be.... The eternal God is thy refuge,</strong></p>
      <p>and underneath are the everlasting arms. Deuteronomy <nobr>33:25-27.</nobr></p>
      <p>I am so thankful to my heavenly Father for His daily blessings to me. About a week ago, I felt completely worn
          out with the effort I had put forth in writing. My mind would not work, and I felt much depressed. I had
          almost given up hope of ever feeling rested again. But one night I prayed to God most earnestly for His
          strengthening, healing power to rest upon me, that I might be able to write out some things that ought to be
          published. I then went to sleep. In the night season I seemed to be speaking to different congregations, in
          regard to the healing, quickening power of the Holy Spirit. At <nobr>half-past</nobr> two I awoke. My headache
          was gone, and the soothing inﬂuence of the Spirit of God rested upon me. I walked the ﬂoor of my room, and
          praised God. I then took my pen in hand, and found that my mind was clear, and that I could write as well as
          ever. Since this experience, I have written a great deal. Our Saviour is the most skillful physician in the
          world. I praise Him for the marked blessing that He bestowed upon me at this time.</p>
      <p>True religion is a religion that keeps constantly in view the honor and glory of God. We are to regard our
          heavenly Father with holy fear and reverence. He requires of His <nobr>blood-bought</nobr> heritage a cheerful
          obedience. As we realize His great love, our hearts will be inspired with gratitude, we shall serve Him with
          cheerfulness, and ﬁrmly, conﬁdently put our trust wholly in Him.</p>
      <p>I long to express in my life service the joy of Christ. I long to be imbued with His Spirit, that I may be a
          blessing to others. We have the promise, “I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for
          ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: and I will make an everlasting covenant with
          them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they
          shall not depart from me” (Jeremiah 32:39, 40).</p>
      <p>God is “great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to
          give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings” (Verse
          <nobr>19).—Letter</nobr> 139, April 17, 1904„ to Robert Vickery, a layman on the Illinois Conference
          Committee.</p>
