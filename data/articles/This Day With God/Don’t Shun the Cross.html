      <p><strong>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an inﬁdel? 2
          Corinthians 6:15.</strong></p>
      <p>In the last vision given, I was shown that you were anxious that your children should have as much religion as
          will render them agreeable to all, without incurring the censure of any. The restraining inﬂuence of the
          Spirit of God has affected them but little....</p>
      <p>When we profess to be servants of Christ we should no longer serve the world, and should not have union or
          fellowship with those who reject the truths which we deem sacred. I was pointed to 1 John 2:6. “He that saith
          he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.” “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch
          cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the
          vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for
          without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:4, 5)....</p>
      <p>You cannot measure yourselves by the world or by the opinions of others. Your only safety is to compare your
          position with what it would have been had your course been continually onward and upward since you professed
          to be Christ’s followers. Your moral character is passing in review before God. You are weighed in the balance
          of the sanctuary, and, if your spirituality does not correspond with the beneﬁts and privileges conferred upon
          you, you are found wanting. Your path should have been growing brighter and brighter, and you bringing forth
          much fruit to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>You are wanting, yet rest as unconcerned and well satisﬁed as though the cloud went before you by day and the
          pillar of ﬁre by night as tokens of God’s favor. You reckon yourselves among the chosen, peculiar people of
          God, and yet have no manifestations or evidences of the power of God to save to the uttermost. You have not
          separated from the world as God requires His people to be separate....</p>
      <p>The people of God are in constant warfare to maintain their peculiar and holy character, and under no condition
          or circumstance is the cross of Christ to be shunned or laid <nobr>aside.—Letter</nobr> 9, October 12, 1861„ a
          personal testimony.</p>
