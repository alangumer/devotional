    <h1>How to Meet Opposition</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and
          oppositions of science falsely so called: which some professing have erred concerning the faith. 1 Timothy
          6:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>In our work for God we shall meet with much opposition. By falsehood and deception the Jews strove to keep the
          people from believing on Christ. Today false teachers will resort to any means to keep people from obtaining a
          knowledge of the truth. There are those who love error more than they love truth, because truth is opposed to
          their inclinations and their course of action. They refuse to repent and be converted, even though the
          evidence for truth is clear and convincing. They do not want to search the Scriptures, to see if these things
          are so. There lies the cross to be lifted, but they are unwilling to deny self. God asks them to keep holy His
          Sabbath, but they refuse to give up their own way....</p>
      <p>A great and solemn work is before the people of God. They are to come close to Christ in
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> their one aim being to give the message of mercy to
          all the world. Some will work in one way and some in another, as the Lord shall call and lead them. But they
          are all to strive together, seeking to make the work a perfect whole. With pen and voice God’s servants are to
          labor for Him. The printed word of truth is to be translated into different tongues. To all peoples the gospel
          is to be preached....</p>
      <p>Unconsecrated minds will place hindrances in the way of God’s work, as they have done in the past. But do not
          stop to enter into controversy and create disagreeable issues. If hindered in one way, be ready to honor God
          by working in a way that is open. In due time obstacles that now seem insurmountable will be removed. God can
          remove obstructions in ways most unexpected when He sees that by doing this He can best glorify His
          name....</p>
      <p>Trials will come, for there are many who are walking at cross purposes with God. Be sure that you are walking
          before Him in meekness and humility. You may, yes, you will be misjudged, but the evil talkers will be ashamed
          if you constantly reveal the sweetness of Christ’s <nobr>character.—Letter</nobr> 193, July 31, 1901„ to “Dear
          Children.”</p>
