      <p><strong>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. Psalm 119:105.</strong></p>
      <p>The worker for God is not left without a pattern. He is given an example which, if followed, will make him a
          spectacle to the world, to angels and to men. He is bidden to glorify God by carrying out unselﬁsh aims and
          purposes. The Lord understands man’s nature, and He holds up before him the laws of the kingdom of heaven,
          which he is to honor and obey. He places the Bible in his hands, as the guidebook that will show him what is
          truth, and what he must do in order to inherit eternal life. This book draws the attention from temporal
          interests to spiritual realities. It tells man, fallen and sinful though he is, that he can become a prince
          and a king in the heavenly courts, an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ.</p>
      <p>God sees how strong man’s inclination is to accumulate earthly treasure, and in the highways and byways of life
          His voice is heard saying, “What shall it proﬁt a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
          soul?” (Mark 8:36). “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and
          where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
          rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will
          your heart be also” (Matthew <nobr>6:19-21).</nobr></p>
      <p>God’s messengers are commissioned to take up the very work that Christ did while on this earth. They are to
          give themselves to every line of ministry that He carried on. With earnestness and sincerity they are to tell
          men of the unsearchable riches and the immortal treasures of heaven. They are to be ﬁlled with the Holy
          Spirit. They are to repeat Heaven’s offers of peace and pardon. They are to point to the gates of the city of
          God, saying, “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may
          enter in through the gates into the city” (Revelation 22:14)....</p>
      <p>He expects everyone to work for Him according to his several ability. Man’s activity is not to be repressed,
          but sanctiﬁed and rightly <nobr>directed.—Manuscript</nobr> 27, January 22, 1907„ “The New England
          Sanitarium.”</p>
