      <p><strong>Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the ﬁeld? or shall the cold ﬂowing
          waters that come from another place be forsaken? Jeremiah 18:14.</strong></p>
      <p>We do not want to drink of the turbid streams of the valley. We do not want the corrupted sophistry of
          inﬁdelity. Because many are so ready to give in to doubt and questioning, inﬁdels are made bold. God help us
          that we may drink of the pure streams that ﬂow from beneath the throne of God. We can drink, and continue to
          drink. And, if you thirst for knowledge, there is plenty of it here....</p>
      <p>Many think themselves wonderfully wise in understanding the sentiments of inﬁdel writers, but they will ﬁnd
          that they are building upon a sandy foundation. They are not building upon the solid Rock. The storm of
          persecution, the storm of trial comes, and sweeps that foundation away, and they have nothing upon which to
          stand. What we want is to rivet our souls to the Eternal Rock....</p>
      <p>Brother [Alfred S.] Hutchins was at one time riding in Vermont and he met a lawyer. “Well,” said the lawyer, “I
          understand that you are a <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventist.” “Yes.” “Well,” said he, “you are nothing but
          little men.” “Yes, we know that,” said Brother Hutchins, “but we are handling mighty subjects. It is by the
          study of these mighty subjects that we are trying to get truth before the people.” This is what we
          <nobr>want—the</nobr> mighty subjects that will make men wise unto salvation.</p>
      <p>Just as soon as you begin to think you are big men, and that you are so large that you can comprehend and pick
          out all that is precious in inﬁdel authors, and leave out all that is vile, then you are wise above that which
          is written.... The</p>
      <p>devil is right by your side, and the evil angels are there. The devil is a great deal smarter than you are, and
          you cannot see what he is driving at. He will so cunningly interweave his sentiments with the thoughts of
          these writers, that it will be impossible to distinguish the error which they contain....</p>
      <p>If you want to be counted a wise man in God’s eyes, come right to the cross of Calvary, and get the inspiration
          that comes from it, and your name will be written as a wise man, who built his house upon the
          <nobr>Rock.—Manuscript</nobr> 8b, July 27, 1891„ “Talk to the Teachers.”</p>
