    <h1>Adorning the Gospel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more
          than my necessary food. Job 23:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Only those who read the Scriptures as the voice of God speaking to them are true learners. They tremble at the
          Word of God, for to them it is a living reality. They study, they search for the hidden treasure. They open
          their understanding and heart to receive, and they pray for heavenly grace, that they may obtain a preparation
          for the future, immortal life.</p>
      <p>As the heavenly torch is placed in his hand, man sees his own frailty, his inﬁrmity, his hopelessness in
          looking to himself for righteousness. In himself there is nothing that can recommend him to God. He prays for
          the Holy Spirit, the representative of Christ, to be his constant guide, to lead him into all truth....</p>
      <p>A bare assent to the truth is not Bible religion.... There are many Christians</p>
      <p>whose hearts are encased in a <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> armor that the arrow of the Lord, barbed and true,
          aimed by angel hands, would fail to pierce. The truth glides off, and the soul is not wounded. Man must ﬁrst
          seek God for himself, then the Holy Spirit will take the precious truth, far above the price of rubies, as it
          falls from the lips of Jesus, and convey it, a living power, to the obedient heart. The truth, received in the
          heart becomes a quickening power, awakening every faculty. It is a divine inﬂuence that touches the heart and
          creates the heavenly music that ﬂows forth from the lips in pure thanksgiving and praise.</p>
      <p>O what can I say in order to awaken the minds of those who profess to believe the truth, that they may adorn
          the gospel by a faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul. Christ bids you look to Him as the Illuminator
          of your darkened souls....</p>
      <p>The curiosity of men has led them to seek for the tree of knowledge; and often they think they are plucking
          fruit most essential, when, like Solomon’s research, they ﬁnd it altogether vanity and nothingness in
          comparison with that science of true holiness which will open to them the gates of the city of God....</p>
      <p>Every human agent must see that the great and important work for him in this life is to receive the divine
          likeness, to prepare a character for the future life. He must appropriate the heavenly truths to his special
          use in practical <nobr>life.—Manuscript</nobr> 67, June 9, 1898„ “Search the Scriptures.”</p>
