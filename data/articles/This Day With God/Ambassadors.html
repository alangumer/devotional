      <p><strong>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s
          stead, be ye reconciled to God. 2 Corinthians 5:20.</strong></p>
      <p>In the plan of restoring in men the divine image, it was provided that the Holy Spirit should move upon human
          minds, and be as the presence of Christ, a molding agency upon human character. Receiving the truth, men
          become also recipients of the grace of Christ, and devote their sanctiﬁed human ability to the work in which
          Christ was <nobr>engaged—men</nobr> become laborers together with God. It is to make men agents for God, that
          divine truth is brought home to their understanding. But I would inquire of the church, Have you answered this
          purpose? Have you fulﬁlled the design of God in diffusing the light of divine truth, in scattering abroad the
          precious jewels of truth?</p>
      <p>What must be the thoughts of the angels of God as they look upon the church of Christ, and see how slow is the
          action of those who profess to be the followers of Christ, to impart the light of truth to the world which
          lies in moral darkness? Heavenly intelligences know that the cross is the great center of attraction. They
          know that it is through the cross that fallen man is to receive the atonement, and to be brought into unity
          with God.</p>
      <p>The councils of heaven are looking upon you who claim to have accepted Christ as your personal Saviour, to see
          you make known the salvation of God to those who sit in darkness. They are looking to see you making known the
          signiﬁcance of the dispensation of the Holy Spirit; how that through the working of this divine agency the
          minds of men, corrupted and deﬁled by sin, may become disenchanted with the lies and presentations of Satan,
          and turn to Christ as their only hope, their personal Saviour.</p>
      <p>Christ says: “I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit
          should remain” (John 15:16). As Christ’s ambassador, I would entreat of all who read these lines to take heed
          while it is called today. “If ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts” (Hebrews 3:15; 4:7). Without
          waiting a moment, inquire, What am I to Christ? and what is Christ to me? What is my work? What is the
          character of the fruit I <nobr>bear?—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 12, 1895.</p>
