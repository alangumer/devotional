      <p><strong>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. Proverbs 4:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Without thorough puriﬁcation of the life, without meekness and humbleness of mind, the professing followers of
          Christ can not honor Him before the world. If the graces of Christ are not revealed in their lives, they can
          never be admitted to the heavenly mansions He has gone to prepare for those that love Him and keep His
          commandments.</p>
      <p>There are among our church members many who, while professing to walk in the ways of the Lord, are bringing
          into their profession the ways and habits of unconverted self, and these are spoiling their characters. So
          much that is frivolous is brought into the home and church life, that the Spirit of Christ is grieved. There
          are entire families among us who, unless they arouse from their sleepy indifference, will be lost; for they
          are not converted daily; they do not understand the divine science of true godliness; and therefore they are
          not vessels that the Master can use. They have allowed Satan to have the guidance and control of their words
          and actions, and they do not realize how much harm they have done to souls by their
          <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> They have hurt the heart of Christ by hurting those who are the purchase of His
          blood. I am bidden to say to these unconverted professors, “Dig deep, and lay your foundations solidly upon
          the Rock Christ Jesus. It is not enough for us to talk of the higher life. Our daily course of action is to be
          an interpretation to others of what the higher life means....</p>
      <p>The future eternal life of each individual depends, not on words, not on profession, but on earnest works. We
          need to make decided efforts in order to keep the heart with all diligence, while looking to Jesus as the
          Author and Finisher of our faith. We need to watch over an unruly tongue; we need to watch for opportunities
          to do good as Jesus did. Ministers of the gospel, preach Christ. Bring His heavenly grace into your lives and
          thoughts. Be truthful, and ever keep under the discipline of the Word of God. We must be saved in God’s
          appointed way. We must lean upon His counsel, and unite in His works. A penitent heart is always sensitive.
          Teach every individual who claims to be a child of God, that a <nobr>well-built</nobr> character will always
          be after the divine <nobr>pattern.—Letter</nobr> 78, March 5, 1907„ to Members of the Berkeley Churches.</p>
