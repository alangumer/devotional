      <p><strong>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
          word of truth. 2 Timothy 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Be careful how you interpret Scripture. Read it with a heart opened to the entrance of God’s Word, and it will
          express heaven’s light, giving understanding unto the simple. This does not mean the <nobr>weak-minded,</nobr>
          but those who do not stretch themselves beyond their measure and ability in trying to be original and
          independent in reaching after knowledge above that which constitutes true knowledge.</p>
      <p>All who handle the Word of God are engaged in a most solemn and sacred work; for in their research they are to
          receive light and a correct knowledge, that they may give to those who are ignorant. Education is the
          inculcation of ideas which are light and truth. Everyone who diligently and patiently searches the Scriptures
          that he may educate others, entering upon the work correctly and with an honest heart, laying aside his
          preconceived ideas, whatever they may have been, and his hereditary prejudices at the door of investigation,
          will gain true knowledge. But it is easy to put a false interpretation on Scripture, placing stress on
          passages, and assigning to them a meaning, which, at the ﬁrst investigation, may appear true, but which by
          further search, will be seen to be false. If the seeker after truth will compare Scripture with Scripture, he
          will ﬁnd the key that unlocks the treasure house and gives him a true understanding of the Word of God. Then
          he will see that his ﬁrst impressions would not bear investigation, and that continuing to believe them would
          be mixing falsehood with truth.</p>
      <p>The Psalmist David in his experience had many changes of mind. At times, as he obtained views of God’s will and
          ways, he was highly exalted. Then as he caught sight of the reverse of God’s mercy and changeless love,
          everything seemed to be shrouded in a cloud of darkness. But through the darkness he obtained a view of the
          attributes of God, which gave him conﬁdence and strengthened his faith.....</p>
      <p>As he wept and prayed, he obtained a clearer view of the character and attributes of God, being educated by
          heavenly agencies, and he decided that his ideas of God’s justice and severity were
          <nobr>exaggerated.—Manuscript</nobr> 4, February 4, 1896,.</p>
