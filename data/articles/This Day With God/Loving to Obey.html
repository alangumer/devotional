    <h1>Loving to Obey</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments,
          and abide in his love. John 15:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ attaches a weight of importance to the obedience of His people to the commandments of God. They are to
          have an intelligent knowledge of them, and bring them into their daily life. Man cannot keep the commandments
          of God, only as he is in Christ, and Christ in him. And it is not possible for him to be in Christ, having
          light on His commandments, while disregarding the least of them. By steadfast, willing obedience to His word,
          they evidence their love for the Sent of God.</p>
      <p>Not to keep the commandments of God is not to love Him. None will keep the law of God unless they love Him who
          is the only begotten of the Father. And nonetheless surely; if they love Him, they will express that love by
          obedience to Him. All who love Christ will be loved of the Father, and He will manifest Himself to them. In
          all their emergencies and perplexities they will have a helper in Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>That Christ should manifest Himself to them, and yet be invisible to the world, was a mystery to the disciples.
          They could not understand the words of Christ in their spiritual sense. They were thinking of the outward,
          visible manifestation. They could not take in the fact that they could have the presence of Christ with them,
          and yet He be unseen by the world. They did not understand the meaning of a spiritual manifestation.</p>
      <p>The great Teacher longed to give to the disciples all the encouragement and comfort possible, for they were to
          be sorely tried. But it was difﬁcult for them to comprehend His words. They had yet to learn that the inward
          spiritual life, all fragrant with the obedience of love, would give them the spiritual power they
          needed....</p>
      <p>The very image of God is to be impressed upon and reﬂected in humanity. The cold heart is to be quickened and
          glow with divine <nobr>love—a</nobr> love that beats in union with the love the Redeemer has evidenced for
          you....</p>
      <p>While no trials arise to disturb the people of God, the faith of that people will never be known, nor the
          strength of the anchor that holds the human barque in <nobr>safety.—Manuscript</nobr> 44, May 13, 1897„
          “Christ’s Representatives.”</p>
