      <p><strong>Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually. 1 Chronicles 16:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Now just now is our opportunity to open the windows of the soul heavenward and to close the windows earthward.
          Now is the time for every church member to say, I will close my heart to everything that would hinder my
          communion with Christ; I will open the windows of my soul heavenward that I may understand spiritual
          things.</p>
      <p>Believers need to talk with God in regard to their individual need of the Holy Spirit. The Word of God must be
          their assurance. All heaven is inviting us to receive the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness into our
          lives. If we will talk faith and hope and courage, our souls will be strengthened, and our hope and courage
          and faith will increase. Let us seek this great gift of the Sun of Righteousness, that it may shine forth in
          our lives to others. Let us seek the Lord that we may learn how to work His works in the world. This will make
          us successful missionaries, able to help others to a hopeful, courageous experience.</p>
      <p>In our service for the Master, let not the little things be overlooked. Every human being has a life web to
          weave, and if the pattern is complete and perfected at last, every thread of the pattern must be carefully and
          faithfully worked. The grace of Christ will enable us to weave skillfully and well. Day by day we are to put
          forth personal diligent effort to improve. Every day we are to use our Christian intelligence in the work of
          strengthening the weak, and encouraging the desponding. A great test is coming to every soul. Shall we not
          then work and watch and pray and praise the Lord? This will give us a most precious experience. Very much has
          been lost to many believers because they have neglected to seek the Lord with earnestness and with a faith
          that will not be denied.</p>
      <p>Words spoken and works performed in a simple, humble, encouraging way will inspire faith in other hearts. The
          Lord is soon to come, and the natural heart must be daily converted. We must learn to speak words in the
          meekness of Christ; our works and our spirit must testify that we are serving the <nobr>Lord.—Letter</nobr>
          54, March 7, 1909„ to Elder S. N. Haskell, a conference president.</p>
