    <h1>Heaven Begins Here</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought
          for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! Psalm 31:19.</strong></p>
      <p>As I write I have a deep sense of gratitude for the loving watchcare of our Saviour over us all. As I read the
          Word of God and kneel in prayer, I am so impressed with the goodness and mercy of God that I cannot offer my
          petition without weeping. My heart is subdued and broken as I think of my heavenly Father’s goodness and love.
          I hunger and thirst for more and still more of Jesus in this life. Christ was cruciﬁed for me, and shall I
          complain if I am cruciﬁed with Christ?</p>
      <p>I never felt a more earnest longing for righteousness than at the present time. In the waking hours of the
          night my prayer is, “Lord, teach Thy people how to seek and save the lost sheep.”</p>
      <p>We know not what is before us, and our only safety is in walking with Christ, our hand in His, our hearts ﬁlled
          with perfect trust. Has He not said, “Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he
          shall make peace with me” (Isaiah 27:5)? Let us keep close to the Saviour. Let us walk humbly with Him, ﬁlled
          with His meekness. Let self be hid with Him in God....</p>
      <p>My heart aches as I am shown how many there are who make self their idol. Christ has paid the redemption price
          for them. To Him belongs the service of all their powers. But their hearts are ﬁlled with
          <nobr>self-love,</nobr> and the desire for <nobr>self-adorning.</nobr> They give no thought to the words,
          “Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Mark
          8:34)....</p>
      <p>Among those to whom bitter disappointment will come at the day of ﬁnal reckoning will be some who have been
          outwardly religious, and who apparently have lived Christian lives. But self is woven into all they do. They
          pride themselves on their morality, their inﬂuence, their ability to stand in a higher position than others,
          and their knowledge of the truth, for they think that these will win for them the commendation of Christ.
          “Lord,” they plead, “we have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets” (Luke
          13:26). “Have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
          wonderful works? (Matthew <nobr>7:22).—Letter</nobr> 91, February 18, 1904„ to W. C. White.</p>
