    <h1>No Time for Strife</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
          righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justiﬁcation of life. Romans 5:18.</strong></p>
      <p>In much of the service professedly done for God, there is <nobr>self-emulation</nobr> and
          <nobr>self-exultation.</nobr> God hates pretense. When men and women receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
          they will confess their sins, and, pardon, which means justiﬁcation, will be given them. But the wisdom of the
          human agents who are not penitent, not humbled, is not to be depended on, for they are blinded in regard to
          the meaning of righteousness and sanctiﬁcation through the truth. When men are stripped of
          <nobr>self-righteousness,</nobr> they will see their spiritual poverty. Then they will approach that state of
          brotherly kindness that will show that they are in sympathy with Christ. They will be able to appreciate the
          high and elevated character of the work of Christian missions....</p>
      <p>Many are readily satisﬁed with offering the Lord triﬂing acts of service. Their Christianity is feeble. Christ
          gave Himself for sinners. With what anxiety for the salvation of souls we should be ﬁlled as we see human
          beings perishing in sin. These souls have been bought with a price.</p>
      <p>The death of the Son of God on Calvary’s cross is the measure of their value. Day by day they are deciding a
          question of life and death, deciding whether they will have eternal life or eternal destruction. And yet men
          and women professing to serve the Lord are content to occupy their time and attention with matters of little
          importance. They are content to be at variance with one another. If they were consecrated to the work of the
          Master, they would not be striving and contending like a family of unruly children. Every hand would be
          engaged in service. Everyone would be standing at his post of duty, working with heart and soul as
          missionaries of the cross of Christ. The Spirit of Christ would abide in the hearts of laborers, and works of
          righteousness would be wrought. The workers would carry with them into their service the sympathies and
          prayers of an awakened church. They would receive their orders from Christ, and would ﬁnd no time for
          contention or <nobr>strife.—Letter</nobr> 173, November 13, 1902„ to those assembled in council at Battle
          Creek.</p>
