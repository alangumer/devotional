    <h1>A Foretaste of Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for
          these words are true and faithful. Revelation 21:5.</strong></p>
      <p>In this morning’s meeting [a conference held in Battle Creek, Michigan], we were listening to the testimonies
          borne here, and as the last hymn was <nobr>sung—“When</nobr> shall we meet again, meet ne’er to
          <nobr>sever?”—I</nobr> almost forgot myself. My mind reached over to the other shore, to the time when there
          will be a grand meeting in the city of God around the great white throne, and the redeemed will be singing
          there of triumph, and of victory, and of praise to God and to the Lamb. Well now, it brought such a solemn,
          sweet feeling upon me; it softened my heart, and I could not prevent the tears from ﬂowing. Oh, what happiness
          we shall enjoy, gathered round about the throne, clothed in the white robes of the righteousness of Christ. No
          more sorrow, no more separation, but to dwell in peace, to dwell in happiness, to dwell in glory through the
          ceaseless ages of eternity. What a happy, happy company we may be!</p>
      <p>Now let us consider the same privileges here. When we consider the inﬁnite sacriﬁce of our Saviour that we
          might become children of God and members of the royal family, when we consider this exaltation, when we
          consider that all these privileges will be ours and may be ours every day, that we may have the privileges
          which belong to the sons and daughters of God, how can any one of us have any word of complaint? How can
          anyone utter one word of murmuring? How can it dwell in our hearts?</p>
      <p>We ought to be the most grateful people on the face of the earth. Our happiness is dependent on our faith in
          <nobr>God—our</nobr> conﬁdence in Him. And then when we think of what a hope we have, of what a faith we have,
          that it reaches right into the other world; when we know that it will continue unto the ceaseless ages of
          <nobr>eternity—I</nobr> want to know how you feel in regard to these pleas that have been presented to you
          tonight? ...</p>
      <p>If there is anything I can put into this work, that shall go. But there are many who are willing to give of
          their means, but they withhold themselves. Why is it we do not ﬁnd more who give themselves to this
          <nobr>work?—Manuscript</nobr> 5, November 20, 1883„ Sermon by Mrs. White at the closing morning meeting of the
          General Conference session, Battle Creek, Michigan.</p>
