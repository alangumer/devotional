    <h1>Without Spot</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; ...that he might present it to himself a
          glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without
          blemish. Ephesians <nobr>5:25-27.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>We bear the name of Christian. Let us be true to this name. To be a Christian means to be Christlike. It means
          to follow Christ in <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> bearing aloft His banner of love, honoring Him by unselﬁsh words
          and deeds. In the life of the true Christian there is nothing of <nobr>self—self</nobr> is dead. There was no
          selﬁshness in the life that Christ lived while on this earth. Bearing our nature, He lived a life wholly
          devoted to the good of others....</p>
      <p>In word and deed Christ’s followers are to be pure and true. In this <nobr>world—a</nobr> world of iniquity and
          <nobr>corruption—Christians</nobr> are to reveal the attributes of Christ. All they do and say is to be free
          from selﬁshness. Christ desires to present them to the Father “without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,”
          puriﬁed through His grace, bearing His likeness.</p>
      <p>In His great love, Christ surrendered Himself for us. He gave Himself for us to meet the necessities of the
          striving, struggling soul. We are to surrender ourselves to Him. When this surrender is entire, Christ can
          ﬁnish the work He began for us by the surrender of Himself. Then He can bring to us complete restoration.</p>
      <p>Christ gave Himself for the redemption of the race, that all who believe in Him may have everlasting life.
          Those who appreciate this great sacriﬁce receive from the Saviour that most precious of all
          <nobr>gifts—a</nobr> clean heart. They gain an experience that is more valuable than gold or silver or
          precious stones. They sit together in heavenly places in Christ, enjoying in communion with Him the joy and
          peace that He alone can give. They love Him with heart and mind and soul and strength, realizing that they are
          His <nobr>blood-bought</nobr> heritage. Their spiritual eyesight is not dimmed by worldly policy or worldly
          aims. They are one with Christ as He is one with the Father.</p>
      <p>Think you not that Christ values those who live wholly for Him? Think you not that He visits those who, like
          the beloved John, are for His sake in hard and trying places? He ﬁnds His faithful ones, and holds communion
          with them, encouraging and strengthening <nobr>them.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 30, 1907.</p>
