    <h1>Achieving Through Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up,
          and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctiﬁed. Acts 20:32.</strong></p>
      <p>The knowledge of the way of the Lord is increasing, and will continue to increase. Heresy and superstition are
          clothing the world in the sackcloth garments of rebellion and transgression. Literature and cheap ﬁction of
          every order is circulated like the leaves of autumn, and the minds of thousands are so taken up with
          irreligious, cheap trash that there is no place in the mind for solid reading. The Word of God and all that
          would elevate man from his degradation is passed by with indifference.</p>
      <p>But the Word of God contains the truth, and all those who support the truth of God for this time are doing
          their work for time and for eternity. Those who bring the Word of God into mind and heart are distinctly
          taking their stand on the side of God and the universe of heaven. They will stand heart to heart and hand to
          hand in defense of the holy and the pure, that which will stand the test of ages. Those who support error by
          word and pen and voice, and by the oppression of those who are linked with the truth, are ranged upon the
          other side, with the ﬁrst great apostate and the evil men who are his agents. The Word declares of these that
          they shall “wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.” And on one of these two sides, men will labor
          to the end.</p>
      <p>All our powers belong to God. They are His by creation, and by redemption. God has given to every one His
          measure of power, and He expects each to put it forth on the side of truth. Thus it is to shine forth. The
          Christian is to stand with undivided interest on the Lord’s side. “Now abideth faith, hope, love.” Faith looks
          through discouraging difﬁculties, and lays hold of the unseen, even Omnipotence, therefore it cannot be
          bafﬂed. Faith, hope, and love are sisters, and their works blend perfectly to shine amid the moral darkness of
          the world. The children and the youth are to be instructed, the ignorant are to be taught by patient effort to
          know what is truth. It is to be given them line upon <nobr>line.—Manuscript</nobr> 46, May 2, 1897„ “The
          Entrance of Thy Word Giveth Light.”</p>
