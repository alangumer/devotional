    <h1>The Divine Substitute</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God
          in him. 2 Corinthians 5:21.</strong></p>
      <p>“He saved others; himself he cannot save” (Mark 15:31). It is because Christ would not save Himself that the
          sinner has any hope of pardon or favor with God. If, in His undertaking to save the sinner, Christ had failed
          or become discouraged, the last hope of every son and daughter of Adam would have been at an end. The entire
          life of Christ was one of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce;</nobr> and the reason that there
          are so few stalwart Christians is because of their <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> and <nobr>self-pleasing</nobr>
          in the place of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr></p>
      <p>Oh, what soul hunger and longing had Christ to save that which was lost! The body cruciﬁed upon the cross did
          not detract from His divinity, His power of God to save through the human sacriﬁce, all who would accept His
          righteousness. In dying upon the cross, He transferred the guilt from the person of the transgressor to that
          of the divine Substitute through faith in Him as his personal Redeemer. The sins of a guilty world, which in
          ﬁgure are represented as “red as crimson,” were imputed to the divine Surety....</p>
      <p>Divinity was doing its work while humanity was suffering from the hatred and revenge of a
          <nobr>God-hating</nobr> people, because Christ had acknowledged Himself the Son of God. He alone could respond
          to the poor suffering thief. He alone was free to undertake the suretyship of the guilty criminal. The dying
          Redeemer saw him to be far less guilty than the ones who had condemned Him to death, far less guilty than the
          priests, the scribes, and rulers who had taken an active part in demanding the death of the Son of God.</p>
      <p>What a faith had that dying thief upon the cross! He accepted Christ when apparently it was an utter
          impossibility that He should be the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world. In the prayer of the poor thief,
          there was a note different from that which was sounding on every side; it was a note of faith, and it reached
          to Christ. The faith of the dying man in Him was as sweetest music in the ears of Christ. The glad note of
          redemption and salvation was heard amid His dying agonies. God was gloriﬁed in and through His
          <nobr>Son.—Manuscript</nobr> 84a, August 15, 1897„ “Christ on the Cross.”</p>
