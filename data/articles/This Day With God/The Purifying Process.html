    <h1>The Purifying Process</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
          Hebrews 2:18.</strong></p>
      <p>I am awakened at twelve o’clock to write out the instruction that has been given me....</p>
      <p>The words were spoken, “I am the Light of the world. Kindle your soul’s light from the wisdom of human
          agencies, and your light will go out in darkness. Seek My wisdom, and you will be guided by unerring counsel.
          This guidance it is the privilege of every child of God to have. Ask, and ye shall receive; but ask in faith
          believing. Ask for that which is in accordance with the Word of God. Believing, ye shall receive.”</p>
      <p>Christ is the source of our strength. Let us study His teachings. In giving His only begotten Son to live in
          our world and to be subject to temptation that He might teach us how to overcome, the Father has made ample
          provision that we should not be taken captive by the enemy. Meeting the fallen foe, Christ overcame in behalf
          of humanity. He was tempted in all points like as we are, but He resisted in the strength of divinity, that He
          might be able to succor us when we are tempted.</p>
      <p>Becoming partakers of His divine nature, we are to learn to discern the temptations of Satan, and, in the
          strength of His grace, overcome the corruptions that are in the world through lust. He who was once a sinful
          human being may be reﬁned and puriﬁed through the imparted merits of Christ, and stand before his fellow men
          as a laborer together with God. To the earnest seeker after God, the divine nature will surely be imparted,
          the compassion of Christ will certainly be vouchsafed....</p>
      <p>Satan is working with all his ingenuity to sidetrack souls. What shall we do? Let us believe that the Lord is
          willing to raise up and strengthen the weak.</p>
      <p>You will ﬁnd your greatest strength in dwelling upon that which is spiritual. Let the sanctiﬁcation of the
          truth of the Word of God be revealed in your life. Let this agency reﬁne and ennoble the soul. The Lord would
          have His ministering servants walk humbly before Him. “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
          and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light”
          (Matthew 11:29, <nobr>30).—Letter</nobr> 166, May 22, 1908„ to W. W. Prescott, editor of the Review and
          Herald.</p>
