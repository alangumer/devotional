    <h1>Study to Be Approved</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in
          meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
          acknowledging of the truth. 2 Timothy 2:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>Every one engaging in the work needs these words framed and hung in memory’s hall: “We are labourers together
          with God” (1 Corinthians 3:9). Then there will not be so many decided failures in the efforts made to win
          souls to Jesus Christ. There is need of bringing them to the foundation, and building them into a ﬁrm
          structure, that will abide the ﬁres of the last great day. The people cannot be reached, and their hearts
          broken, except by God’s divine power (see 1 Corinthians <nobr>3:9-15)....</nobr></p>
      <p>Let the men who are engaged in the solemn work of bearing the last message to the world, heed the exhortation
          of Paul, “Preach the Word.” Not the science of phrenology, or the productions from human speculations, but
          listen to the words of inspiration addressed to Timothy: “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord
          Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be
          instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time
          will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
          teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto
          fables” (2 Timothy <nobr>4:1-4)....</nobr></p>
      <p>The minister of the gospel is never exhorted to strive to be a smart preacher, a popular speaker, but is
          commanded to “study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
          dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness”
          (chap. 2:15, 16). Will every messenger of God give heed to these words? We are laborers together with God, and
          if those who accept the responsibility of holding forth the Word of life to others do not daily yoke up with
          Christ, and lift His burdens, and learn of Jesus day by day; it were better for them to seek some other
          <nobr>employment.—Manuscript</nobr> 29, April 20, 1893„ “Laborers to Learn Lessons at the Foot of the
          Cross.”</p>
