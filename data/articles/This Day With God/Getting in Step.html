    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing,
          and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the
          same judgment. 1 Corinthians 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Last night I seemed to be standing before a large number of people who were not united. One would stand back
          while another desired to go forward. They were not standing in unity one with another. I saw a heavenly being
          appear before them, and heard him say: “Come into line! No one is ﬁghting a battle on his own charges. The
          Master of assemblies says, Come into line!”</p>
      <p>After this, I did not go to sleep again. I wondered whether in this meeting our brethren were coming into line.
          It is often very difﬁcult for a large group of workers to come into full harmony one with another; but every
          one is to come into line, and ﬁll his appointed place. May God help His servants to do this, is my
          prayer.</p>
      <p>Although some may have followed their own way for a time, it is possible for them to return, and get into line.
          The Lord sees that it is not best for His children to be allowed to do as they please, and refuse to unite
          with their brethren who view matters somewhat differently from the way in which they may view them.</p>
      <p>There are some who do not readily respond to the invitation to forsake their own way, and come into harmony
          with God’s way. They prefer to follow a way of their own choosing. Those who wish to do so, have the privilege
          of continuing to walk in their own unconsecrated way, but the end of that way is sorrow and destruction.</p>
      <p>The Lord has men of His appointment whom He will use in His work so long as they allow themselves to be used in
          accordance with His good pleasure. He can never use any one who is seeking to humble someone else. Humble
          yourselves, brethren. When you do this, it is possible for holy angels to communicate with you, and place you
          on vantage ground. Then your experience, instead of being faulty, will be ﬁlled with happiness. Seek to relate
          yourselves in harmony with God’s leadings, and then you will be susceptible to the movings of His Holy
          Spirit.</p>
      <p>The Lord is coming. The end of all things is at hand. There remains but little time in which to develop
          <nobr>character.—Manuscript</nobr> 47, January 27, 1910„ “Come Into Line.”</p>
