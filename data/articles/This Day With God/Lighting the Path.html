    <h1>Lighting the Path</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Do all things without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God
          without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the
          world. Philippians 2:14, 15, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Christians must be <nobr>light-givers,</nobr> holding forth the words of life. They are exhorted by the apostle
          to the highest achievements of piety. The world will not be convinced by what the pulpit teaches, but by what
          the church lives. The path to heaven is dark or bright, just in proportion as the church gives forth a clear
          and strong, or doubtful, ﬁtful light. The preacher in the desk announces the theory of the gospel, but the
          practical piety of the church demonstrates the power of truth, showing its real value.</p>
      <p>The gospel is a system of practical truths destined to work great changes in human character. If it does not
          work the transformation in life, in habits, and practice, it is no truth to those who claim to believe it. Man
          must be sanctiﬁed through the truth. And said Jesus, “Thy word is truth” (John 17:17). Unless the truth of God
          shall lift up man out of his depravity, his intemperate and proﬂigate habits, and make him reﬂect the image of
          God, he is lost.</p>
      <p>Your lives, my brethren and sisters, must be after a different model than they have hitherto been, and
          constitute the demonstration in the sight of heaven and earth that you are lights in the world, holding forth
          the words of life. The piety of the members of the church constitutes the world’s standard of the gospel. Then
          let every church member in St. Clare do his duty well; for you are laborers together with God. Let your
          example be in harmony with the great pattern.</p>
      <p>Do all things without murmurings and disputings, without grumbling, without envy. Do not repeat or believe the
          old slander that the man of one talent brought against God, “I feared thee, because thou art an austere man:
          thou takest up that thou layest not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow” (Luke 19:21). This parable
          represented the many professors of religion who gauged their piety to reach the lowest standard possible, and
          escape perdition.</p>
      <p>There is need of your being diligent, prayerful students of the Bible, then you will see the exalted standard,
          and aim to reach <nobr>it.—Letter</nobr> 14, March 13, 1885„ to the church at St. Clare, Nevada.</p>
