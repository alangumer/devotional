      <p><strong>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
          therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
          Ghost. Matthew 28:18, 19.</strong></p>
      <p>To Christ, and to Christ alone, is given the right of authority over all things. Those who put their trust in
          Him, and will hold fast the profession of their faith ﬁrm unto the end, will be protected. As Christ’s
          disciples, as laborers together with Him, there must be united action among all the laborers. Some are
          converted to the truth in one way, others are best reached by a different method. So the laborers will act,
          some in one line, others in another, but all may blend unitedly. To every man is given his work.</p>
      <p>Those who criticize their fellow workers open a door through which the enemy will enter. What can be more sad
          than to see brother working against brother, expressing suspicion and doubts of the other’s sincerity? There
          is room enough for all to use their <nobr>God-given</nobr> talents. All are laboring with the one object of
          inspiring belief in the words of inspiration. Then let every one so order his speech and work that he may be
          in harmony with those who are laboring to the same end as he himself....</p>
      <p>Let those who are entrusted with the work of teaching the Word of God be sure that they are under the control
          of Him who has declared, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth” (Matthew 28:18). His commission
          to His disciples includes the words, “Teaching them [all nations] to observe all things whatsoever I have
          commanded you” (Verse 20). No man is authorized to set up his own mind as the standard to which he may compel
          others to conform....</p>
      <p>The glorious gospel, God’s message of redeeming love, must be brought to the people, and that love is to be
          revealed in the hearts of the laborers. The theme of saving grace is an antidote for a harsh spirit. The love
          of Christ in the heart will be expressed in earnest work for the salvation of sinners....</p>
      <p>Let the gospel be presented as the word of God for life and salvation.... The</p>
      <p>gospel will be commended by the revelation of a spirit that works by love. “How beautiful upon the mountains
          are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace” (Isaiah <nobr>52:7).—Letter</nobr> 318,
          October 15, 1906„ to the brethren and sisters in Nashville and in Madison.</p>
