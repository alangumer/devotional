      <p><strong>And he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to
          sleep. And he dreamed. Genesis 28:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>Jacob was afﬂicted because he had made a mistake in his life. He was cast down to the very depths. Alone,
          weary, dispirited, tortured by the recollections of his past errors, and overwhelmed with apprehensions for
          the future, he laid him down to rest, his head pillowed upon a stone. Had Jacob’s conscience been clear, his
          heart would have been strong in God. But he knew his present perplexities, his fears and trials, were in
          consequence of his sins. This reﬂection is what embittered his life. Jacob was repentant, yet he did not feel
          easy under the wrong he had done. Through tribulation and through physical and mental suffering he could only
          have hope to ﬁnd his way again to the favor of God.</p>
      <p>He lay down in sadness, with a heavy heart, repenting and yet fearing. He expected that new trials would meet
          him on the morrow as he pursued his weary way.</p>
      <p>There was no friend nigh to speak a comforting word to Jacob, no one to tell him he had in his sincere
          repentance done what he could. But God’s eye was upon His servant. He sent His angels to reveal to him a
          ladder of brightness reaching from the earth to the highest heavens, and the angels of God ascending and
          descending upon this glorious ladder, which showed Jacob the connection and intercourse constantly going on
          between the two worlds. When Jacob awoke his difﬁculties had not vanished entirely, but he had such conﬁdence
          in God that he was comforted. In humble gratitude of heart he adores his Saviour and especially honors even
          his stony pillow.</p>
      <p>Oh, the wonderful condescension of God! He is ever ready to meet us, even in our inﬁrmities, and to encourage
          us by His presence, when we have done all on our part to make an entire surrender to Him. Heaven is open to
          man. God will be entreated to do these things for us. The future may seem dark before you, but God
          lives....</p>
      <p>Break down every barrier and let the Saviour into your heart. Let self die. Surrender your will and die to self
          now, just now, and leave God to make your way for <nobr>you.—Letter</nobr> 29, November 10, 1879„ to Edson
          White.</p>
