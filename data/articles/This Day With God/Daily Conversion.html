    <h1>Daily Conversion</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A false balance is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight. Proverbs
          11:1.</strong></p>
      <p>We need to experience daily a reconversion. If you have taken advantage in your business dealings, which the
          Lord calls injustice, this must be adjusted before you can be honest and righteous in the sight of God. These
          things need to be corrected by our people everywhere.... When you take up this work of</p>
      <p>readjustment and getting right with God, angels of heaven will cooperate with you, giving you discernment to
          see where you have viewed matters in a wrong light.</p>
      <p>Christ and angels are looking upon your work. They are measuring every action. Let your life represent the meek
          and lowly Jesus. Strive to do as Christ would do were He in your place. Let there be no disagreement between
          your measurement of strict integrity and the divine measure. True, pure principles must govern the life of
          every soul that shall be pronounced just and righteous in the day of God.</p>
      <p>There are many transactions in the business world that the worldling regards as just and honest, but which God
          condemns. Men lay plans which they regard as right plans, but which do not accord with the true, unselﬁsh
          principles that Christ has laid down in His Word.... But the approval of the world will never</p>
      <p>make an unjust action just, and wrong will stand as wrong before the heavenly universe until it is repented of
          and put away.</p>
      <p>The Lord cannot bless the men who corrupt themselves by unjust business dealings, either with their brethren or
          with worldlings. And those who do such things lose their spirituality; they grow cold and formal and selﬁsh.
          They gloss over their past mistakes by theories of their own invention that are opposed to the principles of
          the Word of God.</p>
      <p>The principle which should characterize every business dealing is clearly laid down by Christ. “All things
          whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets”
          (Matthew 7:12)....</p>
      <p>The folly, the evil surmising, the uplifting of self, which destroy the fervent zeal of the soul will be put
          away, and the true believers will be humble of heart, and earnest in their labors for the perishing
          <nobr>souls.—Letter</nobr> 164, November 30, 1909„ to the workers in Washington and Mountain View.</p>
