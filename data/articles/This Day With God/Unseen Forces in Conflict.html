    <h1>Unseen Forces in Conﬂict</h1>

      <p><strong>He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him....
          He is a liar, and the father of it. John</strong></p>
      <p>8:44.</p>
      <p>We are all to understand that there is a fallen angel who was once next to Christ in honor among the heavenly
          host. His work of deception was done in so great secrecy that the angels in less exalted positions supposed
          that he was the Ruler of heaven. Satan made the representation that all wrong insinuations existing in heaven
          originated among the angels, while he himself had made suggestions which would never have been entertained by
          the angels, had he not created them. He artfully presented these things to God, as having come from the
          angels, while they all originated with Satan himself....</p>
      <p>Because he was not able to insinuate his deceptions upon Christ, he determined to undermine Him by false
          statements and reports. War in heaven was the result, and Satan was expelled. He became Christ’s most deadly
          foe. His constant effort was to counteract, in every possible way, His great work of saving souls.</p>
      <p>Christ had worked in the heavenly courts to convince Satan of his terrible error, till at last the evil one and
          his sympathizers were found in open rebellion against God Himself. Then he claimed a right to take a position
          above Christ as covering cherub. Expelled from heaven, he came to this earth, determined to work against
          Christ. He is in no danger of losing the angels that he deceived. He has them under his banner, enlisted to
          ﬁght against the Son of God.</p>
      <p>When Christ came to this world, Satan was constantly on His track, striving to make His work of no avail. When
          Christ was healing the sick and afﬂicted, Satan was on the ground, making His work of saving souls as hard as
          possible....</p>
      <p>When souls, convicted, and aroused to their danger, began to inquire, “What shall I do that I may have eternal
          life?” Satan was present, to stir up the minds of the priests and rulers to oppose the Saviour’s work, to
          hedge up His way. But Christ ever proved Himself superior to Satan. Rebuking the Satanic agencies, He set free
          the poor souls who were bound by his chains, and bade them go <nobr>free.—Letter</nobr> 292, September 4,
          1906„ to Dr. and Mrs. D. H. Kress, at the Sydney Sanitarium in Australia.</p>
