    <h1>Lip Service Religion</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afﬂicted soul; then shall thy light rise in
          obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day. Isaiah 58:10.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a spurious experience that is prevailing now everywhere in regard to the love of
          <nobr>Jesus—that</nobr> we must dwell on the love of Jesus, that faith in Jesus is all we
          <nobr>need—but</nobr> these souls must be instructed that the love of Jesus in the heart will lead to humility
          of life and obedience to all His commandments. “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
          is a liar, and the truth is not in him” (1 John 2:4). The love of Jesus that goes no farther than the lips
          will not save any soul, but be a great <nobr>delusion.—Manuscript</nobr> 26, October 17, 1885„ “First Visit to
          Sweden, diary.”</p>
      <p>Some who claim to love Jesus are deceivers and all their religion is lip service. It does not transform the
          character. It does not reveal the inward working of grace. They do not show that they have ever learned in
          Christ’s school the lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart. They do not show by life or character that
          they are wearing Christ’s yoke or lifting Christ’s burdens. They are not reaching the standard given them in
          God’s Word, but a human standard. Their life is not pure like Christ’s life. They are not being reﬁned and
          ennobled by His Spirit. The way of truth they have not known, and they are of that number who will say, “Lord,
          Lord, open unto us. We have taught in the streets. We have done many wonderful works.” But Christ will say of
          them, “I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity” (Matthew <nobr>7:23).—Ibid.</nobr></p>
      <p>Those who reject the truth of the Bible do it under a pretense of loving Jesus. Those who love Jesus will
          reveal that love by being obedient children. They will be doers of the Word and not hearers only. They will
          not be continually pleading, “All that we have to do is to believe in Jesus.” This is true in the fullest
          sense, but they do not comprehend, they do not take it in its fullest sense. To believe in Jesus is to take
          Him as your Redeemer, as your Pattern. All who love Jesus must follow His example. They must connect
          themselves with Jesus as closely as the branch is connected with the living vine. They are abiding in Jesus
          and Jesus is abiding in them and they are doers of His Word, partakers of His divine
          <nobr>nature.—Ibid.</nobr></p>
