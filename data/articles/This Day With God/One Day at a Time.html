      <p><strong>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Psalm
          62:8.</strong></p>
      <p>What a privilege that we sinful mortals have the privilege of speaking with God. In the closet, when walking
          the streets, when engaged in labor, our hearts can be ascending to God for counsel, our souls drawn out after
          God, a breath from heaven. All these soul longings, God will hear. All our troubles we may take to God. His
          hand of inﬁnite love is moved to supply our needs. How thankful I am that we have only one day to live at a
          time. One day to keep our souls stayed upon, one day to watch, one day to progress in the spiritual life and
          thus our days may be fruitful, precious days to us.</p>
      <p>We have a soldier’s duty to perform, victories to gain, for we must not be ignorant of Satan’s devices. We pray
          and then watch lest Satan shall steal upon us and make us forget our need of prayer, our need of vigilance and
          watching thereunto.</p>
      <p>In the Christian warfare, unless there is a sharp eye on the adversary and a sharp eye on ourselves, we shall
          be led into Satan’s snare. Our security depends on the state of our heart. God help us to take heed to
          ourselves or we shall certainly lose heaven. Little departures from right, little indulgences, seem a triﬂing
          thing at present, but Satan will lead us on a track that will separate us from righteousness and from God. We
          want not our ways but God’s ways. We want to strive with all the powers of being to bruise Satan under our
          feet and be sure that we are right with God, that we have a clear title to our immortal inheritance.</p>
      <p>We may have to be stripped of everything before we will come in humble submission to be led, guided, and
          controlled by the will of God. We want humble, trusting, childlike conﬁdence, meekness, lowliness, no
          <nobr>self-conﬁdence,</nobr> but humble trust in Jesus. What traits of character are we cultivating? That
          which will be enduring as eternity? Is our time spent in busy activity, but our souls unblessed and our
          heavenly Father not gloriﬁed? Eternal life is worth a lifelong, persevering, untiring effort and we cannot
          afford to make haphazard work. When our soul’s highest interest is concerned, we cannot afford to keep Jesus
          in the outer courts, away from our <nobr>souls.—Letter</nobr> 81, January 19, 1887„ to Edson and Emma
          White.</p>
