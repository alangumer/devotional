    <h1>Anywhere, Lord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
          content. Philippians 4:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The thought has impressed itself upon my mind that as I have no change in my physical health it is not best to
          relate my pains or my hours of sleeplessness at night. So day after day passes and my experience is the same.
          My body is full of rheumatic pains. I have no appetite or pleasure in eating, and when sitting a short time it
          is a most painful process to rise. My limbs refuse to obey my will, and if I move them at all I suffer much
          pain.</p>
      <p>I have many thoughts that I am not sent to this country [Australia] of the Lord. I feel at times an assurance
          that the Lord’s will was for me to remain in California, in my own home, and write as I should be able to
          write upon the life of Christ. Of one thing I am <nobr>certain—that</nobr> the people need help in this
          country. And I feared it might be selﬁshness in me, or seeking my ease, to refuse to go to Australia.</p>
      <p>During my life I have tried to do that which was opposed to my inclination because Christ our Pattern lived not
          to please Himself. Repeatedly, at large expense, I have thought I had secured a place of retirement and rest,
          where I could write out the life of Christ, when some earnest call would come from somewhere where help was
          needed, and request would be made for me to bear my testimony among the churches. I dared not say Nay. I at
          once responded that I would do according to the strength given me of God. After this work was ﬁnished in my
          feebleness, then other duties in Battle Creek called for labor which required me to carry the burden night and
          day, being much in prayer in the hours of the night when I could not sleep.</p>
      <p>When I journeyed to California I verily believed I could remain there through the winter, but many expressed
          their minds that now was the time to go to Australia. I dared not settle down, but went, according to the
          voice and light of my brethren. Now when I came to Australia the burden did come upon me and I labored just as
          I had hitherto <nobr>done.—Manuscript</nobr> 29, February 22, 1892„ diary, written in Melbourne,
          Australia.</p>
