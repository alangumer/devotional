    <h1>A Thankful Heart</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
          Ephesians 5:20.</strong></p>
      <p>It would please the Lord if you would make an effort to forget yourself. Begin to thank the Lord for your home
          and your pleasant surroundings, and the many temporal blessings He gives you. By returning thanks to the Lord
          for His goodness, you can do something for the One who has done everything for you. Contemplate the depths of
          the compassion that the Saviour felt for you. For you He gave His life, suffering the cruel death of the
          cross. Can you not praise the Lord for this? If you will hide your life in Christ, He will receive you.</p>
      <p>If you will show that you have a working faith, by trying every day to exercise your will power, your faculties
          will gain strength. I know this by experience. I remember in my own case how my faculties recovered their
          pliability as I tried to exercise them. Will you try to move about, and be cheerful in spirit? Put your trust
          in Jesus. Have faith in Him, and be pliant in His hands. You will receive great blessing by making a change in
          your habits....</p>
      <p>For eleven months after going to Australia, I suffered from inﬂammatory rheumatism. I was unable to lift my
          feet from the ﬂoor without suffering great pain....</p>
      <p>During those eleven months of suffering ...I would not give up. My right arm, from the elbow down, was whole,
          so that I could use the pen, and I wrote <nobr>twenty-ﬁve</nobr> hundred pages of letter paper for
          publication. During this period, I had the most terrible suffering of my life....</p>
      <p>But to all this there is a cheerful side. My Saviour seemed to be close beside me. I felt His sacred presence
          in my heart, and I was so thankful. These months of suffering were the happiest months of my life, because of
          the companionship of my Saviour.... His love ﬁlled my heart. All through my sickness, His love,</p>
      <p>His tender compassion, was my comfort....</p>
      <p>Look unto Jesus, your pitying, loving Saviour. If you cast your helpless soul on Christ, He will bring joy and
          peace to your soul. He will be your crown of rejoicing, your exceeding great <nobr>reward.—Letter</nobr> 34,
          February 6, 1907„ to the wife of a conference administrator in Australia.</p>
