    <h1>The Mystery of Spiritual Growth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
          unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephesians 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>If the followers of Christ were but earnest seekers after wisdom, they would be led into rich ﬁelds of truth,
          as yet wholly unknown to them. He who will give himself to God as fully as did Moses, will be guided by the
          divine hand as verily as was the great leader of Israel. He may be lowly and apparently ungifted; yet if with
          a loving, trusting heart he obeys every intimation of God’s will, his powers will be puriﬁed, ennobled,
          energized, and his capabilities will be increased. As he treasures the lessons of divine wisdom, a sacred
          commission will be entrusted to him; he will be enabled to make his life an honor to God and a blessing to the
          world....</p>
      <p>Today many are as ignorant of the Holy Spirit’s work upon the heart as were those believers in Ephesus (see
          Acts <nobr>19:1-6);</nobr> yet no truth is more clearly taught in the Word of God. Prophets and apostles have
          dwelt upon this theme. Christ Himself calls our attention to the growth of the vegetable world as an
          illustration of the agency of His Spirit in sustaining spiritual life. The sap of the vine, ascending from the
          root, is diffused to the branches, sustaining growth and producing blossoms and fruit. So the
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Saviour, pervades the soul, renews the
          motives and affections, and brings even the thoughts into obedience to the will of God, enabling the receiver
          to bear the precious fruit of holy deeds.</p>
      <p>The Author of this spiritual life is unseen, and the exact method by which that life is imparted and sustained,
          is beyond the power of human philosophy to explain. Yet the operations of the Spirit are always in harmony
          with the written Word. As in the natural, so in the spiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by
          moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed
          within our reach. So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied.
          If the follower of Christ would grow up “unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
          Christ” (Ephesians 4:13), he must eat of the bread of life, and drink of the water of
          <nobr>salvation.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August 31, 1911.</p>
