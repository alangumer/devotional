    <h1>The Measure of Christianity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is
          thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Matthew
          5:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who are placed in positions of trust must have the authority of action, but they are never to use this
          authority as a power to refuse help to the needy and helpless. It is never to be exercised to discourage or
          depress one struggling soul. Let those to whom have been given positions of inﬂuence ever remember that God
          desires them to carry out the mind of Christ....</p>
      <p>True godliness is measured by the work done. Profession is nothing; position is nothing; a character like the
          character of Christ is the evidence we are to bear that God has sent His Son into the world. Those who profess
          to be Christians, yet do not act as Christ would were He in their place, greatly injure the cause of God. They
          misrepresent their Saviour, and are standing under false colors.</p>
      <p>The true disciple, in whose heart Christ abides, shows forth to the world Christ’s love for humanity. He is
          God’s helping hand. The glow of spiritual health thrills his whole being as he receives from the Saviour grace
          to give to others....</p>
      <p>Pure and undeﬁled religion is not a sentiment, but a doing of works of love and mercy. This religion is
          necessary to health and happiness. It enters the polluted <nobr>soul-temple,</nobr> and with a scourge drives
          out the sinful intruder. Taking the throne, it consecrates all by its presence, illuminating the heart with
          the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. It opens the windows of the soul heavenward, letting in the
          sunshine of God’s love. With it comes serenity and composure. Physical, mental, and moral strength increase,
          because the atmosphere of heaven, as a living, active agency, ﬁlls the soul....</p>
      <p>When Christians do not reveal Christ, of what value are they? Are they not like savorless salt, “good for
          nothing”? But when they reveal in their lives the saving properties of the truth, poor,
          <nobr>sin-hardened</nobr> souls are not left to perish in corruption. Good works are seen; for the living
          principles of righteousness cannot be hidden. The gospel acted is like salt which contains all its savor. It
          is powerful in the saving of <nobr>souls.—Letter</nobr> 7, January 17, 1901„ to “Brethren Who Occupy Positions
          of Trust.”</p>
