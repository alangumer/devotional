    <h1>Acceptable Ambition</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
          before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.
          Exodus 33:19.</strong></p>
      <p>In this representation the Lord desired to teach the lesson that He requires in His people purity of character,
          holiness of life. He desires to see revealed in them toward each other the attributes of mercy and loving
          kindness and longsuffering, that His people may demonstrate that “the law of the Lord is perfect, converting
          the soul” (Psalm 19:7). The Lord is ready to manifest Himself to us if our hearts are seeking and serving Him.
          It is ever His desire to impart the richest blessings to those who serve Him with a pure heart. Christ will be
          our teacher if we will open our hearts to His instruction and obey His voice....</p>
      <p>It is the Lord’s will that you should exert a wide inﬂuence for good. Have you resolved to be a decided
          Christian? Then fail not nor be discouraged. Let your work have an uplifting inﬂuence, that you may be a
          laborer together with God. The Lord would have us all glorify His name.</p>
      <p>Last night a heavy burden rested upon me in regard to the great work that is to be done. It is a work that
          calls for the exercise of all the capabilities that men possess. Will you not exercise your capabilities in a
          way that will bring you into perfect union with Jesus Christ? As parents and teachers we are to cooperate with
          the divine Teacher. We are to labor to restore to men and women the sense of moral obligation which has been
          lost. Let every parent now cooperate with the divine plan, and thus become laborers together with God.</p>
      <p>All our varied capabilities belong to God. He has bought us by the gift of His only begotten Son, and those who
          have a sense of their obligation to God will cooperate with the divine purpose. Those who carry
          responsibilities in this work of giving the third angel’s message to the world are to show a determined
          purpose to advance the work of God. Heart and soul and voice are to be consecrated to Him that they may reach
          the highest degree of <nobr>excellence—a</nobr> likeness to the character of God. Every faculty, every
          attribute with which the Lord has endowed us is to be employed for the uplifting of our fellow men. If we will
          do our best, working with unselﬁsh spirit, the Lord will accept our <nobr>service.—Letter</nobr> 50, March 3,
          1909„ to a physician in private practice.</p>
