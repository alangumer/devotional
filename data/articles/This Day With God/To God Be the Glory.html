    <h1>To God Be the Glory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let
          him be your servant. Matthew 20:26, 27.</strong></p>
      <p>No human being is to seat himself on the highest seat, accepting the praise of others, and forgetting that his
          treasures belong to God. God’s blessing is promised to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, but
          nothing is so offensive as to hunger and thirst after the praise of men.</p>
      <p>When the Lord weighs in the balances of the sanctuary the actions of those who have striven to be ﬁrst, when
          they see how He regards such strife they will bow low at His footstool, ashamed of their course of action. All
          cannot be ﬁrst, all cannot be masters. Walk humbly before God, acknowledging Him as your Master. It is a great
          misfortune to be unable to see in others higher excellencies and powers of greater usefulness than in
          yourself.</p>
      <p>If we will partake of the divine nature, God will ﬁt us to ﬁnd happiness in activity, and rest in wearing
          Christ’s yoke. Using aright the powers God has given us, praying, waiting, watching, and working, wearing
          Christ’s yoke and learning daily of Him to be meek and lowly of heart, will bring great joy into our
          lives.</p>
      <p>Were it not for God’s gracious gifts and blessings, we should be bankrupt for eternity. Then let no one sound
          his own praises, feeding upon his supposed wisdom. If his talents were of his own manufacture, there would be
          some consistency in <nobr>self-praise.</nobr> But man has nothing of his own. Let us not reveal our lack of
          true wisdom by exalting self. Let us bow low in humility at the feet of Him who has entrusted to us our
          talents. Let us use and improve these talents, handing principle and interest back to the Giver....</p>
      <p>As a sacred trust every talent is to be employed aright. Those whom God has made His stewards are to search the
          Scriptures earnestly, that they may communicate its truths to others, leading them to the path which has been
          cast up for the ransomed of the Lord. By precept and example we are to teach others that through the grace of
          Christ they may be obedient to all God’s commandments, and be clothed with the righteousness of Christ....
          “Blessed are they that do his</p>
      <p>commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city”
          (Revelation <nobr>22:14).—Manuscript</nobr> 88, July 10, 1898„ “The Parable of the Householder.”</p>
