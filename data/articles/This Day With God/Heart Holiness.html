    <h1>Heart Holiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>“But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I
          will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be
          my people.” Jeremiah 31:33, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>When the law of God is written in the heart it will be exhibited in a pure and holy life. The commandments of
          God are no dead letter. They are spirit and life, bringing the imaginations and even the thoughts into
          subjection to the will of Christ. The heart in which they are written will be kept with all diligence; for out
          of it are the issues of life. All who love Jesus and keep the commandments will seek to avoid the very
          appearance of evil; not because they are constrained thus to do, but because they are copying a pure model,
          and feel averse to everything contrary to the law written in their hearts. They will not feel
          <nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr> but their trust will be in God, who alone is able to keep them from sin and
          impurity. The atmosphere surrounding them is pure; they will not corrupt their own souls or the souls of
          others. It is their pleasure to deal justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before God.</p>
      <p>The danger that lies before those living in these last days, is the absence of pure religion, the absence of
          heart holiness. The converting power of God has not wrought in transforming their characters. They profess to
          believe sacred truths as did the Jewish nation; but in their failing to practice the truth, they are ignorant
          both of the Scriptures and the power of God. The power and inﬂuence of God’s law are around about, but not
          within the soul, renewing it in true holiness....</p>
      <p>God designs that the teacher of the Bible should in his character and home life be a specimen of the principles
          of the truth which he is teaching to his fellow men.</p>
      <p>What a man is, has a greater inﬂuence than what he says. The quiet, consistent, godly life is a living epistle,
          known and read of all men. A man may speak and write like an angel, but his practices may resemble a fallen
          ﬁend.... True character is not something shaped from without, or put on, but it is</p>
      <p>something radiating from within. If true goodness, purity, meekness, lowliness, and equity are dwelling in the
          heart, that fact will be reﬂected in the character; and such a character is full of <nobr>power.—The</nobr>
