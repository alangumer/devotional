    <h1>Working of the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo, there! for,
          behold, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke 17:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>The kingdom of heaven can be felt, but not seen. The inward working of the Spirit of God is compared to
          leaven.... Christ by this parable illustrates the</p>
      <p>human heart. The leaven of truth, working inwardly will be revealed in the life. The heart must be cleansed
          from all impurity, man must be ﬁtted with traits of character that will enable him to do service for God in
          any line. The process is invisible by which the leaven changes the mass of meal into which it has been
          introduced, but it works until the meal is converted into bread. So must the Spirit of God work a radical
          change. New faculties are not supplied, but a thorough change is made in the employment of those faculties.
          The natural inclinations are softened and subdued. New thoughts, new feelings, new motives are implanted. But
          while every faculty is regenerated, man does not lose his identity....</p>
      <p>The Scriptures are the great agency in this transformation. Christ prayed, “Sanctify them through thy truth:
          thy word is truth” (John 17:17). In this great work we are laborers together with God. With the divine agency
          there is to be the cooperation of the human instrument....</p>
      <p>The meal in which the leaven has been hid represents the heart that believes and receives Jesus. Christ works
          out the principles which He alone can work in. The world looks upon this class as a mystery which they cannot
          solve. The selﬁsh, <nobr>money-loving</nobr> man lives to eat and drink and enjoy his worldly goods. But he
          does not keep eternity in view. He loses the eternal world from his reckoning. But those who receive and
          believe the truth have that faith which works by love and puriﬁes the soul from everything sensual. The world
          cannot know them, for they are keeping in view eternal realities. A motive power is working within to
          transform the character. A constraining inﬂuence received from heaven is working like the leaven hid in the
          meal. The love of Jesus has come into the heart with its redeeming power to conquer the entire being, soul,
          body, and <nobr>spirit.—Manuscript</nobr> 82, June 26, 1898„ “The Leaven of Truth.”</p>
