    <h1>A Life Like His</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father, which
          is in heaven. Matthew 5:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The truth in the soul will be seen in the circumspect life. Levity of conduct, undue familiarity, will not
          exist. If everyone who claims to be a child of God would cherish the spirit of kindness and love, without base
          thoughts and undue attention, and devote his <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers to spreading the truth, in seeking
          to save souls, what a bright, steady light would shine forth to the world!</p>
      <p>If we believe that Christ alone can save souls by His matchless grace, how earnest would everyone be to hold up
          Christ, to be much in prayer as Christ was, and by living faith ask much in His name that he may receive, and
          be willing to spend and be spent to win souls to Christ. Let all who profess to be Christians open the door of
          their hearts to His Spirit and to His grace; then the peace of Christ will so rule in their hearts and be
          revealed in their characters that there will be no discord, no strife, no emulation, no biting and devouring
          one another, no seeking for the supremacy. The great and earnest effort will be to live the life of Christ. We
          are to represent His spirit of mercy and give no occasion for anyone to follow our example in doing evil.</p>
      <p>Jesus was courteous, benevolent. He was obedient to all of His Father’s commandments, implicitly and without
          questioning convenience or any selﬁsh interest. It is enough to us to know that God has spoken; and when we
          know His will as revealed in His Word, we are to obey.</p>
      <p>The world’s Redeemer is speaking to us; let us hear what He says: “Blessed are they that do his commandments,
          that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city” (Revelation
          22:14). Then those who see the claims of God in His Word and do not obey, but excuse their negligence or
          willful disregard of God’s requirements, testify by their course of action that they are not embraced in the
          blessed promise on condition of obedience. They are not the ones who will have a right to the tree of life,
          but are with the willful transgressors of the law of God to whom Jesus says, “Depart from me, all ye workers
          of iniquity” (Luke <nobr>13:27).—Manuscript</nobr> 15, July 17, 1885„ “Inﬂuence of Unconsecrated
          Workers.”</p>
