    <h1>Don’t Neglect Little Things</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment?
          Consider the lilies of the ﬁeld, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. Matthew 6:27,
          28.</strong></p>
      <p>I was called out to speak [to a large audience in Oakland, California] on the necessity of the deep and
          thorough work essential for every soul, that it may be strengthened with all might, and how there should be
          most earnest efforts made to help all with whom we are brought into connection, by precept and example, to
          strive for this thorough work to be done for them through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.</p>
      <p>A great many are likely to be deceived in regard to their spiritual condition. In Christ we shall have the
          victory. In Him we have a perfect Model. While He hated sin with a perfect hatred, He could weep over the
          sinner. He possessed the divine nature, while He had the humility of a little child. He had in His character
          that which we must have in our characters, undeviating perseverance in the path of duty, from which no
          obstacles or dangers could divert Him, while His heart was so full of compassion that the woes of humanity
          touched His heart with tenderest compassion. He could not pass them by, for He was the Great Physician to heal
          the maladies of the human race.</p>
      <p>He was the Majesty of heaven, doing work for the future and yet taking up and adjusting matters for the
          present; neglecting not the smaller matters, yet working out the mightiest plans for the inhabitants of a
          fallen world.</p>
      <p>Jesus, the precious Saviour, talked to His hearers in regard to their common duties of life, their care for
          dress, and their eating and drinking. He taught them that these things should not become a matter of absorbing
          interest, as though they must continually carry this burden. He pointed them to the birds and told them that
          their heavenly Father cares for even the little sparrow. He sustains the worlds, yet cares for the little
          birds, and how much more will He care for those who are formed in His image. He pointed to the ﬂowers of
          glowing beauty, invited them to consider these, and declared that in their naked simplicity they outvie the
          glory of Solomon; and yet they are cut down in a day. Are ye not much better than
          <nobr>they?—Manuscript</nobr> 21, September 27, 1889„ diary.</p>
