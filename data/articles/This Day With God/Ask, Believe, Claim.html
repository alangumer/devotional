      <p><strong>Lying lips are abomination to the Lord: but they that deal truly are his delight. Proverbs
          12:22.</strong></p>
      <p>I have a work to do and in the grace of Christ I shall do it. My only anxiety is for those who are so much more
          easily inclined to believe a lie than to believe the truth. What shall I do for them? What can I do to save
          them that they shall not make a lie, neither love the lie after it is made? All I can do is to present Jesus,
          the precious Saviour, before them as their pattern. If they love Jesus they will be pure, harmless, undeﬁled.
          They will surround themselves with the atmosphere of faith rather than of doubt and skepticism and unbelief.
          They will talk of Jesus, of heaven, of the Christian’s duties, the Christian’s warfare and how to successfully
          resist the powers of Satan. They will not be like vultures preying upon that which they suppose to be the
          defects of others.</p>
      <p>Oh, that Jesus might be revealed to them! Oh, that they might love to dwell upon His matchless charms! Oh, that
          their hearts might learn with His love, then we should not be ignorant of Satan’s devices. Our weapons would
          be turned against our most deadly foes. We should see by faith the pure light; eyes of heavenly angels
          intently ﬁxed upon us with love to mark our devotion. We should by faith see Satan watching for every
          <nobr>misstep—everything</nobr> that he could use against us, taking advantage of our lack of union and love,
          making the crooked ways and with exulting triumph accusing these before the angels of God....</p>
      <p>While we are powerless to stay the workings of sin and Satan, help has been provided. Ask and ye shall receive.
          Two or three may claim the promise, if they ask anything in His name, He will do it. He will be inquired of to
          do these things for us.</p>
      <p>Oh, my brother, do not feel so independent that you will not ask help of the only One who can render you the
          assistance you need to break the snare of Satan. You must be watchful, zealous, faithful and true; humble and
          trustful, full of tenderness and compassion....</p>
      <p>Commence the work in your own heart and then, with your heart baptized with the Spirit of Christ, lead your
          children to the Lamb of <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 11, May 12, 1883„ to a layman in California.</p>
