      <p><strong>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Psalm
          60:4.</strong></p>
      <p>See that the truth is inscribed on your banner at all times and in all places....</p>
      <p>As a nation the Jews refused to receive Christ. He had led them in their travels, as their invisible, inﬁnite
          Leader. He had communicated His will to them, but in the test they rejected Him, their only hope, their only
          salvation, and God rejected them. “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
          God, even to them that believe on his name” (John 1:12). To all who receive and obey the conditions, God’s
          gifts ﬂow steadily, without repentance, without recall. God has imparted His gifts to man to be used, not
          according to hereditary or fanciful ideas, not according to natural impulses or inclination, but according to
          His will....</p>
      <p>Those who feared God were to think for themselves. They were no longer to leave other men to do their thinking.
          Their minds were no longer to be chained down to erroneous maxims, theories, and doctrines. Ignorance and
          vice, crime and violence, oppression in high places, must be unveiled. The Light of life had come to this
          world to shine amid the moral darkness. The gospel would now be proclaimed among the poor, the oppressed.
          Those in humble life would be given opportunity to understand the real qualiﬁcations necessary for entrance
          into the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>And today men from the lower ranks are to take their place in obeying the command, “Go forward.” By faith they
          are to meet difﬁculties, not daring to yield to the strife and babble of unbelieving tongues. They are to
          press forward from one degree of success to another, praying always, and exercising that faith which answers
          prayer....</p>
      <p>The agencies of God are many! But all those who are willing to work according to God’s plan are included in the
          words, “Ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building” (1 Corinthians 3:9). God’s servants are to move so that
          no spiritual gift shall be lost. Their will is to be held in abeyance, and when God’s time comes, the rod will
          blossom. What form the work will take no one can know, but God’s servants are to be minutemen, able to
          understand the ways and will of their <nobr>Leader.—Letter</nobr> 8, January 23, 1899„ to Dr. J. H. Kellogg,
          medical superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.</p>
