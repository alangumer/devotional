    <h1>Cheerfulness Gloriﬁes God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and
          the Father by him. Colossians 3:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Where there is a heart in which the light of heaven does not radiate, there is a solitude in which Christ
          cannot abide. By the side of every soul is an angel presence. I have been instructed that with Christ there
          was given to our world all the treasures of heaven. Nothing was reserved. If man does not open the door of his
          heart to Christ Jesus and commune with Him, satanic agencies will commune with him.</p>
      <p>It is to the glory of God that cheerfulness abound. If the softening, subduing inﬂuence of the grace of Christ
          be present, pleasant words will always be spoken. If one makes mistakes, go to the erring one alone. Speak not
          words of counsel with a vim, but modulate your voice. He who occupies an inﬂuential position as God’s steward
          should take special care not to irritate by word or act. He should speak pleasantly to every worker, and
          reveal no irritability or sourness of disposition....</p>
      <p>Let everyone placed in a position of trust be as much more careful how he speaks and acts, as his position is
          greater in responsibility than the position of his fellow workers, for those connected with the work of God
          can please the Master by speaking kindly only. Any word spoken thoughtlessly or unadvisedly should be
          retracted on the spot. If the speaker forgets to do this, or if he does not regret his thoughtlessness,
          someone should in the spirit of Christ remind him of his duty to apologize, for we are to remember that as
          Christians professing to work in unity, we must not act like sinners, whose sinful words and works, unless
          repented of, will condemn them....</p>
      <p>Christians are to love one another, as Christ has loved them. Upon the manifestation of this love hinges the
          world’s recognition of the truth of the gospel. It was for this that Christ prayed in the last prayer He
          offered. Christians must not act like unruly children. Before the world those who claim to be God’s children
          must give evidence that they have left behind them the childish ways of their unconverted
          <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 179, November 19, 1902„ to C. P. Bollman, editor of the Southern Watchman, published
          in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
