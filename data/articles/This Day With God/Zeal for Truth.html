    <h1>Zeal for Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither
          forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. Deuteronomy 31:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Nothing in this world, no earthly favors or enjoyments, can take the place of the presence and favor of God.
          Without Him as our friend and portion, we are indeed alone. We may have many other friends, but they can never
          be to us what Christ is.</p>
      <p>Those who desire to ﬁnd pardon for past transgressions must come to Christ just as they are, saying, “Lord,
          though I have been bought with a price, and am Thy property, I have in the past refused to give myself to
          Thee. I now acknowledge that I am not my own, that I cannot do as I please with myself. Take me as I am, a
          poor, sinful creature, and cleanse and purify me from all sin by taking my sin Thine own dear self. I do not
          deserve this, but Thou art the only one who can save me. Take away my sin and give me Thy righteousness. I do
          not want to remain in sin one more day. Impart to me Thy righteousness, and keep me from all transgression of
          Thy holy law.”</p>
      <p>Do not limit the Holy One of Israel. Desire to see more of the manifestation of His love, that you may win
          others to the knowledge of His goodness....</p>
      <p>The Lord has pledged His glorious perfection that those who seek Him with humility of heart, confessing their
          sins, will ﬁnd Him precious to their souls. But those who refuse to obey, for fear of displeasing earthly
          friends, cannot be friends of God.</p>
      <p>Obey, obey, for Christ’s sake and for your own soul’s sake. Obey that which your conscience tells you is truth.
          Accept the grace and righteousness of Christ. God is tenderly calling you, “Come unto me, all ye that labour
          and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
          in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew
          <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr> If you refuse the invitation to repentance, to freedom from sin, the great day of God
          will ﬁnd you hopeless, shelterless, disobedient, a transgressor of His law. He will not then be able to give
          you a place in His kingdom. God help you to come now, is my <nobr>prayer.—Letter</nobr> 80, May 24, 1900„ to a
          layman in Australia.</p>
