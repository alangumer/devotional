    <h1>Preparation for Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou
          didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? 1 Corinthians 4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>It is that man may obtain the life that measures with the life of God that the Lord breaks up his worldly
          ambitious projects, which, if permitted to engross the mind, would unﬁt him for the future world.</p>
      <p>God is testing every one of us. He entrusts us with talents, to see whether we will be thoroughly unselﬁsh in
          the use we make of them. He tells us plainly, “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
          much” (Luke 16:10). “And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that
          which is your own?” (Verse 12).</p>
      <p>Let us remember that we are to be tried by the laws of Christ’s kingdom. We are not our own to do with
          ourselves as we please. We have been bought with a price, and the laws of Christ’s kingdom, the ten holy
          precepts, present the standard that we are to reach. God is jealous of His law. He test every man, to see
          whether he will obey or not.</p>
      <p>Man sinned, and death is the penalty of sin. Christ bore the penalty, and secured for man a period of
          probation. In this time of probation we are now living. We have been given an opportunity to prove ourselves
          of value in the sight of Him who gave His only begotten Son that we should not perish, but have everlasting
          life.</p>
      <p>One is our Master, even Christ. We are to remember that we are His <nobr>blood-bought</nobr> heritage. God’s
          will is to become our will. Physical, mental, and spiritual gifts have been placed in our possession. In the
          Bible, God’s will is plainly made known. God expects every man to use his gifts in a way that will give him an
          increased knowledge of the things of God, and will enable him to make improvement, to become more and more
          reﬁned, ennobled, and puriﬁed.</p>
      <p>In this world men and women are to ﬁt themselves to take their place among the nobility of heaven. In this
          world they are to prepare for translation into the courts above. Those who take up this work as the Bible
          directs, will, through the grace of Christ, become examples of what all must be who enter in through the gates
          into the <nobr>city.—Letter</nobr> 80, May 8, 1903„ to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.</p>
