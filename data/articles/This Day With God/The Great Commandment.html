    <h1>The Great Commandment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Matthew 22:36. Supreme love for God and unselﬁsh
          love for one another, these are the two</strong></p>
      <p>great arms upon which hang all the law and the prophets. A good tree produces good fruit. The evidence of love
          for Christ is the manifestation of love for one another. Unselﬁsh love for those around us is placed among the
          brightest evidences of true religion. By it a daily witness in Christ’s favor is borne to the world.</p>
      <p>The appetites and passions must be subdued and controlled, that the nerves may be steady and the brain able to
          see duty clearly. This can be done through divine grace. The gospel of Christ is the voice of duty and the
          voice of God.</p>
      <p>What is meant by a failure to obey it is seen in the history of Satan, who for his disobedience was cast out of
          heaven. The greatest talents and the highest gifts that could be bestowed on a created being were given to
          Lucifer, the covering cherub. Before his fall he was a glorious being, occupying a position next to Christ,
          but he sought to be equal with God, and brought upon himself irretrievable ruin.</p>
      <p>With this lesson before us, let us hide ourselves in Christ. He is the source of all wisdom, all intelligence,
          all power. Behold in the cross of Christ the only guarantee for our salvation. Behold the Saviour giving His
          life for us, that we might be Christians. Those who strive to live the life of a Christian are battling
          against the devil’s lie. Can we doubt the result of this conﬂict? God lives, God reigns, and daily He is
          working His miracles. “They that are Christ’s have cruciﬁed the ﬂesh with the affections and lusts” (Galatians
          5:24). Before the world and the heavenly universe they give evidence that they are trying to live out the
          words, “Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
          things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; ...think on these things”
          (Philippians 4:8).</p>
      <p>Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, these are the fruits of the
          Christian <nobr>tree.—Letter</nobr> 21, 1901, written October 5, 1900, to an evangelist in New York City.</p>
