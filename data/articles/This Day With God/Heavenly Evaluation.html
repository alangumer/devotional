    <h1>Heavenly Evaluation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
          sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Romans 12:1.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a measurement of character constantly going on. The angels of God are estimating your moral value, and
          ascertaining your needs, and bearing your case to God. How earnestly we should strive to meet the mind of the
          Spirit of God! And O, how thankful we should be that help has been laid upon One who is mighty to save!
          ...</p>
      <p>Do you manifest impatience, and utter hasty words? Are you full of <nobr>self-esteem?</nobr> Have you lustful
          thoughts and practices? Are you doing things directly contrary to the purposes of God? Are you robbing your
          heavenly Father by withholding your talents and your heart from Him? Why not cease doing this way? Why not
          make a full surrender to God? He will impart to you His light and peace, and you will taste of His salvation.
          Do not any longer bring to God a lame, diseased offering. Your powers, mental and physical, are enfeebled by
          your own course of transgression; but such an offering is not acceptable to heaven. Why not come and be healed
          of your inﬁrmities, and offer a living sacriﬁce, holy, and without blemish? Have you been robbing God in
          tithes and offerings? Here is instruction for you. Says the Lord, “Bring ye all the tithes into the
          storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I
          will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
          receive it” (Malachi 3:10). Why not take the Lord at His word? It is our privilege to experience the joy of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>It would be a difﬁcult matter to convince those who have tasted of the rich knowledge of Christ, that He is as
          a root out of dry ground, without form or comeliness; and He may become to our souls “the chiefest among ten
          thousand,” and the One “altogether lovely” (Song of Solomon 5:10, 16). I love Him! I love Him! I see in Jesus
          matchless charms. I see in Him everything to be desired by the children of men. Let us come to the “Lamb of
          God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Let us, through His merits and righteousness, obtain
          a ﬁtting up for heaven. The broken and contrite heart He will not <nobr>despise.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          April 2, 1889.</p>
