      <p><strong>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.... For</strong></p>
      <p>they are life unto those that ﬁnd them, and health to all their ﬂesh. Proverbs <nobr>4:20-22.</nobr></p>
      <p>We are living amid the perils of the last days. The Spirit of God is being withdrawn from the earth, but the
          Lord has not left you, my brother. I am bidden to encourage you to believe that your life has not been wasted.
          Wake up, my brother, and the Lord will guide you to the work He has for you. But do not longer please the
          enemy by yielding to the temptation to despair. Let the truth of God be to your soul as the sunshine and the
          vital air.</p>
      <p>My brother, will you not cooperate with the great Healer? It is necessary that you exercise your muscles as
          well as your nerves.... The hands, the feet, all</p>
      <p>the muscular organs were created for action. And if you do not exercise these organs and your brain power
          proportionately, you will lose that vitality which you should preserve.</p>
      <p>The Lord has instructed me to tell you that you are to use the members of the body as well as the brain. Find
          something that you can do about the place, and make it a special charge to use the limbs and also the organs
          of speech....</p>
      <p>I remember one of our workers who some years ago came to the institution in St. Helena. He was so weak he felt
          he could not arise from his bed. The physician in charge of the case told me, “I see no hope for him unless we
          can get him off from the bed and make use of his limbs and his mind in some way.” I advised the doctor to
          persuade the patient to dress himself for a short walk for the purpose of asking him his opinion about
          something. It proved to be a difﬁcult matter to get him off his bed, but he succeeded, and again the next day,
          he went a little farther. After three weeks, the man needed no further urging, and he soon acquired a good
          appetite for hygienic food. This was seventeen years ago, and the man is still alive, strong in brain, bone,
          and muscle.</p>
      <p>My brother, you cannot be what you should be physically unless you exercise the powers of your being
          equally.... The Lord is your Helper and your God. He</p>
      <p>desires to take your case in hand, and He will cooperate with you, as you put in working order brain, bone, and
          muscle. Will you take this prescription of the great <nobr>Physician?—Letter</nobr> 160, April 30, 1907„ to
          Brother and Sister J. A. Starr.</p>
