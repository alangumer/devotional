    <h1>Constant Communion With God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Matthew
          24:44.</strong></p>
      <p>I believe we are on the very borders of the eternal world, and I am seeking to keep in constant communion with
          God. I prize eternal life and nothing shall separate me from the love of God. I want constantly to educate and
          train my soul to lean on Christ, to draw spiritual strength from Christ. God intends that we shall have an
          experimental knowledge of Christ, then we can be faithful witnesses for God, testifying of the grace of Christ
          in words and actions, by conscious and unconscious inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>I fear, greatly fear, that many of the youth connected with the work of God do not know my Saviour. When I
          think of the work that God is doing for fallen man, I am lost in wonder that God will take poor, fallen beings
          and bring to them moral power, that there will be the internal workings of His grace, transforming the
          character and making men ﬁt for the mansions God is preparing for <nobr>them—beings</nobr> ﬁtted for the
          presence of God, ﬁtted to be companions with angels, and to hold communion with God. Oh, how my heart yearns
          to be one who shall walk with Jesus Christ in the earth made new....</p>
      <p>Our lifework now should be to prepare for eternity. We know not how soon our lifework here may close, and how
          essential that our low, sinful nature should be overcome, and we conform to the image of Christ. We have not
          one moment’s time to squander. We need to be daily preparing for eternity. Our lifetime is granted us to seek
          the boon of eternal life. God has granted us a probation, and, if we live our threescore years and ten, how
          short is this period to work out our salvation! Then compare this period with the life that measures with the
          life of God. The short period of our test and proving may end any time. Then how earnest should we be to
          secure a clear title to a home in the earth made new....</p>
      <p>My anxiety is to do the work the Master has given me to do and let nothing divert me from this work.... We must
          seek to be one with God. His interest must</p>
      <p>be our interest, His sentiments and designs ours. We know the love of God for sinners and the inﬁnite sacriﬁce
          that has been made to save perishing souls; then let us unite with Christ in this great
          <nobr>work.—Letter</nobr> 82, April 18, 1887„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
