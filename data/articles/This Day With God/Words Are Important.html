    <h1>Words Are Important</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my
          strength, and my redeemer. Psalm 19:14.</strong></p>
      <p>We all need to study the life of Christ and the lessons He gave, that we may know how to conduct ourselves in
          our relation with one another. Cherish the soothing inﬂuence of the Spirit of God. Remember that speech is a
          talent of great value, if used aright, and that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. Remember
          also that by thy words thou shalt be justiﬁed and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Unadvised words often
          create difﬁculties which otherwise would not exist.</p>
      <p>We are placed in this world to be children of God and to prepare for the future immortal life. Speak no unkind,
          thoughtless words. As you associate in family relationship, be careful to speak kind, tender words, which will
          comfort and encourage. Do not forget the little acts of kindness which do so much to help the member of the
          family who is struggling with inﬁrmities which no one but himself can understand.</p>
      <p>It does not pay to persist in having one’s own way, to be unwilling to yield in the little things which are of
          small consequence, thus bringing bitterness and wrath into the home. Life is too short, too full of sorrow. We
          have no time to spare for the bruising of any sore, tempted heart.</p>
      <p>Let each one be kind and considerate of the other. Never let the sun go down upon your wrath. Never close your
          eyes in sleep without making right the little, pettish difﬁculties which hurt and bruise the soul....</p>
      <p>When you are tempted to think or speak unwisely, kneel wherever you are, and pray till you ﬁnd rest in Jesus. I
          am sure that He will not leave you or forsake you. You may scorn yourself because of your passionate
          utterances, but remember that Jesus pities you, and that He will heal you, body and soul, if you will do His
          bidding. Here is His word to you, “Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he
          shall make peace with me” (Isaiah 27:5).</p>
      <p>Jesus desires to make celestial harmony in your soul. Read His words, not with discouragement, but with
          conﬁdence and hope. Listen to the blessed words which God speaks to you. Walking with Christ means to believe
          that, though unseen, Christ is walking with <nobr>you.—Letter</nobr> 104, August 4, 1901„ to E. K.
          Beaman.</p>
