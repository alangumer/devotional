    <h1>Christ Is Not Divided</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.... And the eye
          cannot say unto the hand, I have no need</strong></p>
      <p>of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 1 Corinthians <nobr>12:18-21.</nobr></p>
      <p>Because men are not of the same stamp of character, this is no reason why they should draw apart. If we are
          children of the heavenly King, we shall not be at such variance that we shall stand in one another’s way.</p>
      <p>It is by the Lord’s orders that His servants have varied gifts. It is by His appointment that men of varied
          minds are brought into the church, to be laborers together with Him. We have many different minds to meet, and
          different gifts are needed. God’s servants are to work in perfect harmony. I thank the Lord that we are not
          all exactly the same, while we are all to have the same <nobr>spirit—the</nobr> spirit that dwelt in Christ.
          The apostle John was not the same as the apostle Peter. Each was to subdue his peculiarities and soften his
          temperament, that they might help each other, through belief in and sanctiﬁcation of the truth.</p>
      <p>It is the righteousness of Christ that goes before us. It is His character that we are to copy. And then
          <nobr>what?—The</nobr> glory of the Lord shall be our rearward. Our Leader goes before us, and as we follow
          Him, He imparts to us His righteousness, which is revealed in our lives by a <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life
          and a godly conversation. It is faith and works that makes us Christians, preparing us to sit together in
          heavenly places with Christ.</p>
      <p>Is Christ <nobr>divided?—No.</nobr> Christ abiding in the soul will not quarrel with Christ in another soul. We
          must learn to bear with the peculiarities of those around us. If our will is under the control of Christ’s
          will, how can we be at variance with our brethren? If we are at variance, we may know that it is because self
          needs to be cruciﬁed. He whom Christ makes free is free indeed. We are not complete in Christ unless we love
          one another as Christ has loved us. When we do this, as Christ has given us commandment, we shall give
          evidence that we are complete in Him.</p>
      <p>We must have the faith which prophets foretold and apostles <nobr>preached—the</nobr> faith that works by love
          and puriﬁes the <nobr>soul.—Letter</nobr> 141, September 10, 1902„ to Elder S. N. Haskell, in city evangelism
          in New York City.</p>
