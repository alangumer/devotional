    <h1>Christ, the Magnet</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but
          in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. Acts 10:34,
          35.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ recognizes no caste, no nationality. He holds it as His prerogative, divine and incommunicable, to work
          after His own might and pleasure. The compassionate Redeemer, He labored among all classes. When the paralytic
          was let down through the roof at His feet, He saw at a glance the trouble of the sufferer, and He immediately
          exercised His power as a <nobr>sin-pardoning</nobr> Saviour. “Be of good cheer,” He said; “thy sins be
          forgiven thee” (Matthew 9:2).</p>
      <p>At this, some of the scribes said within themselves, “Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive
          sins but God only?” (Mark 2:7). How astonished they were to have their unspoken thoughts opened before them.
          “Why reason ye these things in your hearts?” Jesus asked. “Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the
          palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? But that ye may know that
          the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee,
          Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house” (Verses <nobr>8-11).</nobr></p>
      <p>Christ changed the relation of the sinner toward God, taking the guilt from the inmost soul. The rich fool died
          in his bloated wealth, but the helpless sinner was brought to Christ, and manifesting his belief that Christ
          could heal him, he was not disappointed. His diseased mind was ﬁrst cured, and then the great Physician cured
          his bodily inﬁrmities.</p>
      <p>Thus Christ drew the people to Him. He was unfolding truths of the highest order. The knowledge He came to
          impart was the gospel, in all its richness and power. The sin bearer, He is alive to all the horrors which sin
          brings upon the soul, and He came to this world with a message of deliverance.</p>
      <p>What is Christianity? God’s instrumentality for the conversion of the sinner. Jesus will call to account every
          one who is not brought under His control, who does not demonstrate in his life the inﬂuence of the cross of
          Calvary. Christ should be uplifted by those whom He has redeemed by dying on the
          <nobr>cross.—Manuscript</nobr> 56, April 7, 1899„ “Following Christ.”</p>
