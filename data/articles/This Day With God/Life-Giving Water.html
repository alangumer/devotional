    <h1>Life-Giving Water</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee,
          Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. John
          4:10.</strong></p>
      <p>This message is meant for us just as surely as for the woman of Samaria. It comes sounding down along the line
          from age to age, “If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
          wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.” Rivet this in your minds. Every soul
          should awaken to an understanding of his spiritual need....</p>
      <p>How very many there are that know not the gift of God. They talk of the truth, they talk of heaven and of
          religion, they talk of faith, but they know it not. They have not an experimental knowledge what faith means,
          or what it is to trust God, of what it is to drink of the living water of life day by day.</p>
      <p>Are there any ...that are thirsting for the living water, and <nobr>feel—O,</nobr> that I might ﬁnd it? I look
          to the right and it is not there, I seek it to the left and I ﬁnd it not. I look before me, and behind me, and
          yet I cannot ﬁnd my Saviour. Do you want to know how to ﬁnd Him? Come to Him just as needy and dependent as
          you are, in the simplicity of a little child, in all the conﬁdence that a child has in its parents, and ask
          your Saviour to pity you in your great necessity. Tell Him that you want the water of salvation....</p>
      <p>Unless we shall drink of the water that Christ gives, we cannot improve our own situation or of those that are
          around us. Only by being supplied by that grace which Jesus Christ can give us and is longing to bestow upon
          us, will the necessities of the souls that are ready to perish be met.</p>
      <p>It was not because this woman was a Samaritan that she did not know Christ, for He came to save the Samaritans
          as well as the Jews. With Him there is no cast or special favored people. He came to take away the sins of the
          world. This He is willing to do for all, Jew or Gentile, and this we must have done for us before we can enter
          heaven. We must let Him take away our sins because in Him was no sin. He is our
          <nobr>sin-bearer.—Manuscript</nobr> 18, October 19, 1895,.</p>
