    <h1>Securing Our Inheritance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to
          fornication, and going after strange ﬂesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
          ﬁre. Jude 1:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The outlook in our world is indeed alarming. God is withdrawing His Spirit from the wicked cities, which have
          become as the cities of the antediluvian world, and as Sodom and Gomorrah. The inhabitants of these cities
          have been tested and tried. We have reached a time when God is about to punish the presumptuous wrongdoers,
          who refuse to keep His commandments and disregard His messages of warning. He who bears long with evildoers
          gives everyone an opportunity to seek Him and humble their hearts before Him.</p>
      <p>Everyone has opportunity to come to Christ and be converted, that He may heal them. But there will come a time
          when mercy will be no longer offered. Costly mansions, marvels of architectural skill, will be destroyed
          without a moment’s notice, when the Lord sees that the owners have passed the boundaries of forgiveness. The
          destruction by ﬁre of the stately buildings supposed to be ﬁreproof is an illustration of how in a short time
          earth’s architecture will lie in ruins....</p>
      <p>The <nobr>twenty-fourth</nobr> chapter of Matthew gives an outline of what is to come upon the world. We are
          living amid the perils of the last days. Those who are perishing in sin must be warned. The Lord calls upon
          every one to whom He has entrusted the talent of means to act as His helping hand by giving their money for
          the advancement of His work. Our money is a treasure lent us by the Lord, and it is to be invested in the work
          of giving to the world the last message of mercy....</p>
      <p>He who looks at earthly things as the chief good, he who spends his life in an effort to gain worldly riches,
          is indeed making a poor investment. Too late he will see that in which he has trusted crumbling into dust. It
          is only through <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> through the sacriﬁce of earthly riches, that the eternal riches can
          be obtained. It is through much tribulation that the Christian enters the kingdom of heaven. Constantly he is
          to war the good warfare, not laying down his weapons until Christ bids him rest. Only by giving all to Christ
          can he secure the inheritance that will endure through all <nobr>eternity.—Letter</nobr> 90, May 23, 1902„ to
          Brother Johnson, a layman.</p>
