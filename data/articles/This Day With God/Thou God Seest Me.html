      <p><strong>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened
          unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Hebrews 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The triumph of the truth is possible only when the workers carry with them an abiding consciousness of the
          presence of God. They should ever realize that there is a faithful witness to every word, every transaction,
          in the home life or among the people. In every plan devised, in every effort made, Christ is to direct. In
          every council the members should speak and act as if the curtain were withdrawn, and they saw themselves
          transacting business in the presence of the heavenly universe. For this is the fact in the case; all heaven is
          looking upon the workers. In planning for aggressive warfare, let not self be made prominent; it must be
          hidden, wholly hidden, in Christ....</p>
      <p>Everything that can be shaken will be shaken, and those things that cannot be shaken will remain.</p>
      <p>The Lord requires our undivided affections. If men are not wholehearted, they will fail in the day of test and
          proving and trial. When the enemy shall put his forces in array against him, and the battle seems to go hard,
          at the very time when all the strength of intellect and capability, and all the tact of wise generalship, is
          needed to repulse the enemy, those who are <nobr>half-hearted</nobr> will turn their weapons against their own
          soldiers; they weaken the hands that should be strong for warfare. God is testing all who have a knowledge of
          the truth to see if they can be depended on to ﬁght the battles of the Lord when hard pressed by
          principalities and powers and the rulers of the darkness of this world and wicked spirits in high places.
          Perilous times are before us, and our only safety is in having the converting power of God every
          <nobr>day—yielding</nobr> ourselves fully to Him to do His will, and walk in the light of His countenance (see
          1 Peter 2:9).</p>
      <p>Now when we are just on the borders of the promised land, let none repeat the sin of the unfaithful spies. They
          acknowledged that the land they went up to see was a good land, but they declared that the inhabitants were
          strong, the giants were there, and that they themselves were in comparison as grasshoppers in the sight of the
          people and in their own sight. All the difﬁculties were magniﬁed into insurmountable obstacles.... Thus they
          leavened the whole congregation</p>
      <p>with their <nobr>unbelief.—Manuscript</nobr> 6, January 5, 1892„ “Work in Christ’s Lines.”</p>
