    <h1>Open the Door</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
          him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Revelation 3:20.</strong></p>
      <p>When the heart is emptied of <nobr>self-importance,</nobr> the door will be opened to Christ, because you will
          recognize His knock. But unless you clear away the rubbish that keeps the Lord Jesus out, He cannot possibly
          enter; for He forces no entrance.</p>
      <p>In the visions of the night I have been bearing a decided testimony that the Lord Jesus will be found of all
          who will seek Him with the whole heart, and lay hold of Him by faith. I was addressing you with intensity of
          earnestness. Answer the prayer of Christ for unity, and put away the suspicions with which Satan has been
          trying to lead you astray. Dismiss the enemy, and then the Spirit of the Lord will lift up for you a standard
          against the enemy....</p>
      <p>The prosperity of the soul depends upon Christ’s atoning sacriﬁce. He came to this world to obtain forgiveness
          in our behalf. Our ﬁrst work is to strive most earnestly for spiritual blessings, in order that we may be kept
          loyal and true amidst the perils of these last <nobr>days—kept</nobr> from yielding one inch to Satan’s
          devices. It is the duty of every one to make straight paths for his feet, lest the lame be turned out of the
          way. We have no time to lose. The prosperity of the soul depends upon the oneness that Christ prayed might
          exist among those who believe in Him. They are to be one with Him as He is one with the Father. Drawing apart
          from one another is not God’s plan, but the plan of the artful foe.</p>
      <p>We are to beware of those who are denying their past experience, and who, through specious devising, would if
          possible deceive the very elect. He who is our Advocate in the heavenly courts is acquainted with every
          particular of the deceptive wiles of those who are doing this work. Those who are departing from the faith are
          at work to undermine the conﬁdence of others, and they have been thus at work for years. Our warnings come
          from the One who is interested in us, because He sees our dangers, and is acquainted with the conniving of
          those who are opposed to His truth....</p>
      <p>He who is our Intercessor in the heavenly courts will purify His people. Christ will perfect His
          <nobr>saints.—Letter</nobr> 90, March 6, 1906„ to the brethren assembled in council at Graysville,
          Tennessee.</p>
