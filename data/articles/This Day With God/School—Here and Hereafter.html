      <p><strong>They crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. Hebrews
          6:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Each one must heed for himself the call, “Come unto me, ...and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).... The
          Lord Jesus has paid your tuition fees. All</p>
      <p>that you have to do is to learn of Him. The Christlike politeness practiced in the higher school is to be
          practiced in this lower school, by both old and young believers.</p>
      <p>All who learn in Christ’s school are under the training of heavenly agencies; and they are never to forget that
          they are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. They are to represent Christ. They are to help one
          another to become worthy of admission into the higher school. They are to help one another to be pure and
          noble, and to cherish a true idea of what it means to be a child of God. They are to speak encouraging words.
          They are to lift up the feeble hands and strengthen the feeble knees. Upon every heart there is to be
          inscribed the words, as with the point of a diamond, “There is nothing that I fear, save that I shall not know
          my duty, or shall fail to do it.” We are living in a time when we should seek the Lord most earnestly....</p>
      <p>There are many ways in which human beings can crucify the Son of God afresh, and put Him to open shame. The
          worship of worldly business so confuses the mind that Satan stealthily approaches, and insidiously gains
          entrance. He has many theories by which to lead astray those who will be led. The erroneous views of God that
          the world is entertaining are skepticism in disguise, preparing the way for atheism. By hasty words and selﬁsh
          deeds, men often grieve the heart of Christ. thus Satan works untiringly to lead them to disloyalty. As he
          gains control of minds, he makes upon them lasting impressions, and the realities of eternity fade away.</p>
      <p>A <nobr>self-controlled</nobr> spirit, words of love and tenderness, honor the Saviour. Those who speak kind,
          loving words; words that make for peace, will be richly rewarded. We are the appointed ministers of Christ,
          and we are to let His Spirit shine forth in the meekness and lowliness learned of <nobr>Him.—Letter</nobr>
          257, November 26, 1903„ to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.</p>
