    <h1>A Standard Against the Enemy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.
          Isaiah 59:19.</strong></p>
      <p>God desires every man to understand his duty and obey the call, working in the way of the Lord, not after his
          own devising. God always rewards the conﬁdence of His people. The way to the throne of mercy is always open.
          God sees the wants of His people as clearly in the darkness of midnight which surrounds them as in the
          splendor of noonday. To look to God for help at all times, this is our safety.</p>
      <p>When God grants us His protection, and says of us, “Ye are labourers together with me,” if you keep the way of
          the Lord you are safe in the midst of the greatest dangers. When Satan seeks to deceive the child of faith and
          trust, God lifts up a standard against the enemy in behalf of those who are conscientiously working in harmony
          with Him. The standard which He uplifts is His law. Those who work righteousness have an
          <nobr>ever-present</nobr> Friend to help them. In every time of need and trouble and perplexity He is near
          them. When they are tempted He presents Himself as their defense, saying, “I will guide thee with Mine eye. I
          will deliver thee from perplexity, and be a covert for thee against the strife of tongues.”</p>
      <p>The Lord sees not as man sees. Those whom He loves and honors most are often the objects of the scorn and
          derision of the enemy. He desires us to learn the lesson that we shall not gain success in the work by
          following the criterion of the world or the devising of human beings....</p>
      <p>Hypocrisy and pretense can ﬁnd no place with God. All that we put our hands to is performed [as] in the sight
          of the heavenly intelligences. All the thoughts of the mind, all the aspirations of the soul, are read by Him
          with whom we have to do. The victories gained by the soul are not measured by outside appearance or by the
          praise of men, but by goodness and mercy and tender compassion and a ﬁrm adherence to God’s law....</p>
      <p>God’s people are in danger, notwithstanding the great light that shines upon their pathway, of following the
          customs of the world....</p>
      <p>Let us be true to our colors. Let us raise the standard on which is inscribed, “The commandments of God and the
          faith of <nobr>Jesus.”—Letter</nobr> 99, July 9, 1900„ to a physician in Australia.</p>
