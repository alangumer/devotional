    <h1>How God Sees Greatness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and
          for the honour of my majesty? Daniel 4:30.</strong></p>
      <p>The strength of nations and of individuals is not found in the opportunities and facilities that appear to make
          them invincible; it is not found in their boasted greatness. That which alone can make them great or strong is
          the power and purpose of God. They themselves, by their attitude toward His purpose, decide their own
          destiny.</p>
      <p>Human histories relate man’s achievements, his victories in battle, his success in climbing to worldly
          greatness. God’s history describes man as heaven views him. In the divine records all his merit is seen to
          consist in his obedience to God’s requirements. His disobedience is faithfully chronicled as meriting the
          punishment he will surely receive. In the light of eternity it will be seen that God deals with men in
          accordance with the momentous question of obedience or disobedience.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of years before a people has come upon the stage of action, the prophetic pen, under the dictation of
          the Holy Spirit, has traced its history....</p>
      <p>The voice of God, heard in past ages, is sounding down along the line from century to century, through
          generations that have come on the stage of action and passed away. Shall God speak, and His voice not be
          respected? What power mapped out all this history, that nations, one after another, should ﬁll in their
          predicted time and place, unconsciously witnessing to the truth of which they themselves knew not the meaning?
          ...</p>
      <p>To every man, God has assigned a place in His great plan. By truth or falsehood, by folly or wisdom, each is
          fulﬁlling a purpose, bringing about certain results....</p>
      <p>In the eyes of the world, those who serve God may appear weak. They may be apparently sinking beneath the
          billows, but with the next billow they are seen rising nearer to their haven. “I give unto them eternal life,”
          saith our Lord; “...neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand” (John 10:28). Though kings shall be cast
          down, and nations removed, the souls that through faith link themselves with God’s purposes shall abide
          forever. “They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to
          righteousness as the stars for ever and ever” (Daniel <nobr>12:3).—Manuscript</nobr> 36, December 9, 1896„
