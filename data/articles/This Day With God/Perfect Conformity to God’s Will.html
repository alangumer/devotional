    <h1>Perfect Conformity to God’s Will</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. Hebrews 13:8. My brother and sister, we need
          to keep before us the example of Christ’s perfection. When we allow our minds to dwell upon the imperfections
          of others,</strong></p>
      <p>our own souls become ﬁlled with the leaven of evil.</p>
      <p>In our endeavors to represent the truth for this time to the world, we shall meet with many difﬁculties, but,
          if we will keep the heart and mind ﬁxed upon the precious Saviour, if we talk of His love and power, the
          perplexities will pass away, and we shall become happy in the assurance of a Saviour’s love. We are not
          dependent upon the world and its changeableness. He in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
          and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, is our joy and crown of rejoicing, our peace,
          our power, our satisfaction. Then let us rejoice, whatever may happen, within and without.</p>
      <p>We must obtain that measure of the grace of Christ that will enable us to dwell together in love and unity in
          this life, else we can never dwell together in the life to come. I am trying to show our people the need of
          the unity for which Christ prayed. The soul must fully own the power and authority of the Word of God. Christ,
          the perfect example, is ever before us. To Him we may look for grace and power to overcome every fault.</p>
      <p>We are to get ready for the great day of God by carrying out in the daily life the perfect principles presented
          to us in the life of Christ. We are called by Him to be His representatives. We are God’s children. By
          spiritual adoption we become His sons and daughters. We are to live in conformity to His will, representing
          Him in life and character.</p>
      <p>Perfect conformity to the will of God is the condition of which eternal life is given.... May the Lord bless
          you, my brother and sister, and lead you, through</p>
      <p>a knowledge of His Word, to a perfect understanding of His will concerning <nobr>you.—Letter</nobr> 96,
          December 29, 1911„ to Mrs. J. J. Gravelle, a lay sister in North Dakota.</p>
