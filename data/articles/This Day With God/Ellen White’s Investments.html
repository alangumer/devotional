    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens
          that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. Luke 12:33.</strong></p>
      <p>We are all well this morning. Last night, Mr. and Mrs. A called. We had a good visit. The conversation ran on
          bank stock, how many were getting rich from investing their means. Some also were meeting with loss. Thus
          losses and gains were discussed by Mr. and Mrs. A and Sister B and C.</p>
      <p>“Now,” Mrs. A said, “Mrs. White must say something. She must tell us what she thinks. She has not said a word
          yet.”</p>
      <p>“Well,” said I, slowly, “I have been many years investing in bank stock, and met with no loss. It has yielded
          me back all the principal and heavy interest.”</p>
      <p>All looked up with surprise. C smiled. Mr. A asked, “Where have you invested?”</p>
      <p>“In heavenly stock. I have been sending my treasure before me into heaven. The owner in this heavenly stock had
          warned me, ‘Lay not up for yourself treasures upon the earth,’ and told me the danger I should incur of great
          losses; but He had counseled me, ‘Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
          corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.’ This investment is certain, and will yield immense
          proﬁts.”</p>
      <p>Mrs. A remarked, “And it will pay every day as you go along. You may not have to wait the rise and fall of
          stock. It is sure returns; no danger of losses.”</p>
      <p>We then bade them good night, and left them this to think of. Praise the name of the Lord for the evidence we
          have daily of our treasure being laid up in heaven; precious investment. I want the assurance from day to day
          that Jesus is mine and I am <nobr>His.—Letter</nobr> 20, May 1, 1876,.</p>
      <p>“Charge them that are rich in this world...that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to
          communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay
          hold on eternal life” (1 Timothy <nobr>6:17-19).</nobr> Here is a wise and perfectly safe investment; good
          works are here speciﬁed and recommended for our practice, for your practice. Here are proﬁts that are
          valuable. There will be no danger of a failure <nobr>here.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 1:693.</p>
