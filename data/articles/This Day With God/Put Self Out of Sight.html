      <p><strong>We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience, and
          experience, hope. Romans 5:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>The experience gained in the furnace of trial and afﬂiction is worth more than the inconvenience and painful
          experience it all costs. The prayers you offered in your loneliness, in your weariness and trial, God answered
          as you could bear it. You did not have clear and correct views of your brethren, neither did you see yourself
          in a correct light. But in the providence of God, He has been at work to answer the prayers you have offered
          in your distress in a way to save you and glorify His own name.</p>
      <p>In your ignorance of yourself, you asked for things which were not the best for you. God hears your prayers of
          sincerity, but the blessing granted is something very different from your expectations. God designed to place
          you in His providence in connection with His church more directly, that your conﬁdence should be less in
          yourself and greater in others whom He is leading out to extend His work....</p>
      <p>It is God that has led you through straight places. He had a purpose in this, that tribulation might work in
          you patience, and patience experience, and experience hope. The trials He permitted to come upon you were that
          through the exercise of these you would experience the peaceable fruits of righteousness....</p>
      <p>God would lead you through afﬂiction and trials that you might have more perfect trust and conﬁdence in Him and
          that you might think less of your own judgment. You can bear adversity better than prosperity. The
          <nobr>all-seeing</nobr> eye of Jehovah detected in you much dross that you considered gold and too valuable to
          throw away. The enemy’s power over you had at times been direct and very strong....</p>
      <p>Your will must be molded by God’s will or you will fall into grievous temptations. I saw that when you labor in
          God, putting self out of sight, you will realize a strength from God which will give you access to
          hearts....</p>
      <p>You are not always kindly, considerate of the feelings of others, and you create trials and dissatisfaction,
          all needlessly. More love in your labors, more kindly sympathy would give you access to hearts and win souls
          to Christ and the <nobr>truth.—Letter</nobr> 54, October 24, 1874„ to an early SDA minister.</p>
