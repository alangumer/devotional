    <h1>Take Hold of Divine Strength</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty.
          Psalm 89:19.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord loves you. The Lord is of tender compassion. His promise is, “Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh
          to you” (James 4:8). When the enemy comes in like a ﬂood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up for you a
          standard against him. Bear in mind that Jesus Christ is your hope. In the sad, discouraging things that shall
          come to you at any time, Christ says to you, “Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with
          me; and he shall make peace with me” (Isaiah 27:5).</p>
      <p>Your work is to take hold of the strength that is as ﬁrm as is the eternal throne. Believe in God. Trust in
          Him. Be cheerful under all circumstances. Although you may have trials, know that Christ suffered these
          afﬂicting things in behalf of His heritage. Nothing is as dear to the Lord as His church. The Lord looks at
          the heart. He knows who are His. The Lord will test and prove every soul that lives. “Many shall be puriﬁed,
          and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the
          wise shall understand” (Daniel 12:10)....</p>
      <p>Let those who love God and are doers of His word sing praise and thanksgiving rather than speak words of
          accusing and faultﬁnding and murmuring. The Lord will bless those who make for peace....</p>
      <p>Trust in the Lord. Let not the feelings, the speeches, or the attitude of any human agent depress you. Be
          careful that in words or act you do not give others any opportunity to obtain the advantage in hurting you.
          Keep looking unto Jesus. He is your strength. By beholding Jesus you will become changed into His likeness. He
          will be the health of your countenance and your God....</p>
      <p>The church needs you, and you need to soften and subdue your own feelings for Christ’s sake. He wants you to
          have His Holy Spirit to work you. Then you may impart life and comfort to the church. Let your words be well
          chosen that you may be a real blessing to the church. Do not afﬂict your souls over the inconsistencies of
          others. Take yourselves in hand, and be consistent in all <nobr>things.—Letter</nobr> 125, August 24, 1900„ to
          Brother and Sister James, new believers in Australia.</p>
