      <p><strong>Is not my word like as a ﬁre? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
          Jeremiah 23:29.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord desires His children to act well their part, and be at peace one with another through Christ, the
          <nobr>peace-giver.</nobr> When Christ abides in the heart, the powers of the whole being work in unity and
          harmony. The whole individual person’s reason, and the affections, knowing how to act their parts, labor
          together unitedly. Like a king upon his throne, reason rules the working machinery.</p>
      <p>It may be that much work needs to be done in your character building, that you are a rough stone which must be
          squared and polished before it is ﬁt to ﬁll a place in God’s temple. You need not be surprised if with hammer
          and chisel God cuts away your defects of character, until you are prepared to ﬁll the place He has ready for
          you. No human being can accomplish this work. Only by God can it be done. And be assured that He will not
          strike one useless blow. His every blow is struck in love, for your eternal good and happiness. He knows your
          inﬁrmities, and works to restore, not to destroy.</p>
      <p>Why do we turn from divine wisdom to human wisdom? God sees the dishonor we do Him. He knows that in humanity
          we shall ﬁnd no solace for our woe, and He pities us because we are so needy, yet so unwilling to make Him our
          conﬁdant, our <nobr>burden-bearer.</nobr> He sees human beings slighting the love and mercy provided for them,
          and He says sadly, “Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life” (John 5:40).</p>
      <p>Our distrust is an insult to the One who has done so much for us. He will never neglect those who come to Him.
          Of the poor, fainting soul, tired of looking to humanity only to be betrayed and forgotten, Christ says, “Let
          him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me” (Isaiah
          27:5).</p>
      <p>Christ desires to say of His people as He said of Israel of old, “And thy renown went forth among the heathen
          for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God”
          (Ezekiel <nobr>16:14).—Manuscript</nobr> 5, January 15, 1901„ “A Very Present Help.”</p>
