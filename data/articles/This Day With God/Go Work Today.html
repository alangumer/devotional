    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
          Proverbs 9:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Capabilities have been entrusted to every soul. These are talents to be improved by faithful service, that
          Christ at His coming may receive His own with usury.</p>
      <p>We hear much of the higher education as the world regards the subject. But those who are ignorant of the higher
          education as it was taught and exempliﬁed in the life of Christ, are ignorant of what constitutes the higher
          education. Higher education means conformity to the terms of salvation. It embraces the experience of daily
          looking unto Jesus, and of working together with Christ for the saving of the perishing.</p>
      <p>Idleness is sin, for there is a world to be labored for. Christ gave His life to the work of uplifting the
          fallen and the sinful. Though He was the Prince of heaven, He lived and suffered and died under the abuse and
          scorn of fallen men; and this that He might prepare for the human family mansions in the heavenly courts.
          Christ imparted instruction of the highest order. Can we imagine a higher education than that to be gained in
          cooperation with Him?</p>
      <p>Now is our time to work. The end of all things is at hand; soon the night cometh in which no man can work. This
          night is much nearer than many suppose. Lift up the man of Calvary before those who are living in sin. By pen
          and voice labor to sweep back the false ideas that have taken possession of men’s minds regarding the higher
          education. To every worker Christ gives the command, Go work today in My vineyard for the glory of My name.
          Represent before a world laden with corruption the blessedness of true higher education. Light is to shine
          forth from every believer. The weary, the <nobr>heavy-laden,</nobr> the <nobr>broken-hearted,</nobr> and the
          perplexed, are to be pointed to Christ, the source of all spiritual life and strength....</p>
      <p>Seek for the higher education, which is entire conformity to the will of God, and you will surely reap the
          reward that comes as the result of its reception. When you hourly place yourselves in that position where you
          can be the recipients of the blessing of God, the name of the Lord will be magniﬁed through your
          <nobr>lives.—Letter</nobr> 102, June 8, 1909„ to E. A. Sutherland and P. T. Magan, educators formerly at
          Battle Creek and Berrien Springs, but now at the school at Madison, Tennessee.</p>
