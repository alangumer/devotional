    <h1>Unreserved Surrender</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am cruciﬁed with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which
          I now live in the ﬂesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Galatians
          2:20.</strong></p>
      <p>God will accept nothing less than unreserved surrender. <nobr>Half-hearted,</nobr> sinful Christians can never
          enter heaven. There they would ﬁnd no happiness; for they know nothing of the high, holy principles that
          govern the members of the royal family.</p>
      <p>The true Christian keeps the windows of the soul open heavenward. He lives in fellowship with Christ. His will
          is conformed to the will of Christ. His highest desire is to become more and more Christlike....</p>
      <p>Earnestly and untiringly we are to strive to reach God’s ideal for us. Not as a penance are we to do this, but
          as the only means of gaining true happiness. The only way to gain peace and joy is to have a living connection
          with Him who gave His life for us, who died that we might live, and who lives to unite His power with the
          efforts of those who are striving to overcome.</p>
      <p>Holiness is constant agreement with God. Shall we not strive to be that which Christ so greatly desires us to
          <nobr>be—Christians</nobr> in deed and in <nobr>truth—that</nobr> the world may see in our lives a revelation
          of the saving power of truth? This world is our preparatory school. While here we shall meet with trials and
          difﬁculties. Continually the enemy of God will seek to draw us away from our allegiance. But while we cleave
          to Him who gave Himself for us, we are safe.</p>
      <p>The whole world was gathered into the embrace of Christ. He died on the cross to destroy him who had the power
          of death, and to take away the sin of every believing soul. He calls upon us to offer ourselves on the altar
          of service, a living, consuming sacriﬁce. We are to make an unreserved consecration to God of all that we have
          and are.</p>
      <p>In this lower school of earth we are to learn the lessons that will prepare us to enter the higher school,
          where our education will continue under the personal instruction of Christ. Then He will open to us the
          meaning of His Word. Shall we not, in the few days of probation remaining to us, act like men and women who
          are seeking for life in the kingdom of God, even an eternity of <nobr>bliss?—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May
          16, 1907.</p>
