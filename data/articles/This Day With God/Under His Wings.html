    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. John 15:20. There is no greater evidence that
          Satan is working than that those who</strong></p>
      <p>profess to be sanctiﬁed to God’s service persecute their fellow beings because they do not believe the same
          doctrine that they themselves believe. These will rush with fury against God’s people, stating as true that
          which they know to be untrue. Thus they show that they are inspired by him who is an accuser of the brethren,
          and a murderer of the saints of God. But if God permits tyrants to do with us as the priests did with His Son,
          shall we give up our faith, and go back to perdition? It is not because God does not care for us that He
          permits these things to be; for He declares, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints”
          (Psalm 116:15).</p>
      <p>With Satan at their head to imbue them with his spirit, men may afﬂict God’s people, they may cause pain to the
          body, they may take away their temporal life, but they cannot touch the life that is hid with Christ. We are
          not our own. Soul and body, we have been bought with the price paid on the cross of Calvary; and we are to
          remember that we are in the hands of Him who created us. Whatever Satan may inspire evil men to do, we are to
          rest in the assurance that we are under God’s charge, and that by His Spirit He will strengthen us to
          endure....</p>
      <p>The time is soon to come when the Lord will say, “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
          doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold,
          the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
          shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain” (Isaiah 26:20, 21).</p>
      <p>Those who love God need not be surprised if those who claim to be Christians are ﬁlled with hatred because they
          cannot force the consciences of God’s people. Not long hence they will stand before the Judge of all the
          earth, to render an account for the pain they have caused to the bodies and souls of God’s
          <nobr>heritage.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 28, 1897.</p>
