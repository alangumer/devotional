      <p><strong>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.
          Psalm 27:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Be of good courage, my sister. A little longer, and we shall see Jesus. “Let not your heart be troubled,” He
          said to His disciples: “ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it
          were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you,
          I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also” (John
          <nobr>14:1-3).</nobr></p>
      <p>Encourage your heart in the Lord. I rejoice in the bright prospects of the future, and so may you. Let us be
          cheerful, and praise the Lord for His <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> to the children of men. Do not look on the
          dark side. Have faith in God. We are Christ’s property, and let us remember that He loves us, and will be our
          Helper and our God.</p>
      <p>Last night I was awake for a long time. I was troubled and anxious; for I knew that some were tempted and
          tried, and I was wondering how I could help them to look to Jesus and comfort their hearts in His love. I
          thought, If I could only take hold of Christ’s hand and hear His voice, as I lie awake, praying for myself,
          and much more for others who are tempted and tried! I could not sleep after one o’clock. I was so sorry,
          because I had writing that I wanted to do today, and I thought that I would be useless if I could not sleep.
          But at two o’clock I arose and dressed, made my ﬁre, and before breakfast had written many pages. I have
          written many pages since breakfast, and have not felt sleepy at all.</p>
      <p>Let us be thankful for every favor. Let us try to be sunshiny Christians. The souls that I trouble about,
          fearing that they will not hold fast till the end, I will commit to God. That which is divinely real will
          shine amidst the moral darkness, because Christ’s light shines upon it. To Him we owe constant praise and
          thanksgiving; for we are kept by His power through faith. We cannot keep ourselves.</p>
      <p>Be of good courage. The Lord loves you, and pities your every weakness. He will certainly strengthen and bless
          you, if you will only trust Him. It would not satisfy the heart of the inﬁnite God to give to those who love
          His Son a less blessing than He gives His <nobr>Son.—Letter</nobr> 57, February 5, 1905„ to Mrs. A. J. Breed,
          a minister’s wife.</p>
