      <p><strong>His Lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few
          things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew
          25:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Oh, how many are waiting for opportunity to do some great work of <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> and are
          overlooking the little daily test which God gives to prove them. It is the little things of life that develop
          the spirit in men and women and determine that character. These triﬂes cannot be neglected and yet the man be
          prepared to endure the severe tests, when they are brought to bear upon him....</p>
      <p>Your character building is by no means ﬁnished. Every day a good or a bad brick is placed in the structure. You
          are either building crookedly, or with exactness and correctness that will make a beautiful temple for God.
          Therefore, look not for great opportunities, and neglect the present little opportunities of doing little acts
          of kindness. In words, in tones, in gestures, in looks, you can represent the spirit of Jesus. He who neglects
          these little things, and yet ﬂatters himself that he is ready to do wonderful things for the Master, will be
          in danger of failing altogether.</p>
      <p>Life is not made up of great sacriﬁces and wonderful achievements, but of little things. Kindness and love and
          courtesy are the marks of the Christian....</p>
      <p>You need to cherish the precious qualities that existed in the character of Jesus....</p>
      <p>In our association with each other, let it be ever remembered that there are chapters in the experience of
          others that are sealed from mortal eyes. There are sad histories that are written in the books of heaven,
          which are sacredly guarded from prying eyes. There stand registered long, hard battles with trying
          circumstances, arising in the very homes, that day by day sap the courage, the faith, the conﬁdence, until the
          very manhood seems to fall to ruins. But Jesus knows it all, and He never forgets. To such, words of kindness
          and of affection are welcome as the smile of angels. A strong, helpful grasp of the hand of a true friend is
          worth more than gold and silver. It helps him to regain the manhood of the <nobr>man.—Letter</nobr> 16, May
          15, 1886„ to two physicians at the St. Helena Sanitarium.</p>
