    <h1>Consciousness of Sins Forgiven</h1>

      <p><strong>He must increase, but I must decrease. John 3:30.</strong></p>
      <p>I feel very sad when I see the want of practical religion in our very midst. Self is largely exhibited and the
          spirit of Christ is not discerned. We need the divine enlightenment. We want every day to renew our
          consecration to God.</p>
      <p>Why do we not have the consciousness of sins forgiven? It is because we are unbelieving. We are not practicing
          the teachings of Christ and bringing His virtues into our lives. Should the joy and exaltation and hope
          imparted by the Lord Jesus Christ be given to many of us, it would administer to <nobr>self-esteem</nobr> and
          pride. When Jesus is abiding in the heart by faith, the lessons which Christ has given us will be practiced.
          We will have such exalted views of Jesus Christ that self will be abased. Our affections will center in Jesus,
          our thoughts will be strongly drawn heavenward. Christ will increase, I will decrease.</p>
      <p>The mind must be trained to dwell upon heavenly things. Humility will come as the result of discerning the
          loveliness of Jesus Christ. Dwelling upon Christ’s excellencies of character, we shall see the offensive
          character of sin and will by faith grasp the righteousness of Jesus Christ. We will cultivate the virtues that
          dwell in Jesus, that we may reﬂect to others a representation of His character. When we look at the cross of
          Calvary, we will not exalt self, but keep constantly in view our unworthiness and how much our salvation cost
          heaven; we will discern Christ’s matchless love.</p>
      <p>Many allow their minds to dwell upon their unworthiness as though this was a virtue. It is a hindrance to their
          coming to Jesus in full assurance of faith. They should feel their unworthiness, and because of
          <nobr>this—because</nobr> of their <nobr>sinfulness—should</nobr> feel the necessity of coming to the Saviour,
          who is their worthiness and who will be their righteousness if they repent and humble themselves. Their
          unworthiness is a <nobr>self-evident</nobr> fact. Jesus Christ’s worthiness is a sure thing. Then let every
          doubting soul take hope and courage, because he has One who is worthy to be his Saviour. His only hope of
          salvation is to lay hold by faith of a worthiness which he has not but which will be supplied by Jesus Christ
          our <nobr>righteousness.—Manuscript</nobr> 21, September 9, 1889„ diary.</p>
