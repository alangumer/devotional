    <h1>Power to Overcome</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that
          asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. 1 Peter 3:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The times in which we now live call for <nobr>whole-souled</nobr> helpers. The practical character of the
          doctrines which we profess will make an impression upon hearts, for heavenly messengers cooperate with the
          worker whose faith and works are combined. He who has a vital connection with Jesus Christ, will have a
          testimony to bear as a witness for the Master. “Ye are my friends,” said Christ, “if ye do whatsoever I
          command you” (John 15:14).</p>
      <p>All who in truth are friends of Christ will do the works of Christ. We are so inclined to bring unsanctiﬁed,
          unconverted traits of character into our family government and into the church, and these make our words, our
          manner, and our spirit, not only an offense in the home, but also to the church and to the whole heavenly
          universe. God calls it a perverse spirit.</p>
      <p>If all could see how God regards the selﬁsh, pettish disposition, they would thoroughly despise themselves, and
          would make decided efforts to cut away from them every disagreeable action. The idea that men can unite with
          the family of God with all their disagreeable traits of character unchanged in this life is the greatest
          deception and delusion.</p>
      <p>The power to overcome depends, not on circumstances, not on any man living, however learned he may be, but on
          the ever present help which God supplies. The truth is not something to be kept bottled up for private
          occasions. If the truth is in the heart the receiver will reveal that faith that works by love, and puriﬁes
          the soul. Its abiding principles in the heart will be manifested at all times and on all occasions....</p>
      <p>All our success, all our efﬁciency, is in Christ. We must continually look above earthly help, higher than the
          greatest human power, higher than the apostles. We must fasten our faith directly upon Christ Himself. He has
          declared, “Without me ye can do nothing” (Verse 5). “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear
          fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me” (Verse
          <nobr>4).—Manuscript</nobr> 114, October 7, 1897„ “To the Faithful in Christ Jesus.”</p>
