    <h1>Rejoice in the Lord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we walk by faith, not by sight. 2 Corinthians 5:7.</strong></p>
      <p>My head is weary this morning. Mist and clouds hang over my mind; but the suggestions of the enemy to distrust
          the Lord shall not be cherished. Now is my time to ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. Now is the very occasion that
          needs the steady faith that works by love and puriﬁes my soul. I seek the Lord more earnestly.</p>
      <p>In 1 Chronicles 28:9 David gives his charge to Solomon....</p>
      <p>The message was brought to Asa by the Lord’s prophet: “The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye
          seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you” (2 Chronicles 15:2; cf.
          Jeremiah <nobr>29:11-13).</nobr> My heart goes out in faith. Faith is not feeling; faith is not sight. “Faith
          is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).</p>
      <p>I spoke in the Rechabite’s hall at 3:00 P.M. from Philippians <nobr>4:4-7:</nobr> “Rejoice in the Lord alway:
          and again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for
          nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
          God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
          Jesus.” I believe the promise is for me, and I appropriate the same personally. The promise itself is of no
          value unless I fully believe that He that has made the promise is abundantly able to fulﬁll, and inﬁnite in
          power to do all that He has said.</p>
      <p>The message the Lord gave me was a message of faith. We cannot dishonor God more than in distrusting His Word.
          Feeling is not at all reliable. A religion fed and kept alive by emotions is valueless. God’s Word is the
          foundation upon which our hopes may safely rest, and in the conﬁdence we have in the Word of God we are
          established, strengthened, settled, riveted to the Eternal Rock. Then the prayer of Paul will be
          answered:</p>
      <p>“For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might
          be ﬁlled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy
          of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God”
          (Colossians 1:9, <nobr>10).—Manuscript</nobr> 80, May 27, 1893„ diary.</p>
