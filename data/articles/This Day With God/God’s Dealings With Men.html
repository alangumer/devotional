    <h1>God’s Dealings With Men</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of
          the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? James 2:5.</strong></p>
      <p>In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the great Teacher rolls back the curtain, showing that God is the
          foundation of all faith, all goodness, all <nobr>mercy.—Manuscript</nobr> 81, June 23, 1898„ “The Rich Man and
          Lazarus.”</p>
      <p>The Jews claimed to have descended from Abraham, but by failing to do the works of Abraham, they proved that
          they were not true children of his. Only those who are spiritually in harmony with him are reckoned as true
          descent. Christ recognized the beggar [Lazarus] as one whom Abraham will take into the very heart of
          friendship, although he belonged to a class looked upon by men as inferior.</p>
      <p>Human sympathy should be cherished in every heart. It is an attribute of God, and is never to be banished. “All
          ye are brethren” (Matthew 23:8). God has laid upon men the responsibility of giving sympathy to their fellow
          men, of helping the needy, the wounded, the bruised. Many are demoralized by their own course of action, but
          who of the human family can understand, as God understands, the cause of their misery?</p>
      <p>There are in our world today many wounded, cheerless hearts who need relief. The Lord has agencies for
          brightening the lives of these disconsolate ones. We may each put our talents out to usury by lifting the
          clouds, and letting in the sunlight of hope and faith in Him who “so loved the world, that he gave his only
          begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).</p>
      <p>Christ has shown us that there is a time coming when the positions of the rich who have not made God their
          dependence, and the poor who have made God their dependence, will be reversed. Those who are poor in this
          world’s goods, yet who are patient in suffering, and who trust in God, will one day be exalted above many of
          those who hold the highest positions this world can give.</p>
      <p>The Lord deals not with us as men deal. He gave His Son at an immense sacriﬁce, that He might win us to His
          service, and with Him He gave all heaven. This He did to show the estimate He placed on the beings He had
          <nobr>created.—Ibid.</nobr></p>
