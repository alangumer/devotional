    <h1>Cultivate Christlike Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they
          speak no guile. 1 Peter 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The Christian parent should never lose the sense that he is one of God’s little children, and that he is to
          cultivate a courteous, compassionate disposition, because he is an educator. He is to represent Jesus to his
          children. In his dealing with them, there is to be seen no impetuosity, and neither is there to be seen the
          cold, icy dignity that freezes love in the heart. He is to be so kind, so tender, that the hearts of the
          children will be softened and subdued, prepared to receive the love and grace of Christ. No harsh words are to
          be spoken by a Christian to any one, old or young. Such words are prompted by the enemy....</p>
      <p>We are taught in the Word of God to be kind, tender, pitiful, courteous. Cultivate Christlike love. Let all
          that you do bear the impress of this love. Those who do not speak the words and do the works of Christ are
          trying to climb into heaven by some other way than through the door....</p>
      <p>Do not endeavor to preserve your cold, <nobr>un-Christlike</nobr> dignity. This is not religion; it is not
          Christianity. What you need is the light that shines in the face of Christ to cause your faces to shine with
          the brightness of His love. Put away your <nobr>cast-iron</nobr> dignity. God has not told you to cherish any
          such thing. Let your hearts be ﬁlled with the love of Christ. Then Christlike sympathy will shine forth from
          your faces....</p>
      <p>There are some serving in holy things who have no faith in God or His power. They multiply their efforts to
          gain salvation by their own devices. How pitiful are their vain endeavors to justify themselves, and to hold
          their footing against the downward current of evil. They are powerless; for they do not make God their
          trust....</p>
      <p>God is the eternal, uncreated fountain of all good. All who look to Him and trust in Him ﬁnd Him to be this. To
          those who serve Him, cleaving to Him as their heavenly Father, He gives the assurance that He will fulﬁl His
          promises. His joy will be in their hearts, and their joy will be <nobr>full.—Letter</nobr> 203, September 14,
          1903„ “To Those in Positions of Responsibility in Nashville Publishing House.”</p>
