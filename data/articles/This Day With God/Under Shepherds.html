    <h1>Under Shepherds</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall feed his ﬂock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
          bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. Isaiah 40:11.</strong></p>
      <p>In the visible creation, divine wisdom is manifested in an endless variety of processes. Uniformity is not the
          rule that is followed in the kingdom of nature. Neither is it the rule that is followed in the kingdom of
          grace. In different ways God works to attain one <nobr>purpose—the</nobr> saving of souls. By different
          methods the gracious Redeemer deals with different minds. The change of heart is as truly wrought out by one
          process as by another. It is the Lord working upon minds and molding characters.</p>
      <p>All are not led to the Lord in precisely the same way. Human beings are not to deﬁne, arbitrarily and narrowly,
          the characteristics of God’s working on minds. It may be given to one to gain spiritual strength and
          discernment easily, while another has to contend with “a thorn in the ﬂesh” (2 Corinthians 12:7), and at times
          is ready, apparently, to step off the heights over the precipice. Yet who dare say that God does not still
          love and regard as His child the one so sorely beset, and that His hand is not still stretched out to
          save?</p>
      <p>The heavenly Shepherd knows where to ﬁnd the lambs that are straying from the fold. He will gather them in. He
          calls upon ministers and lay members to arouse to their responsibility, and unite with Him in this work. It is
          the special duty of Christians to seek and save the lost. Ministers and laymen are to encourage and help those
          who, sorely beset by temptation, know not which way to turn. My brother, through the grace of God you may
          become one who is able to bring back to the fold the wandering ones.</p>
      <p>As in the days of Elijah, God had seven thousand who had not bowed the knee to Baal, so today He has in the
          world many who are walking in all the light they have received. A whole ﬁrmament of chosen ones has He in
          reserve, that will yet shine forth amidst the darkness. In places where there might be expected only briars
          and thorns, <nobr>fruit-bearing</nobr> trees of righteousness will appear. In such places as these there are
          those who will bloom more sweetly for the Lord than many who live in more favored places. All around them they
          will shed the fragrance of His grace as they bloom in most unpromising <nobr>places.—Letter</nobr> 39,
          February 28, 1903„ to J. Wessells.</p>
