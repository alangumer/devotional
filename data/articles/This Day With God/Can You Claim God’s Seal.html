    <h1>Can You Claim God’s Seal?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. Psalm 78:1.</strong></p>
      <p>We have a message to bear to those who have not had the light of present truth; and in our work we must make no
          denial of our faith. A study of the history of the children of Israel will help us to learn lessons that will
          keep us from repeating the mistakes that spoiled their record. The Lord wonderfully delivered this people from
          their bondage to an oppressive king, and Himself took charge of their vast army. He guided them by a pillar of
          cloud by day, and a pillar of ﬁre by <nobr>night—a</nobr> cloud which enshrouded His own presence. He provided
          them with food in the wilderness; and men did eat angels’ food....</p>
      <p>Soon after Israel’s encampment at Sinai, Moses was called up into the mount to meet with God. Alone he climbed
          the steep and rugged path, and drew near to the cloud that marked the place of Jehovah’s presence. Israel was
          now to be taken into close and peculiar relationship to the Most High God. As a nation they were to come under
          the special government of God....</p>
      <p>Amid thunders and lightnings God spoke His law in the hearing of that vast multitude. God gave the occasion of
          the giving of the law one of awful grandeur. He desired that the people should understand the exalted
          character of His law. The people must be taught that everything connected with His service must be regarded
          with the greatest reverence....</p>
      <p>The time left to us is very short. Let us put away all selﬁsh indulgence; for this weakens the physical,
          mental, and moral strength, and makes the human agent unable to have a true sense of the sacredness of God’s
          requirements....</p>
      <p>Can you claim the seal of the living God? Can you claim that you are sanctiﬁed by the truth? We have not, as a
          people, given the law of God the preeminence as we should. We are in danger of doing our own pleasure on the
          Sabbath day.</p>
      <p>Precious instruction has been given to our people in the books I have been charged to write. How many read and
          study these books? The light that God has given may be regarded with indifference and unbelief, but this light
          will condemn all who have not chosen to accept and obey <nobr>it.—Letter</nobr> 258, August 16, 1907„ to Edson
          and Emma White.</p>
