    <h1>Triumph of the Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity,
          sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned. Titus 2:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>The triumph of the truth is dependent on the inﬂuence of those who believe it. By personal labor, by a
          <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life, by piety, faith, and tender compassion, we are to advance the truth. We have a
          heaven to win. The highest rewards are presented to the overcomer. Yes, an eternal weight of glory is held out
          before us to induce us to so run that we may obtain the crown of life that fadeth not away.</p>
      <p>He who determines to overcome has a warfare before him from which there is no release. Manfully he is to ﬁght
          the good ﬁght of faith. Lawfully he is to strive, day by day seeking for purity and moral excellence. This God
          requires him to do that he may represent Christ. He is to believe the promises of God, and trust in Christ,
          showing those around him that he has an inexhaustible treasure from which to draw. His words are to be right
          words, his spirit the right spirit. His hands are never to grow weak in doing the work God has given him to
          do. He will meet with trials, but he must always be brave and cheerful. He is to treat all as the purchase of
          the blood of Christ, without partiality and without hypocrisy. The Holy Spirit is his helper. Through Christ,
          who strengthens him, he is enabled to bear all things....</p>
      <p>The talents God has entrusted will call for proportionate returns. God accepts “according to that a man hath,
          and not according to that he hath not” (2 Corinthians 8:12). He does not expect from the man who has only one
          talent that which He expects from him who has ﬁve. If the wealthy choose to gratify every selﬁsh desire, to
          enjoy the good things of this life, they will be judged accordingly. They refuse to honor Christ by humble
          obedience, to lift His cross. They live to please and gratify self, and thus dishonor God; and He declares,
          “Them that honour me I will honour” (1 Samuel 2:30)....</p>
      <p>Only those who trade faithfully upon their talents, with a solemn sense of their responsibility, do a great
          work, because of their steadfast faithfulness....</p>
      <p>Only those who glorify Him by wisely improving the gifts lent them by aiding the cause of God, are great in His
          <nobr>sight.—Manuscript</nobr> 53, April 3, 1899„ “Words of Instruction to Those Connected With the
          Sanitarium.”</p>
