    <h1>Fidelity in Service</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself
          to him that judgeth righteously. 1 Peter 2:23.</strong></p>
      <p>I hope that you will not become impatient by criticism and faultﬁnding; but if it comes, consider that you are
          not perfect, that errors are liable to occur, and that many mistakes made in a lifetime occasion suspicion,
          although the very ones who criticize have similar errors in their experience. Many do not think of this, and
          as a result they are unmerciful to others, judging others by themselves, to have the same or worse weaknesses
          than they themselves have. But we must individually preserve a course above retaliation.</p>
      <p>We shall show the greatest wisdom as we pass along, doing our work with ﬁdelity, not swerving to the right hand
          or to the left, keeping a straightforward course, having our eye single to the glory of God. It is not how
          much feeling we manifest over injustice in treatment that evidences strength of character, but it is the
          <nobr>self-control,</nobr> the ﬁrm check put upon a strong emotion, that evidences strength of character and
          the spirit of Jesus. The tree of life in the midst of the paradise of God is to be given to the overcomer. It
          is the reward given to conquest, to toil and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> to the working Christian who will
          ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith. We must be nobly striving and ﬁghting for the victory. The grace of Christ will
          be given to all who ﬁght lawfully.</p>
      <p>Now, my son [Edson], take as little notice as possible of what people say. Let them say what they will, but do
          not by word or deportment show the rising up of self. The Lord would have you pursue such a course that you
          will be considered worthy of trust and conﬁdence. You have abilities calculated to do good to others if you do
          not allow yourself to be carried away by impulse. If you evidence that you have a ﬁrm reliance upon God, you
          will gain respect and conﬁdence and then you will exert an inﬂuence for good. You will let your light shine
          forth to the best advantage. You will seek to represent Jesus. You know our Saviour was reviled, but He
          reviled not again. He was despised and rejected of men; and can His followers expect anything better in this
          life? May our gracious heavenly Father impart to each of us more grace and may we rejoice in His
          <nobr>love.—Letter</nobr> 99, June 18, 1886„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
