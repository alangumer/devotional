    <h1>God’s Goodness Displayed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should
          shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter
          2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>As the wax takes the counterpart of the seal, so the soul receives and retains the moral image of God. We
          become ﬁlled and transﬁgured by beholding His purity and righteousness. Our souls will become sluggish and our
          faith enfeebled unless we arouse and have a ﬁrm, steady, active faith....</p>
      <p>The great sin of God’s people at the present time is, we do not appreciate the value of the blessings God has
          bestowed upon us. We serve God with a divided heart. We cherish some idol and worship at its shrine. The truth
          of God is elevated and holy, sanctifying the soul, if brought into the life and interwoven with the character.
          God is seeking with His truth to make us a separate and peculiar people. This is the inﬂuence of the truth.
          Our obedience and devotion are not equal to our light and privileges, and the sacred obligations resting upon
          us to walk as children of the light are not fulﬁlled by us. As Christians we fail to come up to our high
          calling. Warnings and reproofs have been given us from God but only for a time have an inﬂuence upon us
          because we do not consider it as our lifework to press forward and upward to the mark of the prize of the high
          calling in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Oh, that God’s people would consider their superior advantages, and understand from the light of God’s Word
          that we must be judged according to the light that shine upon our pathway. All the privileges and
          opportunities given us of God are for the purpose of making us better men and women. The people of God must
          move from a settled principle, making it their ﬁrst principle to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness
          and then go on from light to still greater light....</p>
      <p>Every soul who really believes the Word of God will show the same by his works. The great goodness of God is
          displayed in His will. Whatever His will or Word requires them to do they cannot be Christians if they neglect
          to do this. The truth is able to save our souls, for God by His own Spirit is a continual agent in it, and the
          divine agency makes the truth a sanctifying <nobr>power.—Letter</nobr> 8, February 11, 1887„ to Brother and
          Sister Lockwood.</p>
