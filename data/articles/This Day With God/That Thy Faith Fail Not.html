    <h1>That Thy Faith Fail Not</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. Psalm
          34:2.</strong></p>
      <p>When, as you labor for the salvation of souls, sinners are convicted of their sins and you have evidence that
          Christ has had compassion on them, that new hope is springing up in their hearts, it is not correct to say,
          “We prayed for him, and he gave his heart to God and was saved.” This is misleading. It is their privilege to
          say, solemnly, seriously, gladly, “I believe that Jesus Christ has forgiven my sins.” Encourage every soul to
          have hope and faith, but never ...say of any man, “He is saved.” ...</p>
      <p>Patient, pitying tenderness is to be exercised toward the erring, to bring back the wandering sheep. We have an
          example of this in Christ’s treatment of Peter who denied his Lord with cursing and swearing. Peter thought
          himself strong. He said, “Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake” (John
          13:37). But Jesus answered him, “Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock
          crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice” (Mark 14:30). But Peter “spake the more vehemently, If I should die
          with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise” (Verse 31).</p>
      <p>It is not wise to boast. Peter fell because he did not know his own frailty....</p>
      <p>The Lord had said to Peter, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as
          wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy
          brethren” (Luke 22:31, 32).</p>
      <p>If Satan had been suffered to have his way, there would have been no hope for Peter. He would have made
          complete shipwreck of faith. Had Peter earnestly and in humility looked for divine help, had he been searching
          his own heart in secret, he would not have been sifted when tried. Satan cannot overcome the humble learner of
          Christ, he who walks prayerfully before the Lord. “When the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood, the Spirit of the
          Lord shall lift up a standard” for him against the enemy (Isaiah 59:19). Christ interposes Himself as a
          shelter, a retreat, and the wicked one cannot overcome <nobr>Him.—Manuscript</nobr> 109, September 8, 1898„
