    <h1>How to Keep Love Alive</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
          submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. Ephesians 5:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>How much trouble and what a tide of woe and unhappiness would be saved if men, and women also, would continue
          to cultivate the regard, attention, and kind words of appreciation and little courtesies of life which kept
          love alive, and which they felt were necessary in gaining the companions of their choice. If the husband and
          wife would only continue to cultivate these attentions which nourish love, they would be happy in each other’s
          society and would have a sanctifying inﬂuence upon their families. They would have in themselves a little
          world of happiness and would not desire to go outside this world for new attractions and new objects of
          love....</p>
      <p>If the hearts were kept tender in our families, if there were a noble, generous deference to each other’s
          tastes and opinions, if the wife were seeking opportunities to express her love by actions in her courtesies
          to her husband, and the husband manifesting the same consideration and kindly regard for the wife, the
          children would partake of the same spirit. The inﬂuence would pervade the household, and what a tide of misery
          would be saved in families! Men would not go from home to ﬁnd happiness; and women would not pine for love,
          and lose courage and <nobr>self-respect,</nobr> and become lifelong invalids. Only one life lease is granted
          us, and with care, painstaking, and <nobr>self-control</nobr> it can be made endurable, pleasant, and even
          happy.</p>
      <p>Every couple who unite their life interest should seek to make the life of each as happy as possible. That
          which we prize we seek to preserve and make more valuable, if we can. In the marriage contract men and women
          have made a trade, an investment for life, and they should do their utmost to control their words of
          impatience and fretfulness, even more carefully than they did before their marriage, for now their destinies
          are united for life as husband and wife, and each is valued in exact proportion to the amount of painstaking
          and effort put forth to retain and keep fresh the love so eagerly sought for and prized before
          <nobr>marriage.—Letter</nobr> 27, November 22, 1872„ to Brother Burton, an early church member in San
          Francisco, California.</p>
