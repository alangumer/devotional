      <p><strong>Conﬁrming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must
          through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Acts 14:22.</strong></p>
      <p>God means we shall trust in Him and enjoy His goodness. He lays out day by day before us and we must have eyes
          and perceptive powers to take these things in. However great and glorious the full and perfect deliverance
          from evil we shall realize in heaven, it is not all to be kept for the time of ﬁnal deliverance. God brings it
          into our present life. We need daily to cultivate faith in a present Saviour. Trusting in a power out of and
          above ourselves, exercising faith in unseen support and power which is waiting the demand of the needy and
          dependent, we can trust amid clouds as well as sunshine, singing of present deliverance and present enjoyment
          of His love. The life we now live must be by faith in the Son of God.</p>
      <p>The Christian’s life is a strangely mingled scene of sorrows and joys, disappointments and hopes, fears and
          conﬁdence. There will be much dissatisfaction with self, as he views his own heart so deeply stirred, surged
          with passion that seems to bear all before it, and then follows remorse and sorrow and repentance, followed by
          peace and deep hidden joys, because he knows, as his faith grasps the promises that are revealed in God’s
          Word, that he has the forgiving love of a longsuffering Saviour. And that Saviour, he seeks to bring into his
          life, weave into his character.</p>
      <p>It is these revealings, these discoveries of God’s goodness, that make the soul humble and lead it to cry out
          in gratitude, “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me” (Galatians 2:20). We have reason to be comforted.
          Severe outward trials may press around the soul where Jesus lives. Let us turn to Him for the consolations He
          has provided for us in His Word. The nether springs of hope and comfort may appear to fail us, but the upper
          springs which feed the river of God are full of supply and can never be dried up. God would have you look away
          from the cause of your afﬂictions to Him who is the Owner of soul, body, and spirit. He is the lover of the
          soul. He knows the value of the soul. He is the true Vine and we are the branches. We shall have no spiritual
          nourishment only as we draw it from Jesus who is the life of the <nobr>soul.—Letter</nobr> 10, February 23,
          1887„ to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.</p>
