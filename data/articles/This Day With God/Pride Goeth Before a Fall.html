    <h1>Pride Goeth Before a Fall</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 1 Corinthians 10:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Just before Peter’s fall, Christ said to him, “Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
          you as wheat” (Luke 22:31).</p>
      <p>How true was the Saviour’s friendship for Peter! how compassionate His warning! But the warning was resented.
          In <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> Peter declared conﬁdently that he would never do what Christ had warned him
          against. “Lord,” he said, “I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death” (Verse 33). His
          <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> proved his ruin. He tempted Satan to tempt him, and he fell under the arts of the
          wily foe. When Christ needed him most, he stood on the side of the enemy, and openly denied his Lord....</p>
      <p>Many today stand where Peter stood, when in <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> he declared that he would not deny his
          Lord. And because of their <nobr>self-sufﬁciency,</nobr> they fall an easy prey to Satan’s devices. Those who
          realize their weakness trust in a power higher than self. And, while they look to God, Satan has no power
          against them. But those who trust in self are easily defeated. Let us remember that, if we do not heed the
          cautions that God gives us, a fall is before us. Christ will not save from wounds the one who places himself
          unbidden on the enemy’s ground. He lets the <nobr>self-sufﬁcient</nobr> one, who acts as if he knew more than
          his Lord, go on in his supposed strength. Then comes suffering and a crippled life, or perhaps defeat and
          death.</p>
      <p>In the warfare, the enemy takes advantage of the weakest points in the defence of those he is attacking. Here
          he makes his ﬁercest assaults. The Christian should have no weak points in his defence. He should be
          barricaded by the support that the Scriptures give to the one who is doing God’s will. The tempted soul will
          bear away the victory, if he follows the example of Him who met the tempter with the word, “It is written.” He
          can stand securely in the protection of a “Thus saith the Lord.” ...</p>
      <p>The Lord permits His children to fall; and then, if they repent of their wrongdoing, He helps them to stand on
          vantage ground. As ﬁre puriﬁes gold, so Christ puriﬁes His people by temptation and
          <nobr>trial.—Manuscript</nobr> 115, September 7, 1902„ “The Danger of <nobr>Self-sufﬁciency.”</nobr></p>
