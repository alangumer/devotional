      <p><strong>They received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those
          things were so. Acts 17:11.</strong></p>
      <p>My husband, Elder Joseph Bates, Father Pierce, Elder Edson, a man who was keen, noble, and true, and many
          others whose names I cannot now recall, were among those who, after the passing of the time in 1844 [October
          22], searched for truth. At our important meetings these men would meet together and search for the truth as
          for hidden treasure.</p>
      <p>I met with them, and we studied and prayed earnestly, for we felt that we must learn God’s truth. Often we
          remained together until late at night, and sometimes through the entire night, praying for light, and studying
          the Word. As we fasted and prayed, great power came upon us. But I could not understand the reasoning of the
          brethren. My mind was locked, as it were, and I could not comprehend what we were studying. Then the Spirit of
          God would come upon me, I would be taken off in vision, and a clear explanation of the passages we had been
          studying would be given me, with instruction as to the position we were to take regarding truth and duty.</p>
      <p>A line of truth extending from that time to the time when we shall enter the city of God, was plainly marked
          out before me, and I gave my brethren and sisters the instruction that the Lord had given me. They knew that,
          when not in vision, I could not understand these matters, and they accepted as light direct from Heaven the
          revelations given me. The leading points of our faith as we hold them today were ﬁrmly established. Point
          after point was clearly deﬁned, and all the brethren came into harmony.</p>
      <p>The whole company of believers were united in the truth. There were those who came in with strange doctrines,
          but we were never afraid to meet them. Our experience was wonderfully established by the revelation of the
          Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>It was some time after my second son was born [1849] that we were in great perplexity regarding certain points
          of doctrine. I was asking the Lord to unlock my mind, that I might understand His Word. Suddenly I seemed to
          be enshrouded in clear, beautiful light, and ever since, the Scriptures have been an open book to
