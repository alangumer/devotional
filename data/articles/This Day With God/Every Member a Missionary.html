      <p><strong>And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
          to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my
          salvation unto the end of the earth. Isaiah 49:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Tuesday morning, June 19. I have just looked at my watch; it is two o’clock. I dress, seek the Lord, and try to
          write a few words to go in the mail to Africa this morning. May the Lord help me in tracing each line....</p>
      <p>See Isaiah 49. I cannot write out this whole chapter. Read it carefully and solemnly. What words are these!
          “And [He] said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be gloriﬁed” (Isaiah 49:3). How many,
          after they have done their best, under most trying circumstances, suffering for the want of facilities and
          from dearth of means, are ready to say, in the words of the Scripture, “I have laboured in vain, I have spent
          my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God” (Verse
          4).</p>
      <p>All the warnings must be given. The truth, Bible truth, is to be proclaimed in our large camp meetings, and the
          churches can hear the truth. They have the opportunity. All may not desire to hear. Many oppose everything
          that calls for <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> They are not willing to accept the Sabbath. In Exodus
          <nobr>31:12-18</nobr> it is clearly marked out in deﬁnite lines what God expects from His people, and the
          decided consequence of rejecting [it] is death. Notwithstanding this, many will refuse obedience because the
          truth involves <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr></p>
      <p>Many of the ministers will not hear and be convinced. They will not enter the sanctuary of truth to receive the
          knowledge of truth from the Word, but will take away the key of knowledge from the people by perversion of the
          Scriptures, wresting the Word of God from its true meaning. Thus every step gained in reaching the people to
          save them from being lost in error and disobedience requires a hard, constant battle. But shall it stop? No.
          Lift up the standard. Plant memorials of God’s truth in every place possible, work in new territories, and
          conversions will be made. Some who do not take their stand at once will help advance the work with their means
          and their sympathy, and will themselves take their position on the Lord’s side.... God will have
          representatives in every</p>
      <p>place in all parts of the <nobr>world.—Letter</nobr> 86, June 19, 1900„ to A. G. Daniells.</p>
