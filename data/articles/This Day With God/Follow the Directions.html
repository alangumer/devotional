      <p><strong>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. John
          6:31.</strong></p>
      <p>The education of the Israelites included all their habits of life. Everything that concerned their
          <nobr>well-being</nobr> was the subject of divine solicitude, and came within the province of divine law. It
          was because the Lord desired to make them His representatives that He provided them with a special bill of
          fare. They were placed under careful restrictions in regard to their diet. The use of ﬂesh food was almost
          entirely prohibited. The people were to be holy, and the Lord knew that the use of ﬂesh meat would be a
          hindrance to their advancement in spiritual life. By a miracle of mercy He fed them with the bread of heaven.
          The food provided for them was of a nature to promote physical, mental, and moral strength, and</p>
      <p>...the wisdom of God’s choice for them was vindicated in a manner that they could not gainsay. Notwithstanding
          the hardships of their wilderness life, there was not a feeble one in all their tribes.</p>
      <p>If the Israelites had been given the diet to which they had been accustomed while in Egypt, they would have
          exhibited the unmanageable spirit that the world is exhibiting today. In the diet of men and women in this age
          there are included many things that the Lord would not have permitted the children of Israel to eat. The human
          family as it is today is an illustration of what the children of Israel would have been if God had allowed
          them to eat the food and follow the habits and customs of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>The history of the wilderness life of Israel was chronicled for the beneﬁt of the Israel of God till the close
          of time. The record of God’s dealing with the wanderers in all their marchings to and fro, in their exposure
          to hunger, thirst, and weariness, and in the striking manifestations of His power for their relief, is fraught
          with warning and instruction for His people in this age. The varied experiences of the Hebrews was a school of
          preparation for their promised home in Canaan. God would have His people review in these days, with a humble
          heart and a teachable spirit, the trials through which ancient Israel passed, that they may be instructed in
          their preparation for the heavenly <nobr>Canaan.—Letter</nobr> 44, March 9, 1903„ to Elder J. A. Burden,
          manager, Sydney Sanitarium</p>
