    <h1>Right Thinking</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be
          brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The thoughts must be trained. Gird up the loins of the mind that it shall work in the right direction, and
          after the order of <nobr>well-formed</nobr> plans; then every step is one in advance, and no effort or time is
          lost in following vague ideas and random plans. We must consider the aim and object of life, and ever keep
          worthy purposes in view. Every day the thoughts should be trained and kept to the point as the compass to the
          pole. Everyone should have his aims and purposes, and then make every thought and action of that character to
          accomplish that which he purposes. The thoughts must be controlled. There must be a ﬁxedness of purpose to
          carry out that which you shall undertake....</p>
      <p>No one but yourself can control your thoughts. In the struggle to reach the highest standard, success or
          failure will depend much upon the character, and the manner in which the thoughts are disciplined. If the
          thoughts are well girded, as God directs they shall be each day, they will be upon those subjects that will
          help us to greater devotion. If the thoughts are right, then as a result the words will be right; the actions
          will be of that character to bring gladness and comfort and rest to souls....</p>
      <p>Those who move without thoughtful consideration, move unwisely. They make ﬁtful efforts, strike out here and
          there, catch at this and that, but it amounts to nothing. They resemble the vine; its tendrils untrained and
          left to straggle out in every direction will fasten upon any rubbish within their reach; but before the vine
          can be of any use these tendrils must be broken off from the things they have grasped, and trained to entwine
          about those things which will make them graceful and well formed....</p>
      <p>By the <nobr>ever-learning</nobr> student new light, new ideas, new gems of truth will be found, and eagerly
          grasped. He thinks; the laws of the mind require him to think. The human intellect gains expansion and vigor
          and acuteness by being taxed. The mind must work or it will dwindle. It will starve unless it has fresh
          subjects to think upon. Unless it is made to think hard it will surely lose its power of
          <nobr>thinking.—Letter</nobr> 33, February 27, 1886„ to a minister working in Europe.</p>
