    <h1>Repentance and Reformation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. John 17:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord calls for a decided reformation.... My brethren, show true</p>
      <p>repentance for departure from God. Let angels and men see that there is forgiveness of sin with God.
          Extraordinary power from God must take hold of <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventist churches. Reconversion must
          take place among the members, that as God’s witnesses they may testify to the authoritative power of the truth
          that sanctiﬁes the soul....</p>
      <p>Those who are sanctiﬁed through the truth will show that the truth has worked a reformation in their lives,
          that it is preparing them for translation into the heavenly world. But so long as pride and envy and evil
          surmising predominate in the life, Christ does not rule in the heart. His love is not in the soul.</p>
      <p>In the lives of those who are partakers of the divine nature there is a cruciﬁxion of the haughty,
          <nobr>self-sufﬁcient</nobr> spirit that leads to <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> In its place the Spirit of
          Christ abides, and in the life the fruits of the Spirit appear. Having the mind of Christ, His followers
          reveal the graces of His character.</p>
      <p>Nothing short of this will make men acceptable to God. Nothing short of this will give them the pure, holy
          character that those must have who are admitted to heaven. As soon as a man puts on Christ, an evidence of the
          change wrought in him is seen in spirit and word and act. A heavenly atmosphere surrounds his soul, for Christ
          is abiding within....</p>
      <p>Oh, how few there are who reveal in their lives the principles of this life!...</p>
      <p>“Whoso eateth my ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For
          my ﬂesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth
          in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even
          he shall live by me” (John <nobr>6:54-57).</nobr></p>
      <p>Do you believe these wonderful statements? Do you receive the words of Christ? I tell you that when in truth
          you receive them, you will practice the truth in accordance with the teachings of <nobr>Christ.—Letter</nobr>
          63, April 19, 1903„ to “Our Brethren at the Medical Missionary Council.”</p>
