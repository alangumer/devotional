    <h1>To Every Man His Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and
          delivered unto them his goods. Matthew 25:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Our lifetime is precious, and every action should be considered. It has been granted us that we might, if we
          will, lay hold of it in the right spirit, accomplish a work that will be acknowledged by the Lord as good,
          enduring as eternity. It is an intensely solemn thing to live in view of the account we must render to God of
          our time, our talents, and our inﬂuence. These are precious things, talents that are not to be buried in the
          earth, but used. We are not to hide our talents, they are God’s entrusted gifts for wise improvement, that
          they may accumulate in His service, and that at His coming He may receive His own with usury.</p>
      <p>No man is called by God, in the use of the talents entrusted to him, to lay off his individual responsibility
          that another man may do his trading for him. To every man God has given his work, and man is accountable to
          God for how that work is done. The soul that accepts the great trust that God has given him, cannot transfer
          that talent to another. No man can transfer his inﬂuence to another person, to serve for him, or to be mind or
          judgment for him.</p>
      <p>We are each in the service of God. He is our Teacher, and every lesson He shall give, is to be appreciated and
          acted upon. We are not called upon to give account of our talents to man, but to God. Our mind, our judgment,
          our tact, our wisdom, all are given to us of God to be improved for Him, and it is God who will call us to
          account for the way in which we have used His gifts....</p>
      <p>The period of life in every case is beset with temptations, and it is through faith in Jesus Christ alone that
          we shall ﬁnd grace to help in every time of need. But each worker has a life to live, a character to form.
          Each period of life brings with the passing years some special opportunities for work; and each advancing year
          must be made use of, improved to the very best of human capability. This, with the aid of divine agencies,
          will show improvement, advancement onward and upward, walking step by step in a safe path
          <nobr>heavenward.—Manuscript</nobr> 28, October 4, 1896„ to “Those Concerned in Publishing Mount of
          Blessing.”</p>
