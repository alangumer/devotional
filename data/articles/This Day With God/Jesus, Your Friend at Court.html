    <h1>Jesus, Your Friend at Court</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
          not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>When we have a promise that is so rich and so full as [John <nobr>3:14-19] ...I</nobr> inquire, “What excuse
          have any of us for unbelief? What excuse have you to say, “I don’t think the Lord hears my prayer; I wish I
          could believe I was a Christian, or I wish I could have the evidence that I was a child of God”? Feelings are
          very changeable, but here are the precious words of eternal life.</p>
      <p>What is evidence? Is it a ﬂight of feeling? Is it an emotion of the heart that gives you the evidence that you
          are a child of God? But here is the precious word of eternal life and it gives us the assurance that we may
          lay hold on the hope set before us in the Gospel by living faith.</p>
      <p>We may reach up to Jesus Christ who is our Advocate in the heavenly courts. We need a friend at court. We have
          been sinning, been disobedient, been transgressors, and it is of the highest consequence to us that we have a
          Friend at court to plead our cases to the Father. He says, “If I be lifted up I will draw all men unto Me.”
          Well, will all be drawn? Christ draws but will they respond to the drawing? Will they come? The invitation
          here in Revelation is this: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And
          let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely” (Revelation
          22:17).</p>
      <p>It is not only the minister that is to say, “Come,” but let him that heareth say, “Come.” Then you must hear to
          a purpose, and as you hear the message you begin to talk it, and you say, “Come.” The coming to you is
          everything. And as you see that you may come, the privilege is so large, so undeserving, that you feel that
          you want everybody to have the same privilege with yourself, so that we are laborers together with God. That
          is our work.</p>
      <p>God says, “Come,” the Spirit says, “Come,” the Bride says, “Come,” and whosoever heareth says, “Come.” Oh, that
          more will with consistent godly life and with the words of their lips say, “Come.” ...It is not only by
          precept, but by example that you carry the living example with you that heaven is worth something, that
          Christianity is worth striving <nobr>for.—Manuscript</nobr> 10, August 2, 1891,.</p>
