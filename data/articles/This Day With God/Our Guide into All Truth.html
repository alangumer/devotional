      <p><strong>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for
          ever. John 14:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ declared that, after His ascension, He would send to His church, as His crowning gift, the Comforter,
          who was to take His place. This Comforter is the Holy <nobr>Spirit—the</nobr> soul of His life, the efﬁcacy of
          His church, the light and life of the world. With His Spirit, Christ sends a reconciling inﬂuence and a power
          to take away sin.</p>
      <p>God has instructed me to tell you and all His people to be very careful not to resist the working of the Holy
          <nobr>Spirit—the</nobr> Comforter that Christ sends. Fear to take the ﬁrst presumptuous step in resistance.
          When Christ spoke to the disciples of the Holy Spirit, He sought to uplift their thoughts and enlarge their
          expectations to grasp the highest conception of excellence. Let us strive to understand His words. Let us
          strive to appreciate the value of the wonderful gift He has bestowed on us. Let us seek for the fullness of
          the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>I see no other way for us than to heed the words of Christ, “If any man will come after me, let him deny
          himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24). These words we must obey if we gain eternal
          life. The Majesty of heaven came to this world to teach us this lesson by a life of constant
          <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> Shall we not heed His instruction?</p>
      <p>In order to be saved, we must have a full and complete experience in the things of God. The atonement for sin
          has been made by the gift of the Son of the inﬁnite God....</p>
      <p>To bring the sinner to Christ is the work of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit. The Saviour is the divine Example,
          the perfection of holiness, and He fashions the soul anew. We are privileged to receive from Christ all the
          excellence necessary for perfection of character. But in order for us to obtain this excellence, we must show
          more <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> more <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr></p>
      <p>Christ has made every provision for us to be children of God. Oh, my heart says, Praise His holy name that of
          His fullness we can receive grace for grace. Let us strive, by receiving His word, to reach the high standard
          of perfection. We are safe only when seeking the qualities that make us children of God, possessors of
          sanctiﬁed <nobr>excellence.—Letter</nobr> 155, September 5, 1902„ to Judge and Mrs. Arthur, Adventist attorney
          at the Battle Creek Sanitarium.</p>
