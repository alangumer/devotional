    <h1>If Judas Had Repented</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. John 13:18.</strong></p>
      <p>It was in the power of Christ to deliver Himself. When He spoke the words [in Gethsemane] “I am He,”
          immediately angels surrounded Him, and that throng had all the evidence they could or would have that Christ
          was the power of God. When that murderous throng was sent reeling, catching the air as for support, and
          falling heavily to the ground, it would have been an easy matter for Christ to have kept them helpless and
          prostrate, and pass out of their midst unharmed. By the ﬂashing forth of His brightness and glory He could
          have extinguished them. Judas expected this, for many a time Christ had escaped....</p>
      <p>It is not a marvel that Judas, even then, should hold on to his hatred and his purpose to the last. If then he
          had repented, if he had confessed at this last moment, if his traitor’s heart had broken, he would have
          received pardon. But satanic resistance increases in proportion to the light given and resisted. The appeals,
          the warnings of dangers and perils to come, did not change the purpose of Judas, because his heart was
          unchanged. In the face of light and evidence he determined to follow his own course, and do his own will. The
          longsuffering of Christ, the reproof kindly given, coming to him at last from the divine lips, does not break
          his stubborn heart. He hardens his heart by his long resistance. He sees where his footsteps are tending, but
          satanic agencies are all around him, and he has no power to save himself from their snare. The human
          attributes so long held, the refusal to yield to the light, now makes him blind to all consequences.</p>
      <p>Judas is not the only man who has passed over this ground....</p>
      <p>Judas was a man who possessed valuable qualities. But he was not teachable....</p>
      <p>When one has had connection with those who bear the message from heaven, and hears but does not practice the
          truth, that truth is brought down to mean nothing worthy of attention to him. Thus it was with Judas.</p>
      <p>Man must believe the truth; he must change his own course of action, coming into harmony with the light shining
          upon <nobr>him.—Manuscript</nobr> 100, September 15, 1897„ “The Arrest of Christ.”</p>
