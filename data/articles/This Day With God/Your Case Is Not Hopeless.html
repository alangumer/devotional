    <h1>Your Case Is Not Hopeless</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
          Isaiah 66:2.</strong></p>
      <p>You have been presented before me as in doubt and despair. Christ said of you as He said to Peter, “Satan hath
          desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not” (Luke
          22:31, 32). I bring to you good news; Jesus loves you, <nobr>tempest-tossed</nobr> soul. You have not made
          shipwreck of faith, although Satan has tried to make you believe that you have done this. Look and live. Come
          to Christ just as you are. Take Him as your personal Saviour.</p>
      <p>You have made mistakes, but not willfully; you were drawn away by temptation. The possession of a large amount
          of means intoxicated your mind and perverted your judgment. You did not understand how to use means wisely, to
          the glory of God. Yet you have invested means in His cause, and where it will be used to His glory. My
          brother, although you have not manifested all the wisdom that you could and should have exercised, God accepts
          all you have done with a desire to promote His glory....</p>
      <p>These words were presented to me for you: “In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that
          he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the
          sins of the people” (Hebrews 2:17), through the atonement. The repenting sinner is to believe in Christ as his
          personal Saviour. This is his only hope. He may lay hold on the merits of the blood of Christ, presenting to
          God the cruciﬁed and risen Saviour as his worthiness. Thus through Christ’s offering of Himself, the innocent
          for the guilty, every obstruction is removed, and the pardoning love of God ﬂows forth in rich streams of
          mercy to fallen man....</p>
      <p>Only come to Jesus now, while it is called today. The experience you have been passing through will prove of
          highest value to you when you yoke up with Christ, to be a laborer together with God. You have delighted in
          the truth, you have believed the truth, and you believe it still, and hope against hope because the Holy
          Spirit is striving with you.</p>
      <p>You have made crooked paths for your feet because of temptations, but resist the devil, and he will ﬂee from
          you; draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh unto <nobr>you.—Letter</nobr> 91, January 30, 1895„ to a
          <nobr>well-to-do</nobr> SDA businessman.</p>
