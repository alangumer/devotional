    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that
          ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Exodus 31:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Let every one seek the Lord for himself. Eternity is before us. You cannot afford to let another day pass
          without taking your position on the Lord’s side. Will you not act the part that God has appointed you to act
          in the closing scenes of this earth’s history?</p>
      <p>It is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the people of God who will be alive on the earth when
          past woes and celestial glory will be blended. They will walk in the light proceeding from the throne of God.
          By the means of the angels there will be constant communication between heaven and earth. And Satan,
          surrounded by evil angels, and claiming to be God, will work miracles of all kinds, to deceive, if possible,
          the very elect. God’s people will not ﬁnd their safety in working miracles; for Satan would counterfeit any
          miracle that might be worked. God’s tried and tested people will ﬁnd their power in the sign spoken of in
          Exodus <nobr>31:12-18.</nobr> They are to take their stand on the living <nobr>Word—“It</nobr> is written.”
          This is the only foundation upon which they can stand securely. Those who have broken their covenant with God
          will in that day be without hope and without God in the world.</p>
      <p>The worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by their regard for the fourth
          <nobr>commandment—since</nobr> this is the sign of His creative power, and the witness to His claim upon man’s
          reverence and homage. The wicked will be distinguished by their efforts to tear down the Creator’s memorial,
          to exalt the institution of Rome. In the issue of the contest, all Christendom will be divided into two great
          <nobr>classes—those</nobr> who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the
          beast and his image and receive his mark....</p>
      <p>Fearful tests and trials await the people of God. The spirit of war is stirring the nations from one end of the
          earth to the other. But in the midst of the time of trouble that is <nobr>coming—a</nobr> time of trouble such
          as has not been since there was a <nobr>nation—God’s</nobr> chosen people will stand unmoved. Satan and his
          angels cannot destroy them; for angels that excel in strength will protect <nobr>them.—Letter</nobr> 119,
          March 1, 1904„ to J. J. Wessells.</p>
