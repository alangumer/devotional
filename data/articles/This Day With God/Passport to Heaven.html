      <p><strong>For our light afﬂiction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the
          things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:17,
          18.</strong></p>
      <p>I address you and your children. I sympathize with you in your bereavement at this time. If I were with you, I
          could speak words of comfort to you, but as I am not, I can only trace a few lines, and let you know that I do
          not forget you in your afﬂiction....</p>
      <p>We are in the evening of this earth’s history, and we may lay away our dead, knowing that they are hid for a
          little moment until the indignation be overpast. We need not mourn for them as those who have ho hope; for
          their life is hid with Christ in God. We have every reason to rejoice....</p>
      <p>The difﬁculties which those who put on Christ and keep His commandments must undergo, are not of Christ’s
          designing. “If any man will come after me,” He says, “let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
          me” (Matthew 16:24). The duty of intelligent souls is to hold to the truth, to practice virtue. We are born
          with a disinclination to both. It is sad to ﬁnd in one’s own constitution an opposition to virtues that are
          commendable in the sight of God, as submission, charity, sweetness of spirit, and patience that will not be
          provoked. Say to yourselves, dear children, I am weakness, but God is my strength. He has given me my post of
          duty. The General whom I serve bids me be an overcomer....</p>
      <p>Let the afﬂiction that has come to your family circle be a blessing to you all. Our dear sister, your mother,
          loved Jesus. Her warfare is ended. You are to remember that she rests in hope. “When Christ, who is our life,
          shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him” (Colossians 3:4). Let the peace and comfort of the Holy
          Spirit come into your hearts. Open the door of your hearts, that Jesus may enter as an honored guest, and you
          will have a Comforter. “This is my commandment, That ye love one another” (John 15:12). Let the hearts of the
          living draw close to one another. Let each try to be a blessing to the other, and not a hindrance....</p>
      <p>Let us prepare for the coming of the Son of man. Let us be true to God, and we shall receive the crown of
          <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 10, January 26, 1898„ to Brother Hare.</p>
