    <h1>The Charming Christian</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another. Romans
          12:10.</strong></p>
      <p>We cannot set ourselves as a criterion to which others must conform. We will reveal a tenderness of heart and a
          <nobr>whole-souled</nobr> enthusiasm in promoting the happiness of all with whom we are connected. We have a
          duty to do in eliminating self from our plans and in feeling a personal responsibility to act as Christ would
          act in circumstances similar to those with which we are surrounded. Then we will impress the minds of others
          in such a way that God will be gloriﬁed.</p>
      <p>As followers of Christ we should seek to make the most favorable impression upon the minds of all we have
          connection with, of the religion we profess, and to inspire noble thoughts. Some will be affected by our
          inﬂuence through time and through eternity....</p>
      <p>If we would teach others, we ourselves must daily learn lessons from Christ. There are some who do not
          comprehend the sacredness of the work of God. Those of the least ability, the most thoughtless and even the
          indolent youth, especially demand our prayerful consideration. We need special wisdom to know how to help
          those who seem inconsiderate and thoughtless. Said David, “Thy gentleness hath made me great” (2 Samuel 22:36,
          Psalm 18:35).</p>
      <p>In the work of applying ourselves to help others, we may gain most precious victories. We must devote ourselves
          with untiring zeal, with earnest ﬁdelity, with <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and with patience to the work of
          encouraging those who need to develop. Kind, encouraging words will do wonders. There are many who, if a
          constant, cheerful effort is put forth in their behalf, without faultﬁnding or continual chiding, will show
          themselves susceptible of improvement....</p>
      <p>We are to cooperate with the Lord Jesus in restoring the inefﬁcient and the erring to intelligence and sacred
          purity. We are called by God to manifest an untiring, patient interest in the salvation of those who need
          divine polishing....</p>
      <p>God will not withhold wisdom from those who seek for it. He gives grace to one, that he in turn may impart it
          to some other needy <nobr>soul.—Letter</nobr> 94, March 11, 1905„ to Sister Josephine Gotzian, a philanthropic
          Adventist widow.</p>
