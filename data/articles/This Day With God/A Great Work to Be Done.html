    <h1>A Great Work to Be Done</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? So likewise ye,
          except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
          speak into the air. 1 Corinthians 14:8, 9.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many who have been waiting to hear the “certain sound” of the message that would meet the emergency.
          All over our land the Lord has honest souls, who are standing in uncertainty.... The message is to be
          proclaimed with</p>
      <p>sanctiﬁed ability. The word of the Lord has been spoken. God calls for sanctiﬁed hearts and lips. The messages
          of warning are to be given in the large cities, and also in the towns and villages. The men of God’s
          appointment are to be zealously at work, disposing of our books, and disseminating light. The articles in our
          papers are not to present the truth in the style of a romance, for this weakens the impression that should be
          made by the most solemn truth ever committed to mortals. They are to contain a plain, “Thus saith the Lord.”
          The message must be repeated, and Bible reasons given, not in the style of a romance, but in the style of the
          Bible. There are many who are watching for the evidence of true religion.</p>
      <p>The Lord declares, “The message is to go forth in words of solemn warning. Nothing that will hinder the clear
          presentation of the message is to be introduced into your plans. Repeat the message. The wickedness in the
          cities is increasing. The adversary has great inﬂuence over men, because My people did not open their hearts
          to realize their responsibility. Tell My people to take up their work and proclaim the message. They are to
          speak and work in the simplicity of true godliness, and My Spirit will make the impression on hearts. Let the
          true note of warning be sounded. My angel shall go before you, if you will be sanctiﬁed through the
          truth.”</p>
      <p>A great work is to be done. The truth is to be proclaimed with clear enunciation. We are to work in the
          sanctiﬁcation of the Holy Spirit, walking humbly before God. We must send messengers throughout all the
          unworked ﬁelds, and the Lord will impress hearts. The ﬁrst and second angels’ messages went with the power of
          the Spirit, and those who in their proclamation walked and worked in humility were greatly blessed. Let us all
          wake up, and with great energy take hold of the work to be <nobr>done.—Letter</nobr> 88, September 30, 1910„
          to Elder A. G. Daniells, president of the General Conference.</p>
