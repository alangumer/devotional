      <p><strong>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the
          whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. Revelation
          12:9.</strong></p>
      <p>As the Lord’s people show their determination to follow the light that the Lord has given, the enemy will bring
          all his powers to bear to discourage them. But they are not to give up because of the difﬁculties that arise
          when they try to follow the counsel of the Lord. God has given us His work to do, and if we comply with His
          requirements, we shall be blessed....</p>
      <p>The enemy is actively at work, as you will see as you travel on his territory, opening the Word of God to the
          people. As the last message of mercy is proclaimed by human lips, Satan will try to storm his way to the
          front. But he cannot prevail against Christ. As we present the truth that shows the people the evil of his
          delusions, his anger will be aroused, and he will do all in his power to hinder our efforts. But continue to
          present a “Thus saith the Lord, “remembering that God is your helper. Do not give the enemy the right of
          way....</p>
      <p>Satan was once the most glorious angel in the heavenly courts. But he allowed a desire for supremacy to take
          possession of him, and he was expelled from heaven. He came to this earth, and entered with great zeal into
          commercialism. And unless we stand loyal and true by the side of Prince Emmanuel, we shall be
          ensnared....</p>
      <p>In the future, strange things will happen. I tell you this so that you may not be surprised at what takes
          place. We shall all need to maintain a close connection with the Lord. The end is much nearer than when we
          ﬁrst believed....</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of Satan there are men who today are doing all in their power to plunge the world into
          commercial strife. Thus Satan is trying to bring about a condition of things that will make the world
          uncivilized. He desires to see strange things acted out, which God, who is too wise to err, has not ordained.
          But the Lord, yes, our God, will be Ruler of the heavens and the earth. If men and women will carry out His
          requirements, it will be seen that He is Ruler, carrying out His divine <nobr>will.—Letter</nobr> 114, October
          27, 1910„ to Elder A. G. Daniells, president of the General Conference.</p>
