      <p><strong>Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. Matthew 9:29.</strong></p>
      <p>It is our duty, as children of God, to talk faith, and not doubt. We are to be hopeful and cheerful in the
          Lord. Let us not look on the dark side of circumstances, but look up, and believe in the One whom God gave to
          the world to save us from our sins. Christ accomplishes our salvation by inspiring faith in our hearts and a
          belief in the truth. The truth makes free; and those whom the Son makes free are free indeed. Let us seek to
          honor God by revealing a constantly increasing conﬁdence in the assurance that He will accept every soul who
          serves Him in sincerity.</p>
      <p>We are the Lord’s little children, and we are to be led and upheld by Him. If we will learn lessons from the
          kindness and patience and tenderness of Jesus, we will be a blessing to all with whom we are associated. The
          Lord would have us take comfort in His promises, and praise Him much more than we do. “Whoso offereth praise
          gloriﬁeth me” (Psalm 50:23). Let us learn how to express our gratitude to God for His wonderful condescension
          and love for mankind.</p>
      <p>The only begotten Son of God consented to leave the heavenly courts and come to our world to live with an
          ungrateful people who refused His gracious mercies. He consented to live a life of poverty, and to endure
          suffering and temptation. He became a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And the Word declares, “We hid
          as it were our faces from him” (Isaiah 53:3). Of His own disciples, Peter, denied Him, and Judas betrayed Him.
          The people whom He came to bless rejected Him. They put Him to shame and caused Him untold suffering. They
          placed upon His head a crown of thorns that pierced His holy temples. They beat Him with a scourge, and then
          they nailed Him to the cross. Yet amid it all, no word of complaint escaped His lips....</p>
      <p>Christ bore all this suffering in order to obtain the right to confer eternal righteousness upon as many as
          would believe on Him. O, when I think of this, I feel that no complaint should ever escape my lips....</p>
      <p>When we are having a hard time, let us consider how much our salvation cost the God of the
          <nobr>universe.—Letter</nobr> 232, July 26, 1908„ to Brother and Sister M. Hare, workers in the Southern
          States.</p>
