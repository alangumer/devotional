    <h1>The Real Christian</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least
          is unjust also in much. Luke 16:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The real Christian is a servant of Christ. His work for Christ must be thoroughly well done. Nothing must come
          in to divert his mind from his work. Other matters can have proper attention, and yet be held subordinate, but
          Christ’s service requires the whole <nobr>man—the</nobr> heart, the mind, the soul, the strength. He will not
          accept a divided heart. He expects us to do our best. And nothing faithfully done for Him is insigniﬁcant in
          His sight....</p>
      <p>Every man is required to do the work assigned him of God. We should be willing to render small services, doing
          the things that are to be done, which someone must do, improving the little opportunities. If these are the
          only opportunities, we should still work faithfully. He who wastes hours, days, and weeks, because he is
          unwilling to do the work at hand, humble though it may be, will be called to render an account to God for his
          misspent time. If he feels that he can afford to do nothing, because he cannot obtain the desired wages, let
          him stop and think that that day, that one day, is the Lord’s. He is the Lord’s servant. He is not to waste
          His time. Let him think, I will spend that time in doing something, and will give all I earn to advance the
          work of God. I will not be counted a <nobr>do-nothing.</nobr></p>
      <p>When a man loves God supremely, and his neighbor as himself, he will not stop to inquire whether that which he
          can do is bringing in much or little. He will do the work, and accept the wages offered. He will not set the
          example of refusing a job because he cannot count upon as large wages as he thinks he should have.</p>
      <p>The Lord judges a man’s character by the principles on which he acts in dealing with his fellow men. If in
          common business transactions his principles are defective, the same will be brought into his spiritual service
          for God. The threads are woven into his whole religious life. If you have too much dignity to work for
          yourself for small wages, then work for the Master; give the proceeds into the Lord’s treasury. Make an
          offering of gratitude to God for sparing your life. But do not on any account be <nobr>idle.—Manuscript</nobr>
