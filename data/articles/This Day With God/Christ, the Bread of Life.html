    <h1>Christ, the Bread of Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in
          the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and
          not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for
          ever: and the bread that I will give is my ﬂesh, which I will give for the life of the world. John
          <nobr>6:47-51.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The question is asked, What shall we do that we might work the works of God? What shall we do to gain heaven?
          This important question is answered to all who desire to know, “This is the work of God, that ye believe on
          him whom he hath sent” (John 6:29).... “For the bread of God is he which cometh down</p>
      <p>from heaven, and giveth life unto the world” (Verse 33). “I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall
          never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst” (Verse 35).</p>
      <p>Christ gives them to understand that a man needs to be taught of God in order to comprehend these things. This
          is the cause of so much cheap knowledge of the Scriptures in the churches of today. Ministers preach only
          portions of the Word, and refuse to practice even as much as they teach. This leads to misconceptions of the
          Word and doctrine, it creates error and misinterpretations of the Scripture....</p>
      <p>We may be taught by man to see the truth clearly, but God alone can teach the heart to receive the truth
          savingly, which is to receive the Words of eternal life into good and honest hearts. The Lord is waiting
          patiently to instruct every willing soul who will be taught. The fault is not with the willing Instructor, the
          greatest Teacher the world ever knew, but it is with the learner who holds to his own impressions and ideas,
          and will not give up his human theories and come in humility to be taught. He will not allow his conscience
          and his heart to be educated, disciplined, and <nobr>trained—worked</nobr> as the husbandman works the earth,
          and as the architect constructs the building....</p>
      <p>Everyone needs to be worked, molded, and fashioned after the divine similitude. Christ tells you, my dear
          friends, young and old, the everlasting truth, “Except ye eat the ﬂesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
          ye have no life in you” (Verse 53).</p>
      <p>If you do not take Christ’s word as the man of your counsel, you will not reveal His wisdom or His spiritual
          <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 88, April 13, 1900„ to the managers and teachers in the Avondale School.</p>
