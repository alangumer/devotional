    <h1>Our Refuge and Strength</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.... The</strong></p>
      <p>Lord of hosts is with us. Psalm <nobr>46:1-11.</nobr></p>
      <p>Faith is not the ground of our salvation, but it is the great <nobr>blessing—the</nobr> eye that sees, the ear
          that hears, the feet that run, the hand that grasps. It is the means, not the end....</p>
      <p>We have every encouragement that, if we daily surrender our wills to God, the promise will be fulﬁlled, “And of
          his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace” (John 1:16). Every revealing of the grace of Christ in
          our behalf is for us. We are to reveal His grace in our lives, in thought, word, and deed. Let us not lose our
          opportunity to speak and act Christ Jesus. We are to represent the mercy, the love, and the power of
          <nobr>Christ—the</nobr> power that He has given us....</p>
      <p>Were it not for the power received through Christ, we would have no strength. But Christ has all power. “Jesus
          came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and
          teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching
          them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
          the world” (Matthew <nobr>28:18-20).</nobr></p>
      <p>Here is our power, our comfort. Of ourselves, we have no strength. But He says, “I am with you alway,” helping
          you to perform your duty, guiding, comforting, sanctifying, and sustaining you, giving you success in speaking
          words that will draw the attention of others to Christ, and awaken in their minds the desire to understand the
          hope and meaning of the truth, turning them from darkness to light and from the power of sin to God.</p>
      <p>It is a wonderful thought that human beings can speak the Word of God, in simple words of comfort and
          encouragement. The humblest instruments will be used of God to sow the seeds of truth, which may spring up and
          bear fruit, because the one in whose heart they were sown needed <nobr>help—a</nobr> kind thought, a kind
          word, made effective by the One who has said, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
          <nobr>world.”—Letter</nobr> 329a, November 16, 1905„ to her <nobr>19-year-old</nobr> granddaughter Mabel.</p>
