      <p><strong>For the weapons of our warfare are not worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy
          arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ. 2
          Corinthians 10:4, 5, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>In dealing with unreasonable and wicked men, those who believe the truth are to be careful not to bring
          themselves down to the same level, where they will use the same Satanic weapons that their enemies use, by
          giving loose rein to strong personal feelings, and arousing against themselves and against the work the Lord
          has given them to do, passion and bitter enmity. Keep Jesus uplifted. We are laborers together with God. We
          are provided with spiritual weapons, mighty to the pulling down of the strongholds of the enemy. We must in no
          case misrepresent our faith by weaving unChristlike attributes into the work. We must exalt the law of God, as
          binding us up with Jesus Christ and all who love Him and keep His commandments. We are also to reveal a love
          for the souls for whom Christ has died. Our faith is to be demonstrated as a power of which Christ is the
          Author. And the Bible, His word, is to make us wise unto salvation.</p>
      <p>Let the righteousness of Christ, with its <nobr>life-giving</nobr> inﬂuence, into the soul, and then you can
          sing, He forgiveth all our iniquities. You say, I am full of spiritual disease. The great Physician is calling
          you to come to Him, that He may heal you. He healeth all our diseases. The worst of these diseases are envy,
          jealousy, <nobr>evil-surmising,</nobr><nobr>evil-speaking,</nobr> a desire to follow plans that counterwork
          the work of God. The lives of all ought to be holy, but they are full of depravity, and because of this, men
          are easy subjects for Satan’s temptations. But if Christ abides in your heart, you can say, He redeemeth our
          life from destruction: He crowneth us with lovingkindness and tender mercy. Then let songs of praise be upon
          our lips and in our heart. Meditate upon Christ’s sufferings for us. In the place of watching to ﬁnd something
          to accuse and condemn in others, thank the Lord that there is forgiveness with Him. Christ is grieved when we
          criticize and accuse; for this is the work of Satan. Let us draw water from the wells of salvation, and praise
          the Lord.</p>
      <p>It is not sermonizing that gives evidence that the soul is born again. An appreciation of Christ’s tenderness
          toward the sheep of His pasture gives evidence of <nobr>this.—Manuscript</nobr> 46, March 31, 1898„ “The Work
          Before God’s People.”</p>
