      <p><strong>Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the ﬁrmament of his power. Praise him
          for his mighty acts: ...Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Psalm
          <nobr>150:1-6.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Yesterday at ten o’clock we reached this <nobr>place—East</nobr> Portland, Oregon. On our way from Walla Walla
          Tuesday morning the cars stopped, as they generally do, twenty minutes at Multnomah Falls. Nearly all left the
          cars to climb the high ascent to obtain a clear view of this wondrously beautiful, grand sight....</p>
      <p>There were steps built in the embankment, then a narrow zigzag path, then more wooden steps. This was repeated
          many times until we reached and passed onto a rustic bridge which spanned a chasm above the ﬁrst fall. The
          grand fall is above this and called the Bridal Veil. The point from which the water ﬂows is about 900 feet
          high. As the water descends it breaks upon the jutting rocks, scattering off in widespread, beautiful sprays.
          It is a lovely sight.</p>
      <p>I would have been pleased could I have spent an entire day in this place surrounded with lovely scenery. But we
          were grateful for these few moments to gaze upon nature’s lovely, grand scenery, even if we had to do severe
          climbing to view <nobr>it—standing</nobr> on the bridge made for this purpose....</p>
      <p>I called to mind the words of the psalmist when he calls upon everything that hath breath to praise the Lord,
          upon animate and inanimate creation to join in one chorus of praise and thanksgiving to God. His thus calling
          upon senseless, unreasoning things is the most powerful rebuke to those blessed with intelligence, if their
          souls do not glow and their lips do not proclaim the majesty and glory of God.</p>
      <p>“Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.... Praise the</p>
      <p>Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: ﬁre, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulﬁlling his
          word” (Psalm <nobr>148:3-8).</nobr> All these agencies of God in nature are summoned to bring their tribute of
          praise to the Most High. And who among God’s creatures will be silent when every star as it traverses its
          course, every breeze as it sweeps the earth, and every cloud that darkens the ﬁrmament, every shower of rain
          and every ray of <nobr>sunshine—all</nobr> are showing forth the praise of God who reigneth in the
          <nobr>heavens?—Manuscript</nobr> 9, June 20, 1884„ “Visit to Multnomah Falls.”</p>
