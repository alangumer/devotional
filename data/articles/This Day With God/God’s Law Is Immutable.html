    <h1>God’s Law Is Immutable</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. Psalm
          89:14.</strong></p>
      <p>It is no wonder that transgressors of God’s law at the present time will get as far from it as possible; for it
          condemns them. But those who hold that the ten commandments were abolished at the cruciﬁxion of Christ are in
          a similar deception to that of the Jews. The position that the law of God is rigorous and unbearable casts
          contempt upon Him who governs the universe in accordance with its holy precepts. A veil is over the hearts of
          those who hold this view in reading both the Old and the New Testament. The penalty for the least
          transgression of that law is death, and but for Christ, the sinner’s Advocate, it would be summarily visited
          on every offender. Justice and mercy are blended. Christ and the law stand side by side. The law convicts the
          transgressor, and Christ pleads in the sinner’s behalf.</p>
      <p>With the ﬁrst advent of Christ there was ushered in an era of greater light and glory; but it would indeed be
          sinful ingratitude to despise and ridicule the lesser light because a fuller and more glorious light had
          dawned. Those who despise the blessings and glory of the Jewish age are not prepared to be beneﬁted by the
          preaching of the gospel. The brightness of the Father’s glory, and the excellence and perfection of His sacred
          law, are only understood through the atonement made upon Calvary by His dear Son; but even the atonement loses
          its signiﬁcance when the law of God is rejected.</p>
      <p>The life of Christ was a most perfect and thorough vindication of His Father’s law, and His death attested its
          immutability. Christ did not, by bearing the sinner’s guilt, release man from his obligation to obey the law;
          for if the law could have been changed or abolished, He need not have come to this world to suffer and die.
          The very fact that Christ died for its transgressions attests the unchanging character of the Father’s
          law.</p>
      <p>The Jews had departed from God, and in their teaching had substituted their own traditions for the divine law.
          The life and teachings of Christ made plain and distinct the principles of this violated law. The heavenly
          host understood that the object of His mission was to exalt the Father’s law and make it honorable, and to
          justify its <nobr>claims.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 25, 1887.</p>
