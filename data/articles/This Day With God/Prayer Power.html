    <h1>Prayer Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to
          <nobr>us-ward,</nobr> not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter
          3:9.</strong></p>
      <p>It is a marvel to me that God will bear with the perversity of the children of men so long, bearing with their
          disobedience and yet suffering them to live, abusing His mercies, bearing false witness against Him in most
          wicked statements. But God’s ways are not as our ways, and we will not marvel at His loving forbearance and
          tender pity and inﬁnite compassion, for He has given an unmistakable evidence that this is just like His
          <nobr>character—slow</nobr> to anger, showing mercy unto thousands of those who love Him and keep His
          commandments.</p>
      <p>I am thankful indeed for the sweet peace I enjoy this morning. I rested well last night and feel to rest my
          soul upon God this morning. He will not leave me nor forsake me. He will be to me a very present help in time
          of need....</p>
      <p>Souls are perishing in their sins on every side. My soul is drawn out after them. I long to arouse them from
          their stupor of death. Oh, how many have never yet been warned, never heard the truth; while expostulations
          and warnings and prayers fall upon the ears of others who pay no heed, but reject privileges and opportunities
          which would be for their salvation if they would proﬁt by them. They seem <nobr>ice-bound.</nobr> But our own
          hearts must be warmed with the divine ﬁre; our own Christian efforts and our Christian example must be earnest
          and powerful.</p>
      <p>The obligations resting upon us are not small. Our sense of dependence will drive us closer to God, and our
          sense of duty to be performed will summon us to effort, combined with our earnest <nobr>prayers—works,</nobr>
          faith, and continual prayer. Power! Power! Our great cry is for power without measure! It awaits us. We have
          only to draw; to take God at His word; to act faith; to stand ﬁrmly upon the promises; to wrestle for the
          endowment of the grace of God. Learning is not essential; genius is not necessary; eloquence may be lacking;
          but the prayer of the lowly and contrite heart God hears, and when He hears no obstacles on earth can hinder.
          The power of God will make us <nobr>effectual.—Letter</nobr> 35, June 27, 1878„ to the president of the
          General Conference, her husband.</p>
