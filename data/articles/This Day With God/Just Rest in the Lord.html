    <h1>Just Rest in the Lord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
          bread. Psalm 37:25.</strong></p>
      <p>I am much grieved because you are sick and suffering. But cling to Him whom you have loved and served these
          many years. He gave His own life for the world, and He loves every one who trusts in Him. He sympathizes with
          those who suffer under the depression of disease. He feels every pang of anguish that His loved ones feel.
          Just rest in His arms, and know that He is your Saviour, and your very best Friend, and that He will never
          leave nor forsake you. He has been your dependence for many years, and your soul may rest in hope.</p>
      <p>You will come forth with other faithful ones who have believed in Him, to praise Him with a voice of triumph.
          All you are expected to do is to rest in His love. Do not worry. Jesus loves you, and now when you are weak
          and suffering, He holds you in His arms, just as a loving father holds a little child. Trust in Him in whom
          you have believed. Has He not loved and cared for you all through your lifetime? Just rest in the precious
          promises given you.</p>
      <p>The great plan of mercy from the beginning of time is to have every afﬂicted soul trust in His love. Your
          safety at the present time, when your mind is tortured with doubt, is not to trust in feeling, but in the
          living God. All He asks of you is to put your trust in Him, acknowledging Him as your faithful Saviour, who
          loves you, and has forgiven you all your mistakes and errors....</p>
      <p>I am instructed to say to you, He has pardoned all your sins, and put upon you the white robe of His
          righteousness. All He requires of you now is to rest in His love. He has you in His keeping. You have fought
          the battles of the Lord Jesus Christ, you have kept the faith, and henceforth there is laid up for you a crown
          of life, to be your reward in that day when life and immortality shall be given to all who have kept the faith
          and have not denied the Saviour’s name.</p>
      <p>That your mind is clouded is no evidence that Christ is not your precious Saviour. Now that the childhood of
          age has come upon you, He regards you as no less His child.... Rest in Christ’s love, my sister.... Trust the
          One who has</p>
      <p>helped you in the past to hold fast to the <nobr>faith.—Letter</nobr> 299, October 31, 1904„ to “My Dear Aged
          Sister” (Hare).</p>
