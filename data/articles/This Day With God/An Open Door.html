      <p><strong>But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. Job
          23:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Frequently the very best evidence that we can have that we are in the right way is that the least advance costs
          us effort and that darkness shrouds our pathway. It has been my experience that the loftiest heights of faith
          we can only reach through darkness and clouds....</p>
      <p>It is not safe for us to cherish doubts and fears, for these grow by looking upon and talking them. I feel to
          reach up my hand and grasp the hand of Christ as did the sinking disciple on the stormy sea. I want to do my
          work with ﬁdelity that when I shall stand before the great white throne and am called to answer for the things
          done in the body, which are all written in the book, that I may see souls standing there to testify I warned
          them, I entreated them to behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world.</p>
      <p>Oh, will there be souls then, saved through my instrumentality? Through Christ, I would set before the people
          an open door. “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it” (Revelation 3:8).</p>
      <p>The city of God with all its attractions is saying, “Come.” If we can by a holy life, by entreaties, by
          prayers, by warnings, point the sinner to the way of escape and fasten their attention to the heavenly gates
          open to receive them; if by faith they can see that the entrance into life is an open door, everything is
          gained. The earthly attractions will fade away, the heavenly will win and charm the soul....</p>
      <p>The hindrances that hold us back from perfecting Christian characters are in ourselves. Jesus can remove them.
          The cross He requires us to bear will create strength in us more than it consumes, and remove our heaviest
          burdens to take the burden of Christ, which is light. Conﬂicts and trials we must meet in the discharge of
          duty. Christ has called us to glory and to virtue. The life He has through His own suffering and death
          prepared for us to lead, would never have cost us a pain or grief if we had never left it. Every
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and every sacriﬁce we make in following Christ are so many steps of the lost sheep
          returning to the <nobr>fold.—Letter</nobr> 7, July 22, 1877„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
