    <h1>Cure for Covetousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye
          have heard. Colossians 1:23.</strong></p>
      <p>Only the inﬂuence of the grace of God will lead men to take their stand on the <nobr>self-denying</nobr>
          liberal side. The cause of God must not in any case be hindered. The message “Repent and be converted,” must
          go to all parts of the world. God has freely bestowed upon us His treasures of sunshine and shower, to cause
          vegetation to ﬂourish, and He expects every believer to show willing liberality in advancing the cause of
          truth. We need now to work as we have never worked before, that the gospel, which is the power of God unto
          salvation, may be proclaimed throughout the world. And those who are converted to the truth are to be the
          means, through their <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> of keeping the treasury supplied, that there may be meat in
          the Lord’s house.</p>
      <p>The Spirit of the Lord, cherished, is a sure remedy for the disease of covetousness. Talk it, live it. Put on
          the whole of the gospel armor. We need more of the spirit of prayer and more faith. The ﬁrst chapter of
          Colossians holds up before us our high responsibility.</p>
      <p>Paul says, “As ye also learned of Epaphras, ...who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.... We also,
          since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for</p>
      <p>you, and to desire that ye might be ﬁlled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
          understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and
          increasing in the knowledge of God” (Colossians <nobr>1:7-10).</nobr></p>
      <p>We must rise to a higher and still higher spirituality. We must cease all complaining, and cultivate the giving
          of thanks. We must work for the salvation of perishing souls.</p>
      <p>We must lay hold of the supreme Power, and close our ears to complaint and faultﬁnding. Crush this inclination,
          and empty the soul temple of <nobr>evil-thinking.</nobr> Let not one unhappy thought remain within. Souls are
          perishing in their sins. Work to the glory of <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 372, December 4, 1906„ to Elder O. A.
          Olsen and Dr. D. H. Kress, working in Australia.</p>
