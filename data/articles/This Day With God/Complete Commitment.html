    <h1>Complete Commitment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine
          heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. Deuteronomy 6:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>Angels were expelled from heaven because they would not work in harmony with God. They fell from their high
          estate because they wanted to be exalted. They had come to exalt themselves, and they forgot that their beauty
          of person and of character came from the Lord Jesus. This fact the [fallen] angels would obscure, that Christ
          was the only begotten Son of God, and they came to consider that they were not to consult Christ.</p>
      <p>One angel began the controversy and carried it on until there was rebellion in the heavenly courts, among the
          angels. They were lifted up because of their beauty.</p>
      <p>All should learn their lesson from this, that they are individually amenable to God. When they love God with
          all their hearts, they will be wise unto salvation. They will do His will, and their light will ever be their
          glory, and be undiminished because they recognize and fear and serve their Lord. The solemn work rests upon
          every soul to consider that he is a servant of Jesus Christ, solemnly pledged by his baptismal vows to clothe
          himself with the righteousness of Christ. Will we carry out the living example of the Lord Jesus?</p>
      <p>I am instructed that every believer must watch unto prayer, lest he fail in the Christian life battle. Every
          soul must daily seek the Lord with full purpose of heart, morning, noon, and night, and let the mind dwell
          upon the Word of God, to understand His requirements.</p>
      <p>The one <nobr>all-important</nobr> matter is to serve the Lord with full purpose of heart, and seek to become
          the Lord’s, heart and mind. All who come to the Saviour for counsel will receive the very help they need, if
          they will come in humility, and with assurance cling to that promise, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek,
          and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (Matthew 7:7)....</p>
      <p>Lift up the standard, beginning with full surrender and continuing in the simplicity of obedience to all the
          Lord’s commandments, according to His special directions. None of the important things speciﬁed in His Word
          are to be <nobr>neglected.—Letter</nobr> 42, April 29, 1910„ to Elder D. A. Parsons, a minister in southern
          California.</p>
