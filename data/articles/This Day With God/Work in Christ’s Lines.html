    <h1>Work in Christ’s Lines</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Pure religion and undeﬁled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
          their afﬂiction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. James 1:27.</strong></p>
      <p>Our work is incomplete if we do not educate others to be laborers together with God, visiting and praying with
          families, showing to the world what Jesus has done for us. God’s Word declares, “Pure religion and undeﬁled
          before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their afﬂiction, and to keep himself
          unspotted from the world” (James 1:27). These words are spoken to every follower of Christ. Not only the
          minister, but every soul connected with Him, is to be a worker in His vineyard. “Herein is my Father
          gloriﬁed,” Christ said, “that ye bear much fruit” (John 15:8). By His own life Christ has paid for your
          earnest, hearty cooperation. If you do not work as faithful missionaries, you are untrue to your trust, and
          you disappoint your Saviour....</p>
      <p>In His Word God has shown us the only way in which this work should be done. We are to do earnest, faithful
          work, laboring for souls as they that must give an account. “Repent, repent,” was the message rung out by John
          in the wilderness....</p>
      <p>Christ’s message to the people was, “Unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.” And the apostles were
          commanded to preach everywhere that men should repent. The Lord would have His servants preach today the old
          gospel doctrine, sorrow for sin, repentance, and confession. We want <nobr>old-fashioned</nobr> sermons,
          <nobr>old-fashioned</nobr> customs, <nobr>old-fashioned</nobr> fathers and mothers in Israel, who have the
          tenderness of Christ.</p>
      <p>The sinner must be labored for perseveringly, earnestly, wisely, until he shall see that he is a transgressor
          of God’s law, and shall exercise repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. When the sinner
          is conscious of his helpless condition, and feels his need of a Saviour, he may come with faith and hope to
          “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” Christ will accept the soul who comes to Him in
          true repentance. A broken and a contrite heart He will not despise.</p>
      <p>The battle cry is sounding along the line. Let every soldier of the cross push to the front, not in
          <nobr>self-sufﬁciency,</nobr> but in meekness and lowliness of <nobr>heart.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times,
          December 27, 1899.</p>
