      <p><strong>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 1 Timothy 3:9.</strong></p>
      <p>I praise the Lord this morning for the peace I enjoy. There is perfect rest for me in the Lord. I trust in His
          love. Why should we not rest in the love of God, the assurance of His word? What saith Jesus? “Come unto me,
          all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” What can be more positive than this
          promise? “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto
          your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr> Then come; let us
          who believe in Jesus Christ not delay a moment, but come.</p>
      <p>All who hold fast to themselves, as if fearful that after all the Lord Jesus does not mean as He says, show
          great dishonor to God. In keeping away from Jesus do not our actions say, “I do not believe the Lord Jesus
          means it”? You do not treat your human friends in this doubting, distrustful manner. If they show you respect,
          if they make you a promise, you do not say, “I have no faith; I cannot believe any of your promises. This is
          very trying to me, nevertheless I cannot believe your word.”</p>
      <p>You virtually tell God all of this in your actions.... You have found the rest</p>
      <p>always when you have come, but you begin to question, to look at yourself, to groan over yourself. Now stop all
          this. Take off that yoke you have manufactured for your neck, which galls so terribly, and take Christ’s yoke,
          which he declares is easy, and His burden, which He tells you is light....</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is the Comforter, your Comforter. Has the Holy Spirit failed to fulﬁll His part of the work? If
          so, you are not to blame. But the promise is sure and steadfast. When you say you have not faith in God you
          make God a liar and show that you have no conﬁdence in the Holy Spirit’s work, which is always ready to help
          our inﬁrmities. He is always waiting at your door, always knocking for admittance. Let Him in. All you have to
          do is to put your will over on the Lord’s side. You need the promise, but it is the inﬁnite One behind the
          promise in whom you are to have perfect conﬁdence. Say it: “I am the Lord’s. I do believe.” Crowd out every
          doubt from the soul. Have faith in God. He loves you. Never, never allow yourself to doubt or distrust
          <nobr>Him.—Manuscript</nobr> 80, May 29, 1893„ diary.</p>
