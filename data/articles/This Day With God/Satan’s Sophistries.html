    <h1>Satan’s Sophistries</h1>

      <p><strong>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:
          neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. 1 Corinthians 2:14.</strong></p>
      <p>All that leading scientiﬁc minds may conjecture aside from Christ, the Light of the world, is as chaff compared
          to the wheat. Christ is grieved that so few understand the science of oneness with Himself. Minds that are not
          under the divine guidance cannot understand the science of redemption. The mystery of godliness is found only
          in the believing soul who is divested of self. He is greatest in the kingdom of heaven who will become
          teachable as a little child.</p>
      <p>The knowledge and education of Nicodemus was considered great and deep, but Christ showed him that they were of
          no value with God. He must be born again. He must receive new ideas, and understand that God is in all true
          science. The Lord not only expects man to do his best, but to be learning and educating others. Then he can
          say, “I know in whom I believe. Jesus is the Bread of Life. If I feed upon Him, I shall be one with Christ in
          God.”</p>
      <p>In our connection with any line of God’s work, we must use the sacred ﬁre. Supposed human ability and efﬁciency
          is common ﬁre, but this is unacknowledged by God. A decided position must be maintained upon the high platform
          of eternal truth. The time has come when all who work in Christ’s lines will have the mark of God, in words,
          in spirit, in character, in their honor of Immanuel. While so many of our people have been hovering about the
          mystery of faith and godliness, they could have solved the matter by proclaiming, “I know that Christ is my
          portion forever. His mercy, His gentleness hath made me great.” ...</p>
      <p>The truth of God has not been magniﬁed in His believing people, because they have not brought it into their
          personal experience. They conform to the world, and depend upon it for their inﬂuence. They allow the world to
          convert them, and introduce the common ﬁre to take the place of the sacred, that they may, in their line of
          work, meet the world’s standard. There must not be these efforts made to ape the world’s customs. This is
          common, not sacred ﬁre. The living Bread must not only be admired, but eaten. That Bread which cometh down
          from heaven will give life to the <nobr>soul.—Manuscript</nobr> 96, August 10, 1898„ “Christ, Our
          Portion.”</p>
