    <h1>Love Fulﬁlls the Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulﬁlling of the law. Romans
          13:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The attribute that Christ appreciates most in man is charity (love) out of a pure heart. This is the fruit
          borne upon the Christian tree. “Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God” (1 John 4:7). The Lord
          Jesus has said, “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye
          also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another”
          (John 13:34, 35).</p>
      <p>When enshrouded in the cloudy pillar He spake to the children of Israel through Moses: “Thou shalt not hate thy
          brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him. Thou shalt
          not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
          thyself: I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:17, 18). “These things I command you, that ye love one another” (John
          15:17).</p>
      <p>If you are Bible Christians, each will have as great an interest for his brother workman as for himself. The
          work of giving the bread of life to souls that are ready to perish, should be all absorbing, keeping the
          hearts of the workers kind and tender to one another. True Christian courtesy needs to be cultivated, the mind
          and heart must be educated and trained by deeds of kindness to have an unselﬁsh interest in every laborer in
          the work.</p>
      <p>Regard yourselves as missionaries, not among heathen, but among your own brethren. It requires a vast amount of
          time and labor to convince one soul in regard to the truth. How much money has been expended in efforts to
          turn men and women from sin to righteousness! And when souls are brought into the truth, what takes place in
          heaven? There is more joy in the presence of the angels over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and
          nine just persons who [think they] need no repentance (see Luke 15:7)....</p>
      <p>If you keep yourselves in the love of God, an inﬂuence will surround the soul which will be a savor of life
          unto life. You are to watch for souls as they that must give an <nobr>account.—Manuscript</nobr> 16, December
          22, 1892„ “Love for Brethren.”</p>
