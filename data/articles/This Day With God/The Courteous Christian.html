    <h1>The Courteous Christian</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath
          forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.</strong></p>
      <p>We need to cherish love in our hearts. We should not be ready to think evil of our brethren. We must put the
          least construction on what they do or what they say. We must be Bible Christians. “Seeing ye have puriﬁed your
          souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
          another with a pure heart fervently” (1 Peter 1:22).</p>
      <p>We must not be heedless in regard to our own souls’ salvation. “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith;
          prove your own selves” (2 Corinthians 13:5).</p>
      <p>We are not to pass on indifferently. We must inquire into the character of our thoughts and feelings, our
          tempers, purposes, words, and deeds. We are not safe unless we are constantly and successfully warring against
          our own sinful corruptions. We must consider whether we are an example of Christian holiness, whether we are
          in the faith. Unless we search diligently examining our hearts in the light of God’s Word,
          <nobr>self-love</nobr> will prompt to a much better opinion of ourselves than we should have. We must not be
          so earnest in our efforts to set others right that we shall neglect our own souls. We need not be so zealous
          for our brethren and in this zeal neglect the work that needs to be done for ourselves. Another’s wrong will
          not make our cases any nearer right. There is an individual work to be done for ourselves, which we should in
          no wise neglect....</p>
      <p>If we are ﬁlled with mercy and love of God, a corresponding effect will be produced upon others. We have
          nothing of which to boast. All is the gift of a beneﬁcent Saviour. We must attend to our own souls diligently.
          We must walk in humility. We want no war garments on, but the garments of peace and righteousness. May the
          Lord teach us how to wear His yoke and how to bear His burdens. Everything in this cause and in this work may
          be accomplished with a kind, conciliating spirit. We may be courteous, always, and never be afraid of being
          too much so. We must practice showing good will toward all <nobr>men.—Letter</nobr> 11, March 15, 1880„ to a
          General Conference ofﬁcer.</p>
