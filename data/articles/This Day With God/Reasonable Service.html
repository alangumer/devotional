    <h1>Reasonable Service</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from
          above is ﬁrst pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
          partiality, and without hypocrisy. James 3:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>There is one thing upon which I am settled. It is not the duty of the Lord’s children to remain in an
          objectionable climate, and be continually failing in health. Many of our brethren have done this and have lost
          their lives. When in a place where the atmosphere is ﬁlled with friction, when the work of a laborer is made
          exceeding hard by those who are continually counterworking his efforts and scheming to obtain advantage, then
          let the laborer go to some place where the atmosphere is more healthful spiritually, and where he can have
          more hope of success....</p>
      <p>We must remember that in every place in which we work on the Lord’s side, we counterwork the efforts of Satanic
          agencies. You have passed through trials; and you will have trials to meet to a greater or less degree,
          wherever you may be. Satan will watch every weak point of character, and will strive for the mastery; but we
          cannot afford to lose our chance of gaining a victory for the Lord’s side. Constantly we encounter foes, and
          unless we are on guard, we shall lose precious opportunities of obtaining victories....</p>
      <p>The troubles of this present time are diversiﬁed in form, but Christ has passed over the ground, and we need
          not be in uncertainty. He has invited us, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
          give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest
          unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr> The promise is,
          “I will be with him in trouble” (Psalm 91:15).</p>
      <p>O what a fortress and high tower He is for us. I have been passing through great sorrow because some among
          those who ...have evidence that the Lord has used the feeble agent to express great and everlasting truths,
          are turning from the living wells to hew out and drink at broken fountains. My soul is in agony night after
          night. I can sleep but a few hours; for the thought of those who are in false paths afﬂicts my
          <nobr>soul.—Letter</nobr> 80, February 15, 1906„ to F. M. Wilcox, manager of the Boulder, Colorado, Sanitarium
          and later editor of the Review and Herald.</p>
