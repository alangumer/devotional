    <h1>Press Toward the Mark</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Philippians
          3:14.</strong></p>
      <p>We all have an experience to gain and crosses to lift. If we study our own pleasure and gratify our own desires
          and taste, we shall be found wanting in the day of retribution and rewards. If we live to do others good and
          to glorify God, we shall not be considerate of ourselves, but shall seek to be of use in the world, blessing
          humanity, and we shall receive the blessing of “Well done” from the lips of the Master.</p>
      <p>We should live for the next world. It is so wretched to live a haphazard, aimless life. We want an object in
          <nobr>life—to</nobr> live for a purpose. God help us all to be <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing,</nobr> less
          <nobr>self-caring,</nobr> more forgetful of self and selﬁsh interest; and to do good, not for the honor we
          expect to receive here, but because this is the object of our life and will answer the end of our existence.
          Let our daily prayer go up to God that He will divest us of selﬁshness....</p>
      <p>I have seen that those who live for a purpose, seeking to beneﬁt and bless their fellow men and to honor and
          glorify their Redeemer, are the truly happy ones on the earth, while the man who is restless, discontented,
          and seeking this and testing that, hoping to ﬁnd happiness, is always complaining of disappointment. He is
          always in want, never satisﬁed, because he lives for himself alone. Let it be your aim to do good, to act your
          part in life faithfully.</p>
      <p>There is hurry and excitement. Men feverishly invest their capital of money in bonds and stocks, become wealthy
          in a day, and yet are unsatisﬁed. They continue to invest with insane expectancy. The bank stock goes down,
          the millionaire in the morning is a beggar at night and the way they think best to end the matter is with
          pistol, rope, or the waters of the bay. Money is a blessing when those who use it consider that they are the
          Lord’s stewards, that they are handling the Lord’s capital, and must one day give account of their
          stewardship. It is the love of money which the Bible condemns as the root of all <nobr>evil—such</nobr> love
          that when a man loses money the precious life God has given him is made of no account because money is
          <nobr>gone.—Letter</nobr> 17, September 28, 1872„ to J. E. White.</p>
