      <p><strong>And he said unto me, My grace is sufﬁcient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most
          gladly therefore will I rather glory in my inﬁrmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2
          Corinthians 12:9.</strong></p>
      <p>During the past night I have slept but little. I tried to look to Jesus, to place myself in the hands of the
          Great Physician. He has said, “My grace is sufﬁcient for thee” (2 Corinthians 12:9). The grace of Christ leads
          men to speak right words under all circumstances. Bodily suffering is no excuse for <nobr>un-Christlike</nobr>
          actions.</p>
      <p>During these sleepless hours, the subject of overcoming has been the burden of my thoughts. “To him that
          overcometh,” the Lord declares, “will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set
          down with my Father in his throne” (Revelation 3:21).</p>
      <p>There are those who are forever making excuses for walking in the counsels of the enemy. Some think that
          because they have physical inﬁrmities, they are privileged to speak pettish words and to act in an unlovely
          manner. But has Jesus made no provision for such ones to overcome temptation? Because of trial and afﬂiction,
          are they to be unthankful and unholy? Are not the rays of Christ’s righteousness bright enough to dispel the
          shadow of Satan?</p>
      <p>The grace of God is declared to be sufﬁcient for all the ills and trials against which human beings have to
          contend. Is it powerless then against bodily inﬁrmity? Shall divine grace stand back, while Satan takes the
          ﬁeld, holding the victim in the power of his evil attributes?</p>
      <p>O how precious is Jesus to the soul who trusts in Him. But many are walking in darkness because they bury their
          faith in the shadow of Satan. They have not done that which it was in their power to do through the grace of
          Jesus. They have not talked faith and hope and courage. Never for a moment should we allow Satan to think that
          his power to distress and annoy is greater than the power of Christ to uphold and strengthen.</p>
      <p>“Men ought always to pray, and not to faint” (Luke 18:1). Every sincere prayer that is offered to God is
          mingled with the efﬁcacy of Christ’s blood. If the answer is deferred, it is because God desires us to show a
          holy boldness in claiming the pledged word of God. He is faithful who hath <nobr>promised.—Manuscript</nobr>
