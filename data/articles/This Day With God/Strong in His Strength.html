    <h1>Strong in His Strength</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Romans
          6:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Be constantly learning of Jesus, constantly increasing in faith and growing in grace and the knowledge of the
          truth. We are doing a great work, and the Lord is our Helper, the Lord is our Shield. He will not leave nor
          forsake us. Angels of God are engaged in this work of proclaiming the message of warning for the world. Of
          ourselves we can do nothing. We are as weak as water without the Spirit of the Lord. Our strength is in hiding
          in Jesus. Let Christ appear as the One altogether lovely, and the chief among ten thousand.</p>
      <p>Again, I exhort you to take good care of the habitation which God has given you. Let not sin reign in your
          mortal body, and do not waste the physical powers God has given you, but cherish your strength, putting your
          whole trust in a perfect Saviour. He wants you to be victorious and wear a jeweled crown at last.</p>
      <p>Heaven, sweet heaven, is the saint’s eternal home. We shall rest by and by. Let us then so use our powers as
          not abusing them, that God may increase and sanctify them and make them of the highest service. May the Lord
          come very near you, ...and give you a strong inﬂuence to beat down error and superstition and the works of
          Satan.</p>
      <p>We may ask of God great things and He will give them us. We shall be strong in His strength. You will receive
          opposition from the clergy as you live up to, and present to others, the high standard of the religion of the
          Bible; contempt and jeering, slander and falsehood will follow you. Your motives, your words, your actions
          will be misunderstood and misrepresented and condemned. But, if you pursue the work irrespective of the abuse
          given you, if you do right, if you are kind and patient, humble in spirit, happy in God, you will have
          inﬂuence. You will receive the sympathy of all those who are honest and reasonable.</p>
      <p>Hold forth the Word of life, the tempest of opposition will spend itself by its own fury and will subside. The
          clamor will die away.... The harmony</p>
      <p>of truth will be seen and will be felt and will be obeyed by the honest and <nobr>God-fearing.—Letter</nobr>
          16, February 21, 1879„ to Elder J. G. Matteson, pioneer minister in Denmark.</p>
