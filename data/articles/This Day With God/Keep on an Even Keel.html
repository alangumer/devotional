      <p><strong>For I have given you an example. John 13:15.</strong></p>
      <p>We are forming characters for heaven. No character can be complete without trial and suffering. We must be
          tested, we must be tried. Christ bore the test of character of our behalf that we might bear this test in our
          own behalf through the divine strength He has brought to us. Christ is our example in patience, in
          forbearance, in meekness and lowliness of mind. He was at variance and at war with the whole ungodly world,
          yet He did not give way to passion and violence manifested in words and actions, although receiving shameful
          abuse in return for good works. He was afﬂicted, He was rejected and despitefully treated, yet He retaliated
          not. He possessed <nobr>self-control,</nobr> dignity, and majesty. He suffered with calmness and for abuse
          gave only compassion, pity, and love....</p>
      <p>Imitate your Redeemer in these things. Do not get excited when things go wrong. Do not let self arise, and lose
          your <nobr>self-control</nobr> because you fancy things are not as they should be. Because others are wrong is
          no excuse for you to do wrong. Two wrongs will not make one right. You have victories to gain in order to
          overcome as Christ overcame.</p>
      <p>Christ never murmured, never uttered discontent, displeasure, or resentment. He was never disheartened,
          discouraged, rufﬂed, or fretted. He was patient, calm, and <nobr>self-possessed</nobr> under the most exciting
          and trying circumstances. All His works were performed with a quiet dignity and ease, whatever commotion was
          around Him. Applause did not elate Him. He feared not the threats of His enemies. He moved amid the world of
          excitement, of violence and crime, as the sun moves above the clouds. Human passions and commotions and trials
          were beneath Him. He sailed like the sun above them all. Yet He was not indifferent to the woes of men. His
          heart was ever touched with the sufferings and necessities of His brethren, as though He Himself was the one
          afﬂicted. He had a calm inward joy, a peace which was serene. His will was ever swallowed up in the will of
          His Father. Not My will but Thine be done, was heard from His pale and quivering <nobr>lips.—Letter</nobr>
          51a, September 11, 1874„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
