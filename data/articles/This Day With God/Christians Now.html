      <p><strong>And now, little children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have conﬁdence, and not be
          ashamed before him at his coming. 1 John 2:28.</strong></p>
      <p>Many mean to be Christians sometime, but do not want to make the start just yet.... Not only are you losing
          much yourselves in giving to the enemy the very</p>
      <p>best part of your lives, but you are bringing your children up in the neglect of eternal things. They have your
          example, all on the wrong side. Your neglect is robbing them of the very knowledge which God makes it your
          duty to give them that they may learn to love, reverence, and obey the requirements of God....</p>
      <p>Your little ones are quick and observing in the presence of older persons. You are molding their minds to think
          as you think, to act as you act; not to bow the knee to the Sovereign of the universe because you do not do
          so. It is bad enough and fearful enough to contemplate the loss of your own souls unless you surrender to God,
          to contemplate that you are not entering in at the door of salvation yourselves, but it is more terrible to
          think that you bar the way to the entrance of your children.... Forget for once all about your dignity and
          social</p>
      <p>position, and start out before your children as learners in the school of Christ. Tell them frankly that you
          have made a mistake in neglecting to acknowledge yourself as a child of God. Tell them that you want that as a
          family you should now commence to live for God, and them read and pray with your children....</p>
      <p>You can have rest and peace only as you ﬁnd it in Jesus. The world, its maxims and its customs, are the parents
          of unnumbered sufferings. Many suffer with ungratiﬁed wishes. They bind burdens on
          <nobr>themselves—their</nobr> ungratiﬁed desires. With the condemnation of <nobr>conscience—not</nobr> having
          harmony with God, and with an apprehension of His displeasure and <nobr>wrath—their</nobr> existence is a
          matter of continual anxiety. There is a dearth of heavenly consolation in suffering. They are fearful of
          punishment. There is a fearful foreboding of the future....</p>
      <p>A ransom has been given for souls, a sacriﬁce that was <nobr>inﬁnite—a</nobr> Monarch dying for rebellious
          subjects, that they may escape from sin, corruption, and misery. They may all receive pardon, purity, and
          heaven through the great condescension of the Son of God....</p>
      <p>Come while Mercy’s sweet voice invites <nobr>you.—Letter</nobr> 26, September 12, 1879„ a personal testimony to
          a husband and wife.</p>
