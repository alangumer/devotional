      <p><strong>For we wrestle not against ﬂesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
          rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians
          6:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Since coming to this meeting [biennial session, Paciﬁc Union Conference], I have passed through a strange
          experience. One day, after appearing before the conference to read some matter to you, the burden that was
          upon my soul continued to press upon me after I returned to my room. I was in distress of mind. That night I
          could not seem to lose myself in sleep. It seemed as if evil angels were right in the room where I was. And
          while I was suffering in mind, it seemed as if I was suffering great bodily pain. My right arm, which through
          the years has nearly always been preserved from disease and suffering, seemed powerless. I could not lift it.
          Then I had a most severe, excruciating pain in the ear; then most terrible suffering in the jaw. It seemed as
          if I must scream. But I kept saying, “Lord, You know all about it.”</p>
      <p>I was in perfect agony. It seemed that my brain and every part of my body was suffering. At times I would rise
          up, and think, “I will not lie here another moment.” Then I would think, “You will only arouse those who are
          in the house, and they cannot do anything for you.” And so I kept looking to the Lord, and saying, “Lord, You
          know all about this pain.” The suffering continued, at times in the jaw, then in the brain, and then in other
          members of the body, until nearly daylight. Just before the break of day I fell asleep for about an hour.</p>
      <p>My arm is all right this morning. Legions of evil angels were in that room, and if I had not clung by faith to
          the Lord, I do not know what might have become of me....</p>
      <p>I shall never be able to give you a description of the satanic forces that were at work in that room, ...but
          since standing before you the next morning, I have had no suffering.</p>
      <p>Light has been coming to me that unless we have more evident movings of the Spirit of God, and greater
          manifestations of divine power working in our midst, many of God’s people will be overcome. Satanic agencies
          will come in, as they came to me. But we cannot afford to yield to the power of the
          <nobr>enemy.—Manuscript</nobr> 25, January 28, 1910„ “An Address to the Workers Assembled at the Paciﬁc Union
          Conference.”</p>
