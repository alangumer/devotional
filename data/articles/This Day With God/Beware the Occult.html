    <h1>Beware the Occult</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that
          peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? Isaiah
          8:19.</strong></p>
      <p>Spiritualism is the masterpiece of deception. It is Satan’s most successful and fascinating
          <nobr>delusion—one</nobr> calculated to take hold of the sympathies of those who have laid their loved ones in
          the grave. Evil angels come in the form of those loved ones, and relate incidents connected with their lives,
          and perform acts which they performed while living. In this way they lead persons to believe that their dead
          friends are angels, hovering over them, and communicating with them. These evil angels, who assume to be the
          deceased friends, are regarded with a certain idolatry, and with many their word has greater weight than the
          Word of God. Thus men and women are led to reject the truth, and give “heed to seducing spirits.”</p>
      <p>The Word of God declares in positive terms that “the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any
          thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their
          hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is
          done under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6). This plain scripture directly contradicts the teaching of
          Spiritualism, and if it were heeded would save souls from the snare of the enemy.</p>
      <p>Many are investigating Spiritualism simply from curiosity. They have no real faith in it, and would start back
          horriﬁed at the idea of becoming mediums; but they are venturing on forbidden and dangerous ground. When they
          are fast in the toils of the deceiver, they ﬁnd they are in the power of him who makes the most abject slaves
          of his servants, and nothing can deliver them but the power of God. The only safety for us is in trusting
          implicitly and following faithfully the instruction of the Word of God. The Bible is the only chart that marks
          out the narrow path which shuns the pitfalls of destruction....</p>
      <p>What love, what wonderful love, that God bears with the perversity of His people, and sends help to every soul
          that desires to do His will, and forsake sin! If man will but cooperate with the agencies of Heaven, he may
          come off more than conqueror. Fallen creatures as we are, capable of the most revolting crimes, yet we may
          become victors. The Signs of the Times, August 26, 1889.</p>
