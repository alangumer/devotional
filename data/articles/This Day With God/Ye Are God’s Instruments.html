      <p><strong>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
          on his name. John 1:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ came to the earth to present a true and exalted standard. Brief as was the period of His public
          ministry, He accomplished the work He came to do. How impressive were the truths He taught, how complete His
          lifework! What spiritual food He daily imparted as He presented the bread of life to thousands of hungry
          souls. His life was a living ministry of the Word. He was the Light of the world, pointing to men the Way, the
          Truth, and the Life. He was its food, the Bread of life. He promised nothing that He did not perform. “Ask,”
          He said, “and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (Matthew
          7:7).</p>
      <p>Just as we trace the pathway of a stream of living water by the line of living green it produces, so Christ
          could be seen in the deeds of mercy that marked His path at every step. Wherever He went health sprang up, and
          happiness followed wherever He had passed. The words of eternal life were presented in such simplicity that a
          child could understand them. Men, women, and children were so impressed with His manner of explaining the
          Scriptures that they would catch the very intonation of His voice, place the emphasis upon His words, and
          imitate His gestures. Youth caught His spirit of ministry, and sought to pattern after His gracious ways by
          seeking to assist those whom they saw needed help.</p>
      <p>The blind and deaf rejoiced in His presence. The face of Christ was the ﬁrst face that many eyes had ever
          looked upon; His words the ﬁrst that had ever fallen upon their ears. These, restored, followed Him wherever
          it was possible. His words to the ignorant opened to them a fountain of life. He dispensed His blessings
          abundantly and continuously; they were the garnered treasures of eternity, given in Christ, the Lord’s rich
          gifts to man.</p>
      <p>Christ’s work in behalf of mankind is not ﬁnished. It continues today. Through John He declares that as many as
          receive Him, to them will He give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His
          <nobr>name.—Manuscript</nobr> 79, October 1, 1906„ “Leave Your Nets and Follow Me.”</p>
