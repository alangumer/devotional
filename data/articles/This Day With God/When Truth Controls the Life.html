    <h1>When Truth Controls the Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. John
          8:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus took upon Him the form of sinful man, clothing His divinity with humanity. But He was holy, even
          as God is holy. If He had not been without spot or stain of sin, He could not have been the Saviour of
          mankind. He was a Sinbearer, needing no atonement. One with God in purity and holiness of character, He could
          make a propitiation for the sins of the whole world.</p>
      <p>Christ is the light of the world. Through Him light is shining amid the moral darkness. If He were not light,
          the darkness would not be apparent, because light reveals darkness. The clearer the light, the more manifest
          the contrast between light and darkness. Let the light be removed, and there is nought but darkness.</p>
      <p>Christ has declared our position. “He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
          life” (John 8:12). He is Himself the bright and morning Star. He is the Sun of Righteousness, the brightness
          of His Father’s glory. He is the “true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world” (chap.
          1:9). A Physician, a Healer, He came to restore the moral image of God that was lost by transgression.</p>
      <p>When Christ abides in the soul by faith, He makes the one who loves Him all light in the Lord. It is true that
          many who say they believe the truth have only a nominal faith. They are not doers of the Word. They profess to
          believe, but their profession will not convert them....</p>
      <p>When Christ dwells in the heart, His presence is apparent. Good and pleasant words and actions reveal the
          Spirit of Christ. Sweetness of temper is manifested. There is no angry passion, no obstinacy, no
          <nobr>evil-surmising.</nobr> There is no hatred in the heart, because ...ideas and methods ...are not accepted
          and appreciated by others....</p>
      <p>When the truth controls the life, there is purity and freedom from sin. The glory, the fullness, the
          completeness of the gospel plan is fulﬁlled in the life. The light of truth irradiates the soul temple. The
          understanding takes hold of <nobr>Christ.—Manuscript</nobr> 164, December 14, 1898„ “Be Ye Therefore Perfect,
          Even as Your Father Which Is in Heaven Is Perfect.”</p>
