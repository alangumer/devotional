    <h1>Meeting the Requirements</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time. Let your speech always be
          gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer every one. Colossians 4:5, 6,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Let not cares be so magniﬁed that the time shall be occupied in many cares that are not positively essential.
          The seriousness of this question presses upon my mind with an intensity that I cannot express. Time is
          passing, and when I am presented with the many churches that are not prepared to work for the Master, but are
          in a careless, unconcerned state, I am alarmed, and inquire, What can I say, what can I do, to change this
          order of things? I can say, “What shall it proﬁt a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
          soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Mark 8:36, 37).</p>
      <p>I think none of us are in a state to realize we must be laborers together with God. Many do not understand what
          true conversion means, what it involves. And now I address you and your family, that you may be aroused and
          impressed with the solemn duty to seek to arouse them to a sense of the need of most diligent watching and
          seeking to save perishing souls out of Christ. Every day warn someone who knows not that the end of all things
          is at hand.</p>
      <p>Not one jot or tittle of God’s holy requirements will ever be changed to meet man in his unready condition. His
          holy Word will never change or be done away. The world is asleep in their sins. Heaven and earth shall pass
          away, but His Word can never pass away. All of us must be guided by the Word of God. What a work is before us,
          and professed Christians realize it not! “Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not
          enter into the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 18:3)....</p>
      <p>How few realize the inﬂuence of the little things in this life. Those who can bear the test, the proving of
          God, will be acknowledged of Christ. The truth, saving truth, of God’s Word, lived, will ﬁt us for the company
          of the redeemed. God help us to appreciate moral excellence. Reﬁned mental qualities, sanctiﬁed, are of more
          value than the gold of Ophir. The formation of a true moral standing with God is the work of a lifetime. Teach
          this, my dear brother and sister, by precept and <nobr>example.—Letter</nobr> 37a, April 1, 1903„ to Brother
          and Sister Burden, at the Sydney, Australia, Sanitarium.</p>
