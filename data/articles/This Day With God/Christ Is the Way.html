    <h1>Christ Is the Way</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufﬁceth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been
          so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father. John
          14:8, 9.</strong></p>
      <p>We cannot by searching ﬁnd out God. But He has revealed Himself in the character of Christ, who is the
          brightness of the Father’s glory, and the express image of His person. If we desire a knowledge of God, we
          must be Christlike....</p>
      <p>He who does not seek each day to be more like Christ, cannot know the character of God. Living a pure life
          through faith in Christ as a personal Saviour brings the believer into a clearer, higher conception of God. No
          man whose character is not noble and Christlike can set forth God in a correct light. He may preach Christ,
          but he does not show his hearers that Christ is an abiding guest in his heart....</p>
      <p>Those who are partakers of Christ’s love through a reception of the truth will give evidence of this by making
          earnest, <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> efforts to give the message of God’s love to those who are in error.
          Thus they become laborers together with Christ. Love for God and for one another unites the soul to Christ by
          the golden links of love. The soul is bound up with Him in sanctiﬁed, elevated union.</p>
      <p>True sanctiﬁcation unites believers to Christ and to one another in the bonds of tender sympathy. This union
          causes to ﬂow continually into the heart rich currents of Christlike love, which ﬂows forth again in love for
          one another.</p>
      <p>The qualities which it is essential for all to possess are those which marked the completeness of Christ’s
          <nobr>character—His</nobr> love, His patience, His unselﬁshness, and His goodness....</p>
      <p>It is the greatest and most fatal deception to suppose that a man can have faith unto life eternal, without
          possessing Christlike love for his brethren. He who loves God and his neighbor is ﬁlled with light and love.
          God is in him and all around him. Christians love those around them as precious souls for whom Christ has
          died. There is no such thing as a loveless Christian, for “God is <nobr>love.”—Manuscript</nobr> 133,
          September 20, 1899„ “The Importance of the Law of God.”</p>
