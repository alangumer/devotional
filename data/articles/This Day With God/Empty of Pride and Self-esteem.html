      <p>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. Colossians 2:6.</p>
      <p>When our hearts are sanctiﬁed by the truth, they will be in unity with the heart of Christ. Says the apostle,
          “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5). Is
          <nobr>self-seeking,</nobr><nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> pressing its way into your soul? Contemplate Jesus your
          Saviour. Think how He humbled Himself. He was Commander in the heavenly courts, but He laid aside His crown,
          His kingly robe, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that humanity might touch humanity, and divinity lay
          hold upon divinity. For the sake of fallen man He humbled Himself.</p>
      <p>There are some ...who have been standing in their own light. Some have been ready to discover the evil, and
          talk of the evil, but the good they have seen in their brethren they have not commended. Those who are ready
          to speak and think evil of their brethren are hurting Christ in the person of His saints. They grieve the
          heart of Christ, and place their own souls in jeopardy ...</p>
      <p>Who of us have emptied ourselves of pride and <nobr>self-esteem?</nobr> Who of us are really in earnest as was
          Jacob, who wrestled with the angel with all the energy of his being? Jacob put forth all his strength,
          supposing that he was wrestling with a lawless opponent, but the Lord put His ﬁnger with a divine touch upon
          him, and the wrestling ceased. Jacob knew that it was the Lord. Then, all broken, he fell upon the neck of the
          Angel, and held Him, pleading, “Bless me, even me.” The Angel said, “Let me go, for the day breaketh.”</p>
      <p>It was now Jacob’s turn to make the terms, and he said, “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. And he
          said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
          Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. And Jacob asked him, and
          said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he
          blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my
          life is preserved” (Genesis <nobr>32:26-30).</nobr></p>
