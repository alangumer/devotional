    <h1>God’s Care for His Church</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine
          which ye have learned; and avoid them. Romans 16:17.</strong></p>
      <p>In all ages of the world there have been men who think they have a work to do for the Lord, and show no respect
          for those whom the Lord has been using. They do not make right applications of Scripture, they wrest the
          Scriptures to sustain their own ideas. Whatever may be the claims of those who draw away from the body to
          proclaim theories of their own invention, they are in Satan’s service, to get up some new device to divert
          souls from the truth for this time.</p>
      <p>Beware of those who arise with a great burden to denounce the church. The chosen ones who are standing and
          breasting the storm of opposition from the world, and are uplifting the downtrodden commandments of God to
          exalt them as holy and honorable, are indeed the light of the world. How dare mortal man pass his judgment
          upon them, and call the church a harlot, Babylon, a den of thieves, a cage of every unclean and hateful bird,
          the habitation of devils, making the nations drunk with the wine of her fornication, confederating with the
          kings and great men of the earth, waxing rich through the abundance of her delicacies, and proclaiming that
          her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities? Is this the message we have to bear
          to <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists? I tell you, no! God has given no man any such message. Let these men
          humble their hearts before God, and in true contrition repent that they have even for a time stood by the side
          of the accuser of the brethren who accused them before God day and night....</p>
      <p>Supposing this spurious message is the one everyone must hear for this time, “Come out of her, my people,”
          where shall we go? ...</p>
      <p>I tell you, my brethren, the Lord has an organized body through whom He will work. There may be more than a
          score of Judases among them; there may be a rash Peter who will under circumstances of trial deny his Lord;
          there may be persons represented by John, whom Jesus loved, but he may have a zeal that would destroy men’s
          lives by calling down ﬁre from heaven upon them to revenge an insult to Christ and to the truth. But the great
          Teacher seeks to give lessons of instruction to correct these existing <nobr>evils.—Manuscript</nobr> 21, June
          12, 1893,.</p>
