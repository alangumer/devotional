    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Luke
          14:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Let no one exalt himself, talking of himself, extolling his abilities, displaying his knowledge, and
          cultivating <nobr>self-conceit.</nobr> Let no one seek to tear down the work of others who do not labor
          according to his standard. The heavenly Teacher gives us the invitation, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and
          are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
          heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew
          <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr> Christ was never <nobr>self-conﬁdent,</nobr> bigoted, or <nobr>self-conceited.</nobr>
          He declared, “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he
          doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise” (John 5:19)....</p>
      <p>No man has a right to call himself his own. And no man possesses any good thing that he can call his own. Every
          man, every thing, is the property of the Lord. All that man receives from the bounty of heaven is still the
          Lord’s. Whatever we have that is of value, we should use for the beneﬁt of our fellowmen, in order that they
          shall become valuable workers. Every energy, every endowment, is a talent that should contribute to God’s
          glory by being used in His service. Our <nobr>God-given</nobr> capabilities should not be made to serve selﬁsh
          ends. We should always be willing to impart, letting others know all that we know; and we should rejoice, if
          they in their work develop an energy and an intelligence superior to that which we possess.</p>
      <p>God’s gifts are not to be used for the exaltation of self, but are to be put out to the exchangers, so that He
          shall receive His own with usury. Let not one attempt to secure greatness, happiness, or
          <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation</nobr> by diverting from their proper use the powers with which he is endowed; for by
          so doing he dishonors the Giver, and fails of fulﬁlling the purpose for which he was created. All our powers
          come from God, and should be used to His glory....</p>
      <p>No one has the least cause for boasting. No one has any reason to glorify or exalt self, even when one does his
          very <nobr>best.—Letter</nobr> 10, May 3, 1884„ to a pioneer minister in Denmark.</p>
