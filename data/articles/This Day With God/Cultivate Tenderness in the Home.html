      <p><strong>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of
          sins. 1 Peter 4:8.</strong></p>
      <p>The young man who came to Jesus asked what he should do that he might inherit eternal life. Jesus told him to
          keep the commandments, and enumerated several of the precepts of the law. The young man said, “All these
          things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?” (Matthew 19:20). The ﬁrst four commandments enjoin upon
          man the duty of loving God supremely and the last six present the requirement of loving our neighbors as
          ourselves. How many are truly, sincerely, and wholeheartedly doing this?</p>
      <p>The Lord is coming in a little while, and are we performing the duties that result from righteousness? Love is
          the basis of godliness. No man has love to God, no matter what his profession may be, unless he has unselﬁsh
          love for his brother. As we love God because He ﬁrst loved us, we shall love all for whom Christ died. We
          shall not feel like letting the soul who is in the greatest peril, and in the greatest need, go unwarned,
          unlabored for, and uncared for. We shall not feel like holding the erring off, and being critical and
          exacting, or letting them alone to plunge into further unhappiness and discouragement, and to fall on Satan’s
          battleground, for God will deal with us as He deals with our brethren or the younger members of the Lord’s
          family.</p>
      <p>Cultivate tenderness of heart; surround yourselves in your home life with the atmosphere of love. But the
          spirit that has largely pervaded the church is an offense to God. Everyone who has been free to condemn, to
          dishearten, and to discourage, who has failed to give tender kindness, sympathy, and compassion to the tempted
          and the tried, will in his own experience be brought over the ground which others have passed over, and
          suffered with their hardheartedness, and will feel what others have suffered because of his want of sympathy,
          until he shall abhor his hardness of heart and open the door for Jesus to come in.</p>
      <p>The converting power of God must come to every soul who has any connection with the work and cause of God that
          each one may be ﬁlled with the love and compassion of Christ or many will never see the kingdom of
          <nobr>heaven.—Manuscript</nobr> 62, August 18, 1894„ “Home Missionary Work.”</p>
