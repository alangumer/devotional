    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
          come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Revelation 22:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has given His church a special work of personal service to do. God could have sent angels to work for
          the reformation of man, but He did not do this. Humanity must touch humanity....</p>
      <p>Christ’s commission is to be received and acted upon. We are to go forth in faith, with earnest prayer for the
          presence of One who has said, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20). With
          the promise of such companionship, we are guilty of great unbelief and disobedience if we refuse to take up
          the cross of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce....</nobr> As we communicate</p>
      <p>the light that has found entrance to our souls, the Holy Spirit gives increased light, and our hearts are ﬁlled
          with the precious joy of the Lord....</p>
      <p>We have a cruciﬁed, risen Saviour to present to the people. All who have come to Jesus for pardon have found
          Him ever ready to take their sins, and to impute His righteousness to them. He who has come to Christ and has
          been truly converted will have a longing to save the souls that are out of Christ. He who loves God supremely
          and his neighbor as himself cannot rest content with doing nothing....</p>
      <p>God will use humble men as His instruments. Even though they have but one talent, if they trade upon it, it
          will increase. The great fault in the church is that the work of saving souls is so limited, that the
          advancement of the kingdom of God is slow. A backslidden church is the sure result of a selﬁsh church, a
          church that does not use her talents in the work of cooperating with Jesus to restore the moral image of God
          in man. We are to minister to every creature. A responsibility is laid upon us to work for all, our friends,
          our acquaintances, those that are bound up with the world and alienated from God. The apparently amiable and
          agreeable are to come into the sphere of our labors. The truth is for them as much as for us, and we must say,
          <nobr>“Come.”—Manuscript</nobr> 123, November 17, 1897„ “Christ’s Commission.”</p>
