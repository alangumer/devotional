    <h1>What God Expects</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.... Humble</strong></p>
      <p>yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. James <nobr>4:6-10.</nobr> When God entrusts men
          with responsibilities, He expects them to obey His</p>
      <p>law. They are to deal justly, realizing that the Lord beholds all their dealings with their fellow men, and
          that He will punish every unjust, oppressive action. God gives men opportunities to become one with Christ and
          one with Him. Those who walk in the fear of God, meditating upon His character, will daily become more and
          more like Christ. Those who choose not to know God will be ostentatious and boastful.</p>
      <p>There are many who put on what they think to be great dignity. But in God’s sight they are fools. They have not
          looked into the divine mirror, and they do not know how ridiculous is their pretension in the sight of a holy
          God. He who looks beneath the surface despises their <nobr>self-sufﬁciency.</nobr> They may hold positions of
          trust in the church or in the world, but so long as they continue to dishonor their Creator, making themselves
          the object of worship, they are an offense to Him.</p>
      <p>God does not take pleasure in punishing those who walk contrary to Him, giving a false representation of His
          character. But unless they repent, the time will come when they must reap the sure reward of their course of
          action....</p>
      <p>Those who have entered into a covenant to serve God are to fear lest their lives be such that they will not
          show the contrast between truth and error. They are not to turn aside to vain visions and human conjectures
          and ﬂatteries. The lives of the righteous are to put to shame those who refuse to offer their allegiance to
          God.... God calls upon His people to walk before Him</p>
      <p>in all humility. He would have them reach higher and still higher in spiritual knowledge. He holds out every
          inducement to lead men to return to their allegiance to Him....</p>
      <p>God is seeking to lead men to humble themselves. He tries to guide them to place their feet in the steps of the
          great Medical Missionary. But the Redeemer is often disappointed and cruciﬁed afresh by those professing so
          <nobr>much.—Letter</nobr> 61, February 1, 1904„ to “My Brethren Bearing Responsibilities.”</p>
