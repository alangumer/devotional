      <p><strong>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean
          men. Proverbs 22:29.</strong></p>
      <p>By the true follower of Christ every business transaction will be regarded as a part of his religion, just as
          prayer is a part of his religion. The study of the Scriptures will be considered a part of his religion, for
          by this he learns his orders. In the light of the Scriptures man regards himself as God’s servant, employed to
          do His will. Sometimes he ﬁnds these orders opposed to that which he would choose, were the decision left to
          him, but he does not ﬁnd fault with his work because of this. And as he seeks to carry out the will of the
          Master, angels of God are with him, to be his defense against the wiles of Satan. The word of God is to be our
          daily teacher. This is the only true source of comfort in all our trials, the only true source of
          encouragement and instruction in our labors.</p>
      <p>The Christian is to stand as a representative of the principles of heaven. He is bound by sacred obligations to
          represent the truth in its virtue and loveliness. Gentleness and kindness and strict truthfulness should mark
          his words and actions. Consecrated to God, set apart to His service, he will always honor his religious faith.
          No thread of selﬁshness is to be woven into the character. We are to educate ourselves to reveal the Spirit of
          God in all our lifework. The Spirit of God will never lead the steps of God’s children astray. Through the
          power that the Holy Spirit imparts, we may weed out from our lives every questionable thing. If we will come
          out of the darkness with which a lack of faith enshrouds the soul, and place ourselves where the clear shining
          of the light of God’s word can fall fully upon us, we shall be led step by step in the path that leads to
          holiness....</p>
      <p>It is our privilege, by an earnest study of the Word, to learn wherein we are not revealing the principles of
          that Word in our daily lives. And as the mirror reveals to us our defects, we are to seek by earnest prayer
          and faith to put them away, and come up to the standard that is given us. As we strive to meet the perfection
          that God desires for us, insensibly to us the image of God will be revealed in words and works and spirit. The
          human will become molded to the <nobr>divine.—Letter</nobr> 300, September 29, 1907„ to Elder O. A. Olsen,
          president of the Australasian Union Conference.</p>
