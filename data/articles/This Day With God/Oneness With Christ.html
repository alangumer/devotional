    <h1>Oneness With Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.... If</strong></p>
      <p>a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctiﬁed, and meet for the
          master’s use, and prepared unto every good work. 2 Timothy <nobr>2:19-21.</nobr></p>
      <p>Oneness with Christ depends on the renewing of the mind by the Holy Spirit. Thus we are strengthened to walk in
          newness of life, receiving from Christ the forgiveness of our sins. He who has that faith which works by love
          and puriﬁes the soul, is a cleansed vessel, sanctiﬁed and meet for the Master’s use. Self is dead....</p>
      <p>All disunion, all selﬁsh thoughts, words, and actions, are the fruit of the working of an unholy spirit upon
          the mind. Under the inﬂuence of this spirit, words are spoken which do not reveal the Saviour. Christ is not
          formed within, the hope of glory. Those who live thus are sinners, though they may be disguised as
          saints....</p>
      <p>Those who receive Christ are meek and lowly in heart. Christ opens within their hearts a living fountain of
          water, which springs up unto eternal life, refreshing the souls of others. The lives of those who eat the
          bread of life and drink the water of salvation are puriﬁed by the grace of God....</p>
      <p>Let all study the Word. Let not any man burden his soul with so many burdens that he cannot study the precious
          lessons Christ has given....</p>
      <p>The Word of God is not half comprehended. If each one would proclaim a fast for his own soul, studying the Word
          of God with earnest prayer, and reading only those books which would help him to gain a clearer knowledge of
          the Word, God’s people would have much more spiritual health and strength, much more spiritual knowledge and
          understanding, than they now reveal. We need to seek God, that we may ﬁnd Him precious to our souls. We need
          to keep Him as our abiding guest and companion, never parting from Him.</p>
      <p>To be one with Christ in God is the privilege of every soul. But in order to be this, we must be meek and
          lowly, teachable and obedient. Shall we not be of that number who make a business of securing by earnest
          prayer and faithful practice the faith that works by love and puriﬁes the <nobr>soul?—Letter</nobr> 75, May
          21, 1900„ to Elder G. A. Irwin, president of the General Conference.</p>
