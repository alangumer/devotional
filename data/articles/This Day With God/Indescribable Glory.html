    <h1>Indescribable Glory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye
          seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. Isaiah 64:4.</strong></p>
      <p>You [in response to a request by Mrs. Stewart, an artist, who asked Ellen White to write a description of the
          New Jerusalem.] express a desire for me to describe things concerning the New Jerusalem. I positively decline
          to do anything of the kind. My powers would be inadequate to do this or even make an approach to it, and I
          advise you not to make any attempt to have a particular representation which will carry the impression that it
          is the representation of the New Jerusalem. The most eloquent representation of the New Jerusalem is but</p>
      <p>...[an] attempt to present it.</p>
      <p>Anyone who is dealing with the future unseen world may best describe its untold glories by quoting the words of
          Paul, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
          prepared for them that love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9). I feel that many approach sacred things as though their
          ﬁnite powers were capable of taking them in....</p>
      <p>There is so large a number that tread on holy ground with unsanctiﬁed feet that we are very cautious, even in
          statements that we present to them in regard to sacred and eternal things, because ﬁnite and common ideas
          become mixed with the holy and sacred. Man may try with his entrusted and cultivated powers to represent
          something of heaven and he will make a blunder of the whole thing.</p>
      <p>Your power as an artist will, when stretched to its utmost capacity fall down faint and weary in seeking to
          take in the things of the unseen world, and yet there is an eternity beyond. With these statements you will
          excuse me from attempting to portray before you anything concerning the works of the great Master Artist.</p>
      <p>Let the imaginations of the people be on the highest stretch to contemplate the glories of the New Jerusalem
          and yet they have but just entered upon the borders of the eternal weight of glory that shall be realized by
          the faithful overcomer. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the ground whereon thou standeth is holy. This
          is the very best answer I can give to your <nobr>question.—Letter</nobr> 54, April 4, 1886„ to Sister
          Stewart.</p>
