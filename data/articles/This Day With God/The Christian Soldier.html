    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. Ephesians
          6:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord will work with every sincere, devoted soldier of the cross. But no man can be a good soldier who
          thinks he must work independently of his fellow worker, who regards his own judgment as the best. God’s
          workers must blend together, one supplying what the other lacks....</p>
      <p>Do we make the preparation it is our privilege to make to stand against the wiles of the enemy? Do we realize
          the sacred character of God’s work and the necessity of watching for souls as they that must give account? We
          must be vigilant, “knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
          nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works
          of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light” (Romans 13:11, 12).</p>
      <p>Are we learning to forego our own wishes? Or is self still consulted so much that in labor with our brethren we
          regard our judgment as best of all? God forbid that we should allow <nobr>self-supremacy</nobr> to withhold
          from us the blessings God gives to the meek and lowly. Those who truly glorify God will hide self in Christ,
          rejoicing if God can be gloriﬁed by the labors of those connected with them. No one can succeed in the work of
          God who has too high an appreciation of himself. As time goes on, his feeling of supremacy grows, and soon he
          comes to think that he would rather not unite with his brethren in labor, but would prefer to work
          alone....</p>
      <p>Let us put far from us every feeling of <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> Let us prepare to be good soldiers of the
          cross by learning the lesson Christ gave, when He said, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
          and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:29).</p>
      <p>He who has crushed down all desire for <nobr>self-recognition</nobr> will most surely be recognized by the
          unselﬁshness of his actions. In order to help and encourage others, he is willing to put aside his own wishes,
          becoming all things to all men that he may by some means save some. Such a man is a noble leader in Christ’s
          <nobr>army.—Letter</nobr> 67, April 26, 1900„ to Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, who were engaged in city
          evangelism.</p>
