    <h1>Choosing and Doing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live
          unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 1 Peter 2:24.</strong></p>
      <p>It is because He [Christ] has borne the punishment in His own body on the cross that man has a second
          probation. He may, if he will, return this loyalty. But, if he refuses to obey the commands of God, if he
          rejects the warnings and messages God sends, choosing rather the words of fallacy spoken by those who echo the
          word of the Deceiver, he is willingly ignorant, and the condemnation of God is upon him. He chooses
          disobedience because obedience means lifting the cross and practicing <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and following
          Christ in the path of obedience.</p>
      <p>The natural mind leans toward pleasure and <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation</nobr> and it is Satan’s policy to
          manufacture an abundance of this, that they may be ﬁlled with excitement, leaving men and women no time to
          consider the question, How is it with my soul? The love of pleasure is infectious. Given up to this, the mind
          hurries from one point to another, ever seeking for some amusement....</p>
      <p>The ability to enjoy the riches of glory will be developed in proportion to the desire we have for these
          riches. How shall an appreciation of God and heavenly things be developed unless it is in this life? If the
          claims and cares of the world are allowed to engross all our time and attention, our spiritual powers weaken
          and die because they are not exercised. In a mind wholly given to earthly things, every inlet through which
          light from heaven may enter, is closed. God’s transforming grace cannot be felt on mind and character. The
          talents which should be used in active piety, are ignored and neglected. How then can a response be made when
          the invitation is heard, “Come; for all things are now ready” (Luke 14:17)? How is it possible for a man to
          receive the commendation, “Well done, good and faithful servant,” when he has been disobedient, unthankful,
          unholy? He has trained the mind to disregard God’s plainest requirements, to dislike religious things. He
          loves the things of earth more than the things of heaven.</p>
      <p>Obedience to God’s commands will enroll our names in the Lamb’s book of life, “for we are made partakers of
          Christ” (Hebrews <nobr>3:14).—Manuscript</nobr> 28, March 19, 1899„ “Think Not That I Am Come to Destroy the
          Law.”</p>
