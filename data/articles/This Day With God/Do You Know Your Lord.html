    <h1>Do You Know Your Lord?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made
          him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. ... He that hath the Son hath life;
          and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 1 John <nobr>5:10-12.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>While we know Christ in one sense, that He is the Saviour of the world, it means more than this. We must have a
          personal knowledge and experience in Christ Jesus, an experimental knowledge of Christ, what He is to us, and
          what we are to Christ. That is the experience that everyone wants. Now, I cannot have it for any of you, nor
          can you have it for me. The work that is to be done for us, is to be through the manifestation of the Holy
          Spirit of God upon human minds and human hearts. The heart must be puriﬁed and sanctiﬁed.</p>
      <p>I need not tell any of you that it is so, because you know it. Not one of us needs to feel a doubt as to where
          we are, or to think, “I wish I knew where I stood before God,” but, by living faith, we must sink ourselves in
          God; and when we do that, His life will shine upon us. There is not a particle of need of our being in a state
          of inefﬁciency and coldness. What is the matter with us? “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
          giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” It shall be given him. There are
          no “ifs” nor “ands” about it. “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering” (James 1:5, 6).</p>
      <p>You pray, and ask God for wisdom, strength, and efﬁciency, and feel that you must have them. But perhaps, right
          after that prayer, it will seem as though a hellish shadow of Satan was cast right athwart your pathway, and
          you see nothing beyond. What was that? Why, the devil wanted to obscure your faith....</p>
      <p>But there is no necessity for you to do that. Is feeling to be our criterion, or is it to the word of the
          living God? Are we to sink our faith in the cloud? That is what Satan wants us to do....</p>
      <p>I have had that cloud settle upon me at times, but I knew that God was there just the same.... “Ask in faith,
          nothing wavering.” Don’t let one single suggestion</p>
      <p>of the devil come in. It is to be “nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea” (Verse 6).
          The Lord will do great things for us if we will only show our trust in <nobr>Him.—Manuscript</nobr> 93a, July
          23, 1899,.</p>
