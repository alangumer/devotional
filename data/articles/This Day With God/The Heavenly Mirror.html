    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
          image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18.</strong></p>
      <p>My dear brother, what have you been beholding? By beholding the imperfections of men and women, you are
          gradually becoming changed into the same likeness. Make a decided change, and look to Jesus, that by beholding
          His perfection, you may become changed into His image. Then His spirit will take possession of your mind and
          character. By your piety and godliness, by your words and actions, by your spiritual activity for truth and
          righteousness, you will represent Christ.</p>
      <p>When a man turns away from human imperfections, and beholds Jesus, a divine transformation takes place in his
          character. He ﬁxes his eye upon Christ as on a mirror which reﬂects the glory of God, and by beholding, he
          becomes “changed into the same image, from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2 Corinthians
          3:18). “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his” (Romans 8:9).</p>
      <p>Turn your eyes from the imperfections of others, and ﬁx them steadfastly on Christ. With a contrite heart,
          study His life and character. You need not only to be more enlightened, but quickened, that you may see the
          banquet that is before you, and eat and drink the ﬂesh and blood of the Son of God, which is His Word. By
          tasting the good Word of life, by feeding on the bread of life, you may see the power of a world to come, and
          be created anew in Christ Jesus. If you receive His gifts, you will be renewed unto holiness, and His grace
          will bring forth in you fruit unto the glory of God.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit reveals Christ to the mind, and faith takes hold of Him. If you accept Christ as your personal
          Saviour, you will know by experience the value of the great sacriﬁce made in your behalf upon the cross of
          Calvary. The Spirit of Christ, working upon the heart conforms it to His image; for Christ is the model upon
          which the Spirit works. By the ministry of His Word, by His providences, by His inward working, God stamps the
          likeness of Christ upon the soul.</p>
      <p>To possess Christ is your ﬁrst work, and to reveal Him as one who is able to save to the uttermost all who come
          to Him, is your next <nobr>work.—Manuscript</nobr> 10, February 7, 1897„ “Representing Christ.”</p>
