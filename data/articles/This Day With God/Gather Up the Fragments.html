    <h1>Gather Up the Fragments</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. John 6:12. This morning, or rather at twelve
          o’clock, I rose to adjust my blinds, which</strong></p>
      <p>were being blown by the wind; and I found the manuscript which I was to read before leaving on the six o’clock
          train for San Francisco, where I am to unite with Elder Corliss in labor during the week of prayer. With this
          manuscript was a letter from you to W. C. W. [White], which I read at midnight. This letter was of special
          interest to me, and after reading it, I could not think of sleeping; so I dressed, and am in my writing chair
          at this moment....</p>
      <p>I have felt more grateful than I can express for this pleasant refuge [Elmshaven, near St. Helena, California],
          for me in my old age. I do not feel any older than I did twenty years ago, but I do not count upon many years
          now, and I have a great desire to accomplish a work in preparing my writings so that, if I am suddenly
          removed, they will be in a proper shape for others to handle them, and thus carry out the
          <nobr>oft-repeated</nobr> instructions to me, “Gather up the fragments; let nothing be lost.” ...</p>
      <p>Here we have an abundance of fruit of all kinds. Our surroundings are very agreeable and pleasant to look upon.
          We have an abundance of pure water from the everlasting hills, and grapes in abundance....</p>
      <p>I will write no more now, but I hope you will both be situated where for a time you will not have to strain
          every nerve and muscle to their highest tension. It is not best to be in any way presumptuous. The Lord
          desires His worn servants to have a chance to be situated where they will have an opportunity to express with
          pen and voice the advantage of a broad experience, without sacriﬁcing their lives in the effort. By precept
          and example men should be educated to bear the strain of labor, and those who have hitherto borne the burdens
          should preserve the life God has given them to voice His <nobr>Word—“This</nobr> is the way; walk ye in
          it.”</p>
      <p>I will leave this right here. My watch says that it is three o’clock. In love, Ellen G.
          <nobr>White.—Letter</nobr> 161, December 20, 1900„ to Brother and Sister Druillard, who labored in Africa and
          were being invited to join Ellen White’s staff.</p>
