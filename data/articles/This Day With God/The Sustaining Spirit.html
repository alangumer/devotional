    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufﬁciency in all
          things, may abound to every good work. 2 Corinthians 9:8.</strong></p>
      <p>We [Ellen White was assisting with evening evangelistic meetings in san jose, California.] rise at ﬁve o’clock,
          eat at half past six, and then the men take the team to the tent and devote one hour and half to Bible class
          and talking together, comparing their experiences of the day previous, and are instructed in regard to the
          orderly habits they should cultivate and the necessity of overcoming every defect in character. This is a
          school for them which they all need very much.</p>
      <p>The L_____s are <nobr>good-spirited</nobr> boys, but have great <nobr>deﬁciencies—no</nobr> order, neglect the
          simplest duties in <nobr>care-taking,</nobr> leave things undone right before their faces. It is a time now
          for them to obtain a ﬁtness for the work or give it up and take up that part of their education which has
          received no attention, until they develop a <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> character. Until this is done they will
          never be ﬁt to go alone and do anything. We all need more of the Spirit of God, more earnest faith, more
          constant, earnest prayer that we may discern the grievous imperfections of our best works and our entire
          inability of ourselves to meet the divine standard.</p>
      <p>Oh, the greatness of the work to save souls! How few feel it! How few are doing all they can to gather souls to
          Christ! Satan is working with his <nobr>might—persevering,</nobr> diligent, <nobr>untiring—while</nobr> many
          who profess the truth are asleep, doing nothing to save souls, not even living the truth they profess. It is
          no tame testimony that will meet the people. We must reach the people through God. We must be ﬂexible in the
          hands of God, to be molded as clay in the hands of the potter. There is sufﬁciency in the grace of God for
          every hour of conﬂict, for every hour of trial. Let us take hold of God more ﬁrmly. His Spirit will help, His
          Spirit will strengthen and sustain.</p>
      <p>As we come nearer to God we shall be conscious of our own nothingness and learn to depend more upon Jesus
          Christ and then we shall obtain clear evidence of the love of Jesus. We shall see the goodness and mercy of
          God displayed in the orderings of His <nobr>providence.—Letter</nobr> 21, June 13, 1883„ to W. C. White.</p>
