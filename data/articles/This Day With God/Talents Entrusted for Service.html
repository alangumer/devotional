    <h1>Talents Entrusted for Service</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts
          differing according to the grace that is given to us. Romans 12:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>God has given to every man talents in trust. To every man He has given his work. There can be no idlers in His
          vineyard. Each has most earnest, sacred, solemn work to do for the Master. To everyone is committed some work
          to do, and none are excused. The day of ﬁnal account will come, when the Lord reckons with His servants. The
          Chief Shepherd is Judge and illustrates the great principles which are to regulate the proceedings of the
          reckoning with His servants who are justiﬁed by faith, judged by their works. Faith works by love and puriﬁes
          the soul of moral deﬁlement that it may become a temple for the Lord.</p>
      <p>The entrusted talents are not reserved for a favorite few who are exalted above their fellow men in education,
          in smartness of intellect. The talents are endowments bestowed upon the Lord’s family individually, from the
          lowliest and most obscure to those who are in highest positions of trust. The entrusted gifts are proportioned
          to our varied capabilities, and everyone is to use these talents to God’s glory. He is to increase their
          usefulness because through using them he becomes more and better qualiﬁed to trade on his Lord’s goods and to
          accumulate by trading. The light of truth and all spiritual advantages are the Lord’s gifts. They are to be
          appreciated and are to have inﬂuence upon the mind and character. We are to return to God corresponding
          increase, according to the gifts entrusted.</p>
      <p>We have by grace been chosen as His servants. A servant means a worker, one who bears cares, burdens,
          responsibilities.... We are to realize that it is not</p>
      <p>our goods we are handling, but the Master’s entrusted capital for us to invest and increase as wise stewards of
          our Lord’s goods, that we may return to Him His investment with usury. We cannot hoard the Lord’s goods and do
          nothing with it; thus did the slothful servant with his one pound, and lost his soul. Every man has a solemn
          work to do and he cannot triﬂe with his time; he cannot triﬂe with his privileges and his opportunities
          granted him. He must improve in character, in ability, according to his privileges and opportunities, to make
          a complete worker in the cause of <nobr>God.—Manuscript</nobr> 81, July 18, 1893,.</p>
