    <h1>Discernment of Duty</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing: and knowest not that thou
          art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. Revelation 3:17.</strong></p>
      <p>What is it that constitutes the wretchedness, the nakedness of those who feel rich and increased with
          <nobr>goods?—It</nobr> is the want of the righteousness of Christ. In their own righteousness they are
          represented as clothed with ﬁlthy rags, and yet in this condition they ﬂatter themselves that they are clothed
          upon with Christ’s righteousness. Could deception be greater? As is represented by the prophet, they may be
          crying, “The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we” (see Jeremiah 7:4), while their hearts are
          ﬁlled with unholy trafﬁc and unrighteous barter.</p>
      <p>The courts of the <nobr>soul-temple</nobr> may be the haunt of envy, pride, passion, evil surmising,
          bitterness, and hollow formalism. Christ looks mournfully upon His professed people who feel rich and
          increased in the knowledge of the truth, and who are yet destitute of the truth in life and character, and
          unconscious of their destitute condition. In sin and unbelief, they lightly regard the warnings and counsels
          of His servants, and treat His ambassadors with scorn and contempt, while their words of reproof are regarded
          as idle tales. Discernment seems to have departed, and they have no power to discriminate between the light
          which God sends them and the darkness that comes from the enemy of their souls....</p>
      <p>When Jesus went away, He intrusted to men His work in all its varied branches, and every true follower of
          Christ has some work to do for Him, for which he is responsible to his own Master, and that work he is
          expected to do with ﬁdelity, waiting for command and direction from his Leader. We are the responsible agents
          of God, and have been invested with the goods of heaven, and we should have an eye single to the glory of Him
          who has called us. On our part there should be a faithful execution of duty, doing our appointed task to the
          full measure of our intrusted capability. No living being can do our work for us. We must do our work through
          a diligent use of the intellect which God has given, gaining in knowledge and efﬁciency as we make progress in
          our <nobr>work.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August 7, 1894.</p>
