    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
          nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works
          of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Romans 13:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>We form a part of the great web of humanity, and a mutual inﬂuence passes from one to another, not only in the
          church but the family in heaven and the family on earth blend, in order that Christ may become a power in the
          world. All the jewels of truth given to patriarchs and prophets, which have been accumulating from age to age,
          and from generation to generation, are to be gathered up, as hereditary trusts.</p>
      <p>The sacred inﬂuences of present and past generations make a strong and powerful agency for God, able to stand,
          not against ﬂesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places.
          God’s people of today have all the privileges and opportunities of former generations and increased light to
          make them more powerful in the work of God than the people of preceding generations have been. These
          advantages demand corresponding returns. In harmony with our heavenly treasures are to be our efforts to open
          the way before others.</p>
      <p>The Lord is at hand. Heavenly intelligences united with sanctiﬁed inﬂuences of earth are to proclaim the third
          angel’s message and sound the warning, The end of all things is at hand. “For yet a little while, and he that
          shall come will come, and will not tarry” (Hebrews 10:37). A people are to be prepared to stand in the day of
          the Lord, and having done all, to stand. Those who crowd together in cities and villages are making a serious
          mistake. Those who thus neglect to extend their inﬂuence, by circulating wider and wider, reaching to the
          uttermost parts of the world are neglecting to stand at their post of duty....</p>
      <p>In His prayer for His disciples shortly before His ascension, Christ said, “Neither pray I for these alone, but
          for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in
          me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me” (John
          17:20, 21). Oh, that these blessed words may be written by the ﬁnger of God upon every
          <nobr>heart.—Manuscript</nobr> 7, June 10, 1891„ “Christian Service in the Living Church.”</p>
