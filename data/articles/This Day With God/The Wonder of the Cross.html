    <h1>The Wonder of the Cross</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received
          by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
          without spot. 1 Peter 1:18, 19.</strong></p>
      <p>This was a good day for the people in Iowa. Our meeting did not close until about one o’clock.... The precious
          gift of salvation and the redemption</p>
      <p>for all those who will accept it seemed so marvelous, so far beyond our ﬁnite conception, that language was
          tame and could not portray the inﬁnite blessings brought within our reach by the world’s Redeemer. His
          greatness condescended to our feebleness.</p>
      <p>Jesus, precious Saviour! We may study the love of the Father in that He gave His dear Son to die for a fallen
          world. As we study this inexpressible love in the light of the cross of Calvary, we are ﬁlled with wonder,
          with amazement. We see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness blended harmoniously with justice and dignity and
          power. Jesus bids the sinner to look to Him and live. “I,” He says, “have found a ransom.” The gulf of
          perdition opened by sin is bridged by the cross of Calvary. Penitent, believing souls may see a forgiving
          Father reconciling us to Himself by that cross of Calvary.</p>
      <p>The knowledge of Christ reveals the depths of sin and its offensive character, while by faith we see the
          cleansing stream, the blood of Christ which washes away every spot, every stain of sin. This salvation is not
          half appreciated. Salvation brought to us through the blood of Jesus is not estimated of priceless value. By
          faith this gift must be fully accepted as the great gift of God through Jesus Christ. The burden of our sins
          and of our sorrows was laid upon One who is merciful to pardon, mighty to save.</p>
      <p>Why are we so cold? Why are we worldly? Why are we so careless? Why does not the love of Jesus burn upon the
          altar of our hearts? He carried the burden of our sins, of our sorrows; why do we not have greater faith? Why
          do we not trust fully and receive by faith everything from that hand which was nailed to the cross that it
          might be all powerful to save? Why cannot we trust that love which has been expressed to us in such inﬁnite
          sacriﬁce that we might live?</p>
      <p>Look in faith to the cross. Look and live. This will be our study and song throughout
          <nobr>eternity.—Letter</nobr> 6, June 16, 1881„ to Edson and Emma White.</p>
