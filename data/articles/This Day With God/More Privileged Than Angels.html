    <h1>More Privileged Than Angels</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee,
          that thou mayest be feared. Psalm 130:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>To those who have made strange paths for their feet, the Lord offers words of encouragement. He will accept
          their prayers, if they will repent and be converted. Through the inﬁnite sacriﬁce of Christ, and through faith
          in His name, they may receive the promises of God. The sons of Adam may become sons of God. O how full of
          thankfulness we should be that by the act of Christ in assuming humanity, fallen men are granted a second
          trial! Christ places them on vantage ground. Through connection with Him they may be laborers together with
          God. Through the grace given daily by Christ, they may be elevated and ennobled to become the sons and
          daughters of God. Such love is without parallel.</p>
      <p>Jesus asks for perfect obedience. There must be thorough, practical work. Daily we are to increase in the
          knowledge of the divine will. Christ will impart His Spirit to all who will unitedly labor in humility.</p>
      <p>“Ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
          which are God’s” (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20). What a price was paid to redeem the fallen race! Should not every
          soul enter into the service of God, seeking to improve on the talents that have been entrusted to him, that
          they may be returned to God with usury?</p>
      <p>“Come unto me,” says Jesus, “all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
          upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and [in learning and practicing these lessons] ye
          shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:28, 29). If we would live a Christian life, we must constantly
          cooperate with God, losing self in dependence upon Jesus Christ. Every day we should work as for
          eternity.</p>
      <p>Man was made a little lower than the angels. Yet when he shall be puriﬁed and translated to the heavenly
          courts, he will be even more privileged than the angels.</p>
      <p>All that your brothers and sisters need, all that any of us need is to live a humble, Christian life, revealing
          in character the strength received from Jesus Christ through union with <nobr>Him.—Letter</nobr> 196,
          September 3, 1903„ to a businessman.</p>
