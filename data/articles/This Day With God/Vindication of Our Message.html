      <p><strong>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving
          heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
          with a hot iron. 1 Timothy 4:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>I am instructed that the Lord, by His inﬁnite power, has preserved the right hand of His messenger for more
          than half a century, in order that the truth may be written out as He bids me write it for publication, in
          periodicals and books, <nobr>Why?—Because</nobr> if it were not thus written out, when the pioneers in the
          faith shall die, there would be many, new in the faith, who would sometimes accept as messages of truth
          teachings that contain erroneous sentiments and dangerous fallacies. Sometimes that which men teach as
          “special light” is in reality specious error, which, as tares sown among the wheat, will spring up and produce
          a baleful harvest. And errors of this sort will be entertained by some until the close of this earth’s
          history.</p>
      <p>There are some, who upon accepting erroneous theories, strive to establish them by collecting from my writings
          statements of truth, which they use, separated from their proper connection and perverted by association with
          error. Thus seeds of heresy, springing up and growing rapidly into strong plants, are surrounded by many
          precious plants of truth, and in this way a mighty effort is made to vindicate the genuineness of the spurious
          plants.</p>
      <p>So it was with the heresies taught in Living Temple.[A book expressing pantheistic sentiments published by J.
          H. Kellogg.] The subtle errors in this book were surrounded by many beautiful truths.... The seductive
          fallacies of</p>
      <p>Satan undermined conﬁdence in the true pillars of the faith, which are grounded on Bible evidence. Truth is
          sustained by a plain “Thus saith the Lord.” But there has been a weaving in of error, and the use of
          scriptures out of their natural connection, in order to substantiate fallacies, which would deceive, if
          possible, the very elect....</p>
      <p>Let not the days pass by and precious opportunities be lost of seeking the Lord with all the heart and mind and
          soul. If we accept not the truth in the love of it, we may be among the number who will see the miracles
          wrought by Satan in these last days, and believe <nobr>them.—Letter</nobr> 136, April 27, 1906„ to Brethren
          Butler, Daniells, and Irwin.</p>
