    <h1>Price Tag of Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time. Ecclesiastes 3:11.</strong></p>
      <p>He [God] wants us to see the natural beauty in our world. He wants us to see this, and to educate our children
          to see that these are an expression of God’s love to man. Here is a voice speaking to you parents to soften
          and subdue your hearts. Keep ever before you the One that made heaven and earth, that clad the world with its
          green velvet carpet, that has given us the lofty trees and clad them in their green foliage. But instead of
          talking of the praise of the God that made all these, humanity talks of the things of human manufacture, and
          they think of their houses that are so beautiful and their dresses that are so richly adorned. All this takes
          time and money, and that means souls. God has given us money that we may expend it to His glory. Oh, if the
          curtain could be rolled back: if we could only get a sight of the love of God that passeth knowledge. I
          scarcely dare to touch it; I scarcely dare to mention the glory that is in reserve. For whom? Every soul that
          has been tested and tried and that has an eye single to the glory of God, that will be loyal to the truth of
          heaven. The world’s honor, the world’s glory, and the world’s applause are not worth anything to us.</p>
      <p>Every soul that believes in Jesus Christ as his personal Saviour, what then? Then the love ﬂows from the heart
          of God to his heart. What does that heart do then? It turns to serve God and keep His commandments lest it
          will be found as Adam and Eve were after their transgression. We cannot afford that. We cannot afford to sin.
          Sin is an expensive business....</p>
      <p>We want to enter the gates of the eternal city. When the pearly gates are thrown back we want to hear the voice
          of welcome. We want to have the crown of immortal glory placed upon our brow. We want that robe that is woven
          in the loom of heaven, white as no fuller on earth can white it; we want to see the King in His beauty and
          behold His matchless charms.... I beg of you to lay</p>
      <p>up your treasures in heaven. Rid yourself of everything that will so confuse your mind that you will not be
          able to distinguish between the sacred and the <nobr>common.—Manuscript</nobr> 20, March 18, 1894„ “Our
          Father’s Care for His Children.”</p>
