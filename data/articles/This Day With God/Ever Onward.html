      <p><strong>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
          Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will
          reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. John 16:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>It is through the mighty agency of the Holy Spirit that the government of Satan is to be subdued and subjected.
          It is the Holy Spirit that convinces of sin, and expels it from the soul by the consent of the human agent.
          The mind is then brought under a new law, and that law is the royal law of liberty. Jesus came to break the
          shackles of <nobr>sin-slavery</nobr> from the soul; for sin can triumph only when the liberty of the soul is
          extinguished. Jesus reached to the very depth of human woe and misery, and His love attracts man to Himself.
          Through the agency of the Holy Spirit, He lifts the mind up from its degradation, and fastens it upon the
          eternal reality. Through the merits of Christ man may be able to exercise the noblest powers of his being, and
          expel sin from his soul....</p>
      <p>As we walk in the commandments of God, we follow on in the way cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in.
          The faithful of all ages have walked in this path, and they have shone as lights in the world. In this age the
          light transmitted from them has been shining with increased brightness upon the path of those who are walking
          in darkness. Some have received the truth, believed and obeyed it. The light of the third angel’s message has
          penetrated into many a darkened mind. The light of the wisdom, the goodness, the mercy, and love of God has
          been shining forth through His holy Word. We are not in the place where our fathers were. Advanced light is
          shining upon us in these last days. We cannot be accepted of God; we cannot honor Him by rendering the same
          service, doing the same work that our fathers did.</p>
      <p>In order to be accounted guiltless before God, we must be as faithful in our time in following and obeying our
          light, as they were faithful in following and obeying the light that shone upon them. Of every individual
          member of His church, our heavenly Father requires faith and fruits according to the grace and light given.
          God cannot accept less. Every soul should place himself where the light will shine upon him. He should
          treasure every ray, that he may brighten and bless the souls of others with the
          <nobr>Heaven-sent</nobr><nobr>radiance.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 25, 1893.</p>
