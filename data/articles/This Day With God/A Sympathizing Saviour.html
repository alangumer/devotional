      <p><strong>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice.... Receive him
          therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold</strong></p>
      <p>such in reputation: because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death. Philippians
          <nobr>2:28-30.</nobr></p>
      <p>The apostle Paul, who had received many revelations from the Lord, met difﬁculties from various sources and
          amidst all his conﬂicts and discouragements, he did not lose his trust and conﬁdence in God. Under the special
          tuition of the Holy Spirit, his judgment was puriﬁed, reﬁned, elevated, sanctiﬁed. The devisings of human
          beings and of the enemy against him were to him a means of discipline and education, and he declares that thus
          he gained most excellent knowledge, because he made the Lord Jesus his dependence. “Yea doubtless,” he
          declares, “I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord”
          (Philippians 3:8)....</p>
      <p>Jesus feels every pang of sorrow felt by those who are consecrated to His service, and who, under great
          difﬁculties, are doing His work. Let us dwell upon the love of Jesus, that we may have courage and faith. The
          Lord lives and reigns. There will be unwise advisers who will try to confuse us, but let us look to Jesus, and
          trust in Him at all times. He has been our Helper, and He will continue to be our Helper.... I am sometimes
          greatly perplexed to know what to do, but I will</p>
      <p>not be depressed. I am determined to bring all the sunshine into my life that I possibly can.</p>
      <p>The debt that I have incurred in trying to advance the cause of God sometimes worries me. I became involved in
          debt in trying to push forward the work in Australia. The publication of Desire of Ages was a heavy expense,
          and I still owe the publishing houses something....</p>
      <p>The house I now live in was paid for with borrowed money. I am just as willing to dispose of my place as I was
          to buy it. I have no abiding place in this world. When the Lord says, “Go, and build up the work in new
          places,” I shall gladly go....</p>
      <p>My trust is unwavering. I am not discouraged, because I can hold to the hand of Christ. Let us be always
          cheerful, that others may not catch from us the spirit of <nobr>discouragement.—Letter</nobr> 127, July 1,
          1903„ to Elder S. N. Haskell, for long years an associate worker of Ellen White’s, at the time working in city
          evangelism.</p>
