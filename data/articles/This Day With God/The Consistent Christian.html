    <h1>The Consistent Christian</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.... If we walk in the light,</strong></p>
      <p>as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us
          from all sin. 1 John <nobr>1:5-7.</nobr></p>
      <p>It is the privilege of the Christian to connect with the Source of light, and through this living connection
          become the light of the world. Christ’s true followers will walk in the light as He is in the light and
          therefore they will not travel in an uncertain way, stumbling because they walk in darkness. The Great Teacher
          is impressing upon His hearers the blessing which they may be to the world, represented as the sun rising in
          the east, dispelling the mist and the shadows of darkness. The dawn gives place to day. The sun, gilding,
          tinting, and then glorifying the heavens with its blaze of light is a symbol of the Christian life. As the
          light of the sun is light and life and blessing to all that live, so should Christians, by their good works,
          by their cheerfulness and courage, be the light of the world. As the light of the sun chases away the shades
          of night and pours its glories on valleys and hills, so will the Christians reﬂect the Sun of Righteousness
          which shines on him.</p>
      <p>Before the consistent lives of Christ’s true followers, ignorance, superstition, and darkness will pass away,
          as the sun dispels the gloom of night. In like manner the disciples of Jesus will go into the dark places of
          the earth, disseminating the light of truth until the pathway of those in darkness shall be illuminated by the
          light of truth.</p>
      <p>In what contrast to this is the life of the professed child of God who is as the salt without the savor. He has
          no vital connection with God and, like the worthless <nobr>salt—which</nobr> Christ describes as being
          thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of <nobr>men—he</nobr> has no saving
          properties. Thus is the life of a professed follower of Christ if he has not a living connection with Jesus
          Christ. These sunless professors are shadows of darkness....</p>
      <p>Every expression of doubt strengthens unbelief. Every thought and word of hope, courage, light, and love
          strengthens faith and fortiﬁes the soul to withstand the moral darkness that exists in the world. Those who
          talk faith will have faith, and those who talk discouragements will have discouragements. By beholding we
          become <nobr>changed.—Letter</nobr> 16, March 24, 1880„ to a General Conference ofﬁcer.</p>
