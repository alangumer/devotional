    <h1>Dallying With Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants,
          and warmed himself at the ﬁre. Mark 14:54.</strong></p>
      <p>No one should venture or presume upon the mercy of God, feeling at liberty to sin as much as they dare, and not
          abandon the hope that God will ﬁnally pardon and save. It is a sad resolve to follow Christ as far off as
          possible, venturing as near the verge of perdition as possible without falling in.</p>
      <p>It was a great sacriﬁce Christ made for man in dying for him upon the cross. What are we willing to sacriﬁce
          for His love? Jesus says, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John <nobr>14:15)—not</nobr> to select out
          one or two or nine, but the whole <nobr>ten—all</nobr> His commandments must be kept. John tells us of those
          who pretend to love but do not obey God’s requirements. “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
          commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him” (1 John 2:4). “For this is the love of God, that we keep
          his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous” (chap. 5:3)....</p>
      <p>Jesus was among the lowly of the earth. He did not take His position by the side of the learned rabbis or the
          rulers. He was not found among the potentates of earth, but among the lowly ones. The truth was never found
          among the majority. It was ever found among the minority.</p>
      <p>The angels from heaven did not come to the school of the prophets and sing their anthems over the temple or
          synagogues, but they went to the men who were humble enough to receive the message. They sang the glad tidings
          of a Saviour over Bethlehem’s plains, while the great men, the rulers, and honorable men were left in
          darkness, because they were perfectly satisﬁed with their position and felt no need of a piety greater than
          that which they possessed....</p>
      <p>Great men and professedly very good men may do terrible deeds in their bigotry and <nobr>self-exalted</nobr>
          position, and ﬂatter themselves that they are doing God service. It will not do to rely upon them. Truth,
          Bible truth, you and I want at any cost. Like the noble Bereans, we want to search the Scriptures daily, with
          earnest prayer, to know what is truth, and then obey the truth at any cost to ourselves, without reference to
          the great men or good <nobr>men.—Letter</nobr> 35, November 6, 1877„ to Caroline Clough, a
          <nobr>non-Adventist</nobr> relative.</p>
