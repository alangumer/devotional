    <h1>Are You Building on the Rock?</h1>

      <p><strong>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians
          3:11.</strong></p>
      <p>As the people sat upon the hillside, listening to the words of Christ, they could see valleys and ravines
          through which the mountain streams found their way to the sea. In summer these streams often wholly
          disappeared, leaving only a dry and dusty channel. But when the wintry storms burst upon the hills, the rivers
          became ﬁerce, raging torrents, at times overspreading the valleys, and bearing everything away on their
          resistless ﬂood. Often, then, the hovels reared by the peasants on the grassy plain, apparently beyond reach
          of danger, were swept away. But high upon the hill were houses built upon the rock. In some parts of the land
          were dwellings built wholly of rock, and many of them had withstood the tempests of a thousand years. These
          houses were reared with toil and great difﬁculty. They were not easy of access, and their location appeared
          less easy of access than the grassy plain. But they were founded upon the rock; and wind and ﬂood and tempest
          beat upon them in vain.</p>
      <p>Those who hear and obey the words of Christ are building upon the rock, and when the tempest comes, their house
          will not be overthrown. They will through faith in Christ Jesus gain eternal life. Those who are hearers but
          not doers of His words, are building upon a foundation of uncertainty which is sand, and calamity will
          overtake them.</p>
      <p>Had Adam and Eve heeded the words that God spoke to them in the beginning, they would not have fallen from
          their ﬁrst estate. Our Saviour met temptation in a stronger, ﬁercer form than it was presented to Adam, and
          His only weapon was one that is within the reach of <nobr>all—the</nobr> Word of God. When Satan came to
          Christ in His weakness, and told Him to satisfy His hunger by turning the stones into bread, and thus prove
          Himself to be the Son of God, Christ answered, “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
          word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4)....</p>
      <p>We shall meet with false doctrines of every kind, and unless we are acquainted with what Christ has said, and
          are following His instruction, we shall be led <nobr>astray.—Manuscript</nobr> 27, July 25, 1886„ “Building on
          the Rock.”</p>
