    <h1>Take Time to be Holy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience
          and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. Romans 15:4.</strong></p>
      <p>We say to every soul, Study your Bible, as you have never studied it before....</p>
      <p>Let the afﬁrmative of truth come forth from human lips, under the dictation of the Holy Spirit. I beg of all to
          watch and pray, lest they enter into temptation.</p>
      <p>The work going on in the world means much to us all. It is now as it was when the message was given in Noah’s
          day, and the invitation went forth for all who would to enter the ark. We know not how soon the last message
          of warning may be given, and our cases ﬁxed for eternity. But the Lord is gracious, and He presents the
          invitation, “Come; for all things are now ready” (Luke 14:17).</p>
      <p>There was hope for all the inhabitants of the Noachic world to enter the ark before the door was closed. After
          it was closed, those who entered were severely tried, for they were in the ark a full week before the rain
          came. O what fearful scofﬁng and mocking and deﬁance of God there was by those who had refused to enter! But
          after the week was ended, the rain began to fall gently. This was a new thing. The rain continued until every
          living thing was destroyed from the face of the earth. But one <nobr>family—the</nobr> family that entered the
          <nobr>ark—was</nobr> saved.</p>
      <p>We need now to be prepared for the closing scenes of this earth’s history. Let all search their own hearts
          diligently and be converted, that their sins may be pardoned. The world is becoming more and more decidedly
          opposed to God and to the truth of God. All who will do the will of God will be successful in obtaining
          knowledge and their experience will be valuable. We must now prepare to do a great work in a short time. We
          must have an individual experience, and, if we will come to the Lord in humility, He will be found of us, and
          He will work with us, and His salvation will be revealed.</p>
      <p>Day and night I have been sending my prayers up to the Lord.... I have been</p>
      <p>weighed down as I have thought of the situation of those who have had such great light, and yet have gone
          steadily on step by step in rejection of light.... I</p>
      <p>long to see the unbelief break. I long to see Satan defeated and expelled.... I am</p>
      <p>holding on by the gift of <nobr>faith.—Letter</nobr> 84, February 17, 1906„ to Elder and Mrs. E. W. Farnsworth,
          laboring in Battle Creek, Michigan.</p>
