    <h1>Giving as We Receive</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now
          herewith, saith the Lord of hosts. Malachi 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The end is fast approaching and many in our churches are asleep. Let all now make it their chief business to
          serve the Lord. The Lord has entrusted to His people the talent of means, some more and some less than others.
          With many the possession of wealth has proved a snare. In their desire to follow the fashions of the world,
          they have lost their zeal for the truth, and they are in peril of losing eternal life. In proportion as God
          has prospered them, men should return to Him of the goods He has entrusted to their stewardship....</p>
      <p>Let all carefully examine their business relations with their Creator. Those who will not hesitate to deal
          treacherously with their Maker will certainly not hesitate to deal treacherously with their fellow men.</p>
      <p>I desire to impress upon all our people that God regards the withholding of tithes and offerings as robbery. We
          are merely stewards of God; we do not own the money which passes into our hands. In its disbursement we are to
          be colaborers with Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We should feel an intense interest in the advancement of the work of God. This work has already grown to large
          proportions, but it is to advance still more rapidly. We need many more laborers, and there must be with all a
          spirit of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> in order to provide facilities for the carrying forward of the message
          into new ﬁelds. In many places the work has been greatly retarded because of a scarcity of means. The rebuke
          of God will rest upon those who do not come up to His help....</p>
      <p>In the great work of warning the world, those who have the truth in their heart and are sanctiﬁed through the
          truth, will act their assigned part. They will be faithful in the payment of tithes and offerings. Every
          church member is bound by covenant relation to God to deny himself of every extravagant outlay of means. Let
          not the want of economy in the home life render us unable to act our part in strengthening the work already
          established and in entering new <nobr>territory.—Manuscript</nobr> 103, December 6, 1906„ “Gifts and
          Offerings.”</p>
