    <h1>The Holy Spirit—The Gift of Gifts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
          of the cross. Philippians 2:8.</strong></p>
      <p>In proportion to Christ’s humiliation and suffering is His exaltation. He could have become the Saviour, the
          Redeemer, only by ﬁrst being the Sacriﬁce. What a mystery there is in the godliness of Christ. Having magniﬁed
          the law and made it honorable by accepting its conditions in saving a world from ruin, Christ hastened to
          heaven to perfect His work, and to accomplish His mission by sending the Holy Spirit to His disciples. Thus He
          would assure His believing ones that He had not forgotten them, though now in the presence of God, where there
          is fullness of joy forevermore.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit was to descend on those in this world who loved Christ. By this they would be qualiﬁed, in and
          through the gloriﬁcation of their Head, to receive every endowment necessary for the fulﬁlling of their
          mission. The <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> held in His hands, not only the keys of death, but a whole heaven of rich
          blessings. All power in heaven and earth was given to Him, and having taken His place in the heavenly courts,
          He could dispense these blessings to all who receive Him.</p>
      <p>Christ has said to His disciples, “It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter
          will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you” (John 16:7). This was the gift of gifts.
          The Holy Spirit was sent as the most priceless treasure man could receive. The church was baptized with the
          Spirit’s power. The disciples were ﬁtted to go forth and proclaim Christ, ﬁrst in Jerusalem, where the
          shameful work of dishonoring the rightful King had been done, and then to the uttermost parts of the
          earth....</p>
      <p>How full and free are the blessings to be bestowed on all who come to God in the name of His Son. If they will
          observe the conditions laid down in His Word, He will open to them the windows of heaven, and pour them down a
          blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.... If God’s people will</p>
      <p>sanctify themselves by obedience to His precepts, the Lord will work in their midst. He will renew humble,
          contrite souls, making their characters pure and <nobr>holy.—Manuscript</nobr> 128, November 28, 1897„ “The
          Only True Mediator.”</p>
