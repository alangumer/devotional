    <h1>In His Steps</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained
          that we should walk in them. Ephesians 2:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord does not accept the service of those who live an inefﬁcient, <nobr>do-nothing</nobr> life. They exert
          an inﬂuence that leads away from Christ. <nobr>Self-denial</nobr> and nobility of purpose marked His life.
          From the beginning to the close of His earthly ministry He went about doing good. In His life no sin appeared.
          No selﬁshness marred word or act. “Which of you convinceth me of sin?” (John 8:46), He asked the Pharisees,
          knowing that they could ﬁnd nothing of which to accuse Him. And at His trial, Pilate declared emphatically, “I
          ﬁnd in him no fault at all” (John 18:38).</p>
      <p>Christ declares that as He lived, so we are to live. “Whosoever will come after me,” He says, “let him deny
          himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Mark 8:34). His footsteps lead along the pathway of
          sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>As we pass through life, there come to us many opportunities for service. All around us there are open doors
          for ministry. By the right use of the talent of speech, we may do much for the Master. Words are a power for
          good when they are weighted with the tenderness and sympathy of Christ. Money, inﬂuence, tact, time, and
          <nobr>strength—all</nobr> these are gifts entrusted to us to make us more helpful to those around us, and more
          of an honor to our Creator.</p>
      <p>Many feel that it would be a privilege to visit the scenes of Christ’s life on earth, to walk where He trod, to
          look upon the lake where He loved to teach, and the valleys and hills where His eyes so often rested; but we
          need not go to Palestine in order to walk in the steps of Jesus. We shall ﬁnd His footprints beside the
          sickbed, in the hovels of poverty, in the crowded alleys of the great city, and in every place where there are
          human hearts in need of consolation.</p>
      <p>All may ﬁnd something to do. “The poor always ye have with you” (John 12:8), Jesus said, and none need feel
          that there is no place where they can labor for Him....</p>
      <p>Christ’s rule of life, by which everyone must stand or fall in the judgment, is, “Whatsoever ye would that men
          should do to you, do ye even so to them” (Matthew <nobr>7:12).—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 29,
          1912.</p>
