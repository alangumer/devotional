    <h1>No Sleeping on the Job</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth,
          and give them warning from me. Ezekiel 3:17.</strong></p>
      <p>God has a position of duty for each one of you. He requires you to be not only faithful sentinels, but thorough
          workmen. Never become uninterested, never careless and inactive; never sleep at your post, and never fail to
          perform your exact duty in accordance with your position of trust.</p>
      <p>There is need of alacrity, promptness, even earnest energy, deep interest, and unwavering ﬁdelity. You should
          learn to spring to the work at the call of duty. How long will be our allotted time to work, we know not. This
          is a secret with God, and for wise purposes, withheld from us. But what time we have to labor, let us employ
          it as those who must give an account. Oh, think earnestly, and in view of eternity, how much there is to be
          done in our world to arouse the mind of the careless, inattentive, and ignorant to become acquainted with the
          laws of God, and make them feel the necessity for their own good and God’s glory, of obedience to these laws.
          For transgression brings, not only great suffering, but loss of life in this world, and immortal life in the
          next world. You should consider this matter thoroughly, and feel how much the bliss or woe of men and women is
          dependent upon you.</p>
      <p>Faithfulness on your part may save many souls, while negligence and carelessness may result in the loss to your
          fellow creatures of both the present and the future life. You can prevent much misery and much transgression
          of God’s law by your ﬁdelity, by being wide awake at your post of duty.... We</p>
      <p>must arise as one, and in the power and strength of God, open our senses to the demands of the present
          time....</p>
      <p>Cry to God in faith, that He may pour out His light and His grace through the channels which He has appointed
          for good to those who are suffering for want of knowledge. While you pray and watch with earnest diligence to
          suppress wrong and stand guard against dissipation and fashionable errors, lay hold by living faith of the
          strength which may be yours to bless all your labors. You may gather light, knowledge, and power; and your
          inﬂuence may be diffusive....</p>
      <p>Every responsibility you bear will fortify and strengthen you to make renewed efforts and push forward the work
          <nobr>successfully.—Letter</nobr> 4a, January 12, 1879„ to two young physicians at Battle Creek
          Sanitarium.</p>
