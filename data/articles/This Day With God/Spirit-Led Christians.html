    <h1>Satan Is Not Dead</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from evil.
          John 17:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan is not dead or palsied, and he prepares minds by degrees to become imbued with his spirit, and to work
          after the same manner as he works against those who bear responsibilities in the work of God for these last
          days. In the future Satan’s last exploits will be carried out with more power than ever before. He has learned
          much, and he is full of scientiﬁc scheming to make of no effect the work that is under the supervision of the
          One who came to the Isle of Patmos to educate John, and to give him instruction to be given to the
          churches....</p>
      <p>Every ingenious device will be used, every possible method taken advantage of, to lead men to live a lie, that
          the truth shall not stand as God designed it to stand, to prepare a people, through the sanctiﬁcation of the
          Holy Spirit, to stand ﬁrm as a rock to principle....</p>
      <p>There are those who do not humble their hearts before God, and who will not walk uprightly. They hide their
          true purposes, and keep in fellowship with the fallen angel, who loveth and maketh a lie. The enemy puts his
          spirit upon the men whom he can use to deceive those who are partially in the dark....</p>
      <p>“Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not
          with strong drink. For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes:
          the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered” (Isaiah 29:9, 10). A spiritual drunkenness is upon
          many who suppose they are the people who shall be exalted. Their religious faith is just as is represented in
          this scripture. Under its inﬂuence, they cannot walk straight.... They are scientiﬁc schemers, and those who
          could</p>
      <p>and should have helped, because of a clear spiritual eyesight, are themselves deceived, and are sustaining an
          evil work.</p>
      <p>The developments of these last days will soon become decided. When these spiritualistic deceptions are revealed
          to be what they really <nobr>are—the</nobr> secret workings of evil <nobr>spirits—those</nobr> who have acted
          a part in them will become as men who have lost their <nobr>minds.—Letter</nobr> 311, October 30, 1905„ to
          Brethren Daniells and Prescott and their associates.</p>
