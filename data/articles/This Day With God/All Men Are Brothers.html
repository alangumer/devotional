    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God that made the world and all things therein ...hath made of one blood all nations of men. Acts
          <nobr>17:24-26.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>God has shown for human beings an inﬁnite depth of love, and yet how far short we fall of appreciating this
          love. Christ died on the cross of Calvary that sinners might be redeemed from the slavery of sin and placed on
          vantage ground before God. Think of the wonderful love that the Father revealed in making this sacriﬁce. It is
          ours to point those outside the fold to this love, ours to tell sinners what Christ has done for them, and
          what they may become through His transforming grace.</p>
      <p>We desire that in all that is done, the Lord’s name shall be gloriﬁed, and His cause advanced. Never was there
          a time when wise generalship was so much needed as at the present time. Human prejudice is not of God. To be
          guided by impulse is very dangerous. Human impulse is a poor commodity and cannot take the place of sanctiﬁed
          reason.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus is looking upon every soul with intense interest. He has declared that the spiritual character
          of His church is to be carefully maintained. The church is in the world, and is to do a work for the world,
          but the doors of the church are not to be opened to worldliness. “Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath
          not planted, shall be rooted up” (Matthew 15:13). The church must be strictly guarded. Its sacred character
          must be demonstrated to the world. “Ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building” (1 Corinthians 3:9). “Work
          out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
          his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:12, 13)....</p>
      <p>Today the truth is to be proclaimed to all nations and kindreds and tongues and peoples. Christ desires us to
          labor in a way that will not arouse prejudice, for when prejudice is aroused, some are cut off from hearing
          the truth....</p>
      <p>We are still in this world, where these barriers exist, and we must work in a way that will enable us to reach
          all classes. Let not the present obstructions worry you and destroy your faith and conﬁdence in
          <nobr>God.—Manuscript</nobr> 114, September 17, 1904„ “Directions Regarding Work for Colored People.”</p>
