      <p><strong>Ye are the salt of the earth. Matthew 5:13.</strong></p>
      <p>God requires those who claim to believe the Bible, the standard of Christian character, to bring the
          <nobr>Christ-likeness</nobr> into all their service, that not one particle of the salt shall lose its
          preserving inﬂuence. The <nobr>Christ-likeness</nobr> is ever to be preserved. The mind and heart are to be
          cleansed from all sin, all unlikeness to Christ.</p>
      <p>God has duties for everyone in His service, for every church member, to perform. His people are to exalt the
          power of the law above human judgment. By bringing the entire being, body, soul, and spirit, into harmony with
          the law, they are to establish the law.</p>
      <p>God will open the way for His subjects to perform unselﬁsh actions in all their associations, in all their
          business transactions with the world. By their acts of kindness and love, they are to show that they are
          opposed to greed and selﬁshness, and are representing the kingdom of heaven in our world. By
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> by sacriﬁcing the gain they might obtain, they are to avoid sin, that in accordance
          with the laws of God’s kingdom they may represent the truth in all its beauty.</p>
      <p>But if our words and actions are unChristlike; if the spirit we cherish is not helpful; if we retain the old,
          unsavory traits of character, studying how we may get the best of the bargain, to the disadvantage of someone
          else; if, unmindful that it is our duty to help one another, we care little whether we hurt and destroy a
          brother’s prospects, we are as salt which has lost its <nobr>savor—good</nobr> for nothing but to be cast out
          and trodden underfoot as valueless. We may gain some advantage ourselves, but what help are we to the
          world?</p>
      <p>How can we have preservative qualities of character, as salt which retains its savor? How can we exert a saving
          inﬂuence? By obeying to the letter in every transaction of life, the plain commands of God; by being kind,
          benevolent, generous; by seeing the necessities of the cause of God, and trying to relieve them; by doing the
          work that must be done to represent the truth as it is in <nobr>Jesus.—Letter</nobr> 79, July 11, 1901„ to A.
          G. Daniells, newly elected president of the General Conference.</p>
