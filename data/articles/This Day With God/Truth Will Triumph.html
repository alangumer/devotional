    <h1>Truth Will Triumph</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth
          commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 2 Corinthians 4:2.</strong></p>
      <p>There is to be no undermining of the fundamental truths that the Lord has submitted by many miraculous
          evidences. A voice is to be heard in clear afﬁrmation of the truth, in contradiction to the skepticism and
          fallacies that have been coming in from the enemy of truth. Reformations will take place, and the working out
          of the principles of divine truth will reveal growth in grace, for the divine agencies are efﬁcient to
          enlighten and sanctify the human understanding.</p>
      <p>The truth as it is in Jesus, as it was proclaimed by Him when He was enshrouded by the billowy cloud, is verity
          and truth in this our day, and will just as surely renovate the mind of the receiver as it has renovated minds
          in the past. Christ has declared, “If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
          though one rose from the dead” (Luke 16:31).</p>
      <p>As a people, we must prepare the way of the Lord, under the overruling guidance of the Holy Spirit, for the
          spread of the gospel in its purity. The stream of living water is to deepen and widen in its course. In all
          ﬁelds, nigh and afar off, men will be called from the plow and from the more common commercial business
          vocations that largely occupy the mind, and will become educated in connection with men who have had
          <nobr>experience—men</nobr> who understand the truth. Through most wonderful workings of God, mountains of
          difﬁculty will be removed and cast into the sea....</p>
      <p>Those who preach the truth will strive to demonstrate the truth by a <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life and godly
          conversation. And as they do this, they will become powerful in advocating the truth and in giving it the sure
          application that God has given it....</p>
      <p>The call is to go forth, “Son, go labor today in My vineyard.” As this call is obeyed, the message that means
          so much to the dwellers on the earth, will be heard and understood. Men will know what is truth. Onward, and
          still onward, will the work advance. And marked events of Providence will be seen and recognized, in judgments
          and in blessings. The truth will bear away the <nobr>victory.—Letter</nobr> 230, July 5, 1906„ to the elders
          of the Battle Creek church and to ministers and physicians.</p>
