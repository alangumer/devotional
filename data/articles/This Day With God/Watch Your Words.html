    <h1>Watch Your Words</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is written.... It is written again.... For it is written. Matthew <nobr>4:4-10.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Some who in times past have been honored of God, have become ensnared by the deceptions of the enemy. They have
          been warned of their danger, but in refusing to hear the warnings sent them, they have become more and more
          deceived, until ﬁnally they are found ﬁghting against the Lord and against His workers.</p>
      <p>Those who stand upon the rock of eternal truth will sometimes meet such opposition as will call for very
          decided action. At such times let every word be carefully weighed, lest you injure the souls of those you
          desire to help. Keep your tongue as with a bridle. Remember that God has not given to you the work of judging
          your brethren....</p>
      <p>From the Word of God gather all the comfort and encouragement possible, and present this to souls struggling
          with perplexities and difﬁculties. But never bring a railing accusation against those who are
          deceived....</p>
      <p>In meeting the enemy in the wilderness, Christ’s response to his wicked insinuations was, “It is written.” When
          Satan presumed to claim the ownership of the whole world, and asked Christ to worship him as God, He who with
          a word might have called to His assistance legions of angels, merely said, “Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
          written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve” (Matthew 4:10). The intensity of
          this conﬂict we but partly understand. It seemed as though the Saviour would die on the ﬁeld of battle, but He
          withstood the wily foe. His words so carefully chosen, were as sharp as a <nobr>two-edged</nobr> sword. Satan
          was thoroughly repulsed. He realized that the Prince of Life could not be deceived by any sophistry.</p>
      <p>We are now upon the ﬁeld of conﬂict....</p>
      <p>Let the Word of God be our study....</p>
      <p>To as many as believe in Him, Christ gives power to become the sons of God. Those who are thus denominated as
          members of the royal family will live for Him who is the propitiation for their sins. As they follow on to
          know the truth, their feet are planted on the sure foundation. Neither ﬂood nor storm can sweep away their
          <nobr>foundation.—Letter</nobr> 289, September 13, 1905„ to “My Brethren in the Ministry.”</p>
