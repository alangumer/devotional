    <h1>Think on These Things</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. Psalm
          1:6.</strong></p>
      <p>If the mind is educated to contemplate heavenly things, the appetite will not be satisﬁed with that which is
          cheap and common. We must bear in mind that the Lord is prepared to do great things for us, but we must be
          prepared to receive these things by emptying from the heart all <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> and
          <nobr>self-conﬁdence.</nobr> The Lord alone is to be exalted. “Them that honour me,” He says, “I will honour”
          (1 Samuel 2:30). We need not be on the strain for recognition, for “the Lord knoweth them that are his.” Those
          who do not put conﬁdence in themselves, but look with distrust upon their own work, are the ones to whom the
          Lord will reveal His glory. They will make the best use of the blessings received. All who drink of the pure
          streams of Lebanon, will have the water of life springing up in them, and this cannot be repressed....</p>
      <p>The Lord knows that if we look to man, and trust to man, we are leaning on an arm of ﬂesh. He invites our
          conﬁdence. There is no limit to His power. Think of the Lord Jesus, and His merits and His love, but do not
          seek to ﬁnd the defects and dwell upon the mistakes that others have made. Call to your mind the things worthy
          of your recognition and your praise; and if you are sharp to discern errors in others, be more sharp to
          recognize the good and praise the good. You may, if you criticize yourself, ﬁnd things just as objectionable
          as that which you see in others. Then let us work constantly to strengthen one another in the most holy
          faith.</p>
      <p>In Paul’s epistle to the Philippians, he says, “Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
          saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: Grace be unto you, and peace, from
          God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every
          prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the ﬁrst day until
          now; being conﬁdent of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the
          day of Jesus Christ” (Philippians <nobr>1:1-6).</nobr> Let us all make this spirit
          <nobr>ours.—Manuscript</nobr> 187, October 18, 1898„ diary.</p>
