    <h1>Separating From Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right
          hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. Colossians 3:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The requirements of God are set plainly before us, and the question to be settled is, Will we comply with them?
          Will we accept the conditions laid down in His <nobr>Word—separation</nobr> from the world? This is not the
          work of a moment or of a day. It is not accomplished by bowing at the family altar, and offering up lip
          service, neither by public exhortation and prayer. It is a lifelong work. Our consecration to God must be a
          living principle, interwoven with the life, and leading to <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> It must underlie all our thoughts and be the spring of every action. This will
          elevate us above the world, and separate us from its polluting inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>All our actions are affected by our religious experience, and if this experience is founded on God and we
          understand the mysteries of godliness, if we are daily receiving of the power of the world to come, and hold
          communion with God, and have the fellowship of the Spirit, if we are each day holding with a ﬁrmer grasp the
          higher life, and drawing closer and still closer to the bleeding side of the Redeemer, we shall have inwrought
          in us principles that are holy and elevating. Then it will be as natural for us to seek purity and holiness
          and separation from the world, as it is for the angels of glory to execute the mission of love assigned them
          in saving mortals from the corrupting inﬂuence of the world. Every one who enters the pearly gates of the city
          of God will be a doer of the Word. He will be a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption
          that is in the world through lust. It is our privilege to realize the fulness there is in Christ, and be
          blessed by the provision made through Him. Ample provision has been made that we should be raised from the
          lowlands of earth, and have our affections fastened upon God and heavenly things.</p>
      <p>Will this separation from the world in obedience to the divine command, unﬁt us for doing the work the Lord has
          left us? Will it hinder us from doing good to those around us? No; the ﬁrmer hold we have on heaven, the
          greater will be our power of usefulness in the <nobr>world.—Manuscript</nobr> 1, March 26, 1869„ “Diligence in
          the Work of Preparation.”</p>
