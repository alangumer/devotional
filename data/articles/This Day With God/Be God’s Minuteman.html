    <h1>Be God’s Minuteman</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Don’t let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould, but let God <nobr>re-make</nobr> you so
          that your whole attitude of mind is changed. Romans 12:2, Phillips.</strong></p>
      <p>We must free ourselves from the customs and bondage of society, that, when the principles of our faith are at
          stake, we shall not hesitate to show our colors, even if we are called singular for so doing. Keep the
          conscience tender, that you may hear the faintest whisper of the voice that spake as never man spake. Let all
          who would wear the yoke of Christ show an inﬂexible purpose to do right because it is right. Keep the eye ﬁxed
          on Jesus, inquiring at every step, “Is this the way of the Lord?” The Lord will not leave anyone who does this
          to become the sport of Satan’s temptation.</p>
      <p>When perplexities arise, as they are sure to do, draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. And then, when
          the enemy comes in like a ﬂood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard for you. Decide that there is a
          great work to be done, and that no man’s inﬂuence or opposition shall divert you from the plain path of duty.
          Then you can say with Nehemiah, “The hand of my God is good upon me” (see Nehemiah 2:18).</p>
      <p>When men connected with the work of God allow themselves to be bought and sold, when they violate truth to gain
          the favor and approval of men, God records them in His book as betrayers of sacred trust. Let every man stand
          in moral independence, resolved that his mind shall be molded by the Holy Spirit. God calls for minutemen, who
          are not ready to voice the words of men who, if converted could exert a good inﬂuence, but unconverted, are
          not to be depended upon. In an emergency they are sure to lead into false paths. The Lord would not have us
          imitate any man, but follow on step by step to know Him....</p>
      <p>We are not to fashion ourselves by the world’s criterion or after the world’s type. God’s people will hear
          conversations regarding the carrying out of wrong methods and plans. Words of irreverence will be spoken.
          Religion will be jested about. Hear the voice of God, “My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not”
          (Proverbs 1:10). Those who are controlled by the Spirit of God need to keep their perceptive faculties
          awake.... Have courage to do the right. The</p>
      <p>Lord’s promise is more valuable than gold and silver to all who are doers of His word. Let all regard it as a
          great honor to be acknowledged by God as His <nobr>children.—Manuscript</nobr> 121, October 2, 1898„ “An
          Example of Faithfulness.”</p>
