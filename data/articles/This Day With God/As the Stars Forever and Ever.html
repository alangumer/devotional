    <h1>As the Stars Forever and Ever</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to
          righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. Daniel 12:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Upon us there rests the solemn responsibility of presenting the truth to unbelievers in the most forcible
          manner. How careful we should be not to present the truth in a way that will drive men and women from it.
          Religious teachers stand where they can do great good or great evil. If every one will now awake to the
          responsibility resting on him, and be determined not to place himself on the judgment seat, to criticize and
          condemn others, but to go to work, to preach the gospel as never before to those in darkness, many souls will
          be turned from iniquity to righteousness.</p>
      <p>Faithful stewards are needed. God will work with everyone who will be worked. The Holy Spirit will lead many
          souls to Christ. In His companionship they will be ﬁtted for the courts above. Those who are laborers together
          with God will become wise in soul saving. They will learn of the great Teacher, and while they are presenting
          Bible subjects to those they are trying to help, the grace of Christ will ﬁll their hearts, and the Word of
          God will unfold before them. While they are sounding the call, “Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever
          will, let him take the water of life freely” (Revelation 22:17), their own thirst will be quenched.</p>
      <p>All need now to be faithful with God, gathering up the fragments, that nothing be lost. He calls for diligent,
          faithful service. There must be no lack of economy; every penny should be carefully treasured. We are to
          remember the lesson that Christ gave to His disciples after He had fed the multitude with ﬁve loaves and two
          ﬁshes. Everyone had been satisﬁed, and then Christ said to the disciples, “Gather up the fragments that
          remain, that nothing be lost” (John 6:12).</p>
      <p>We are to receive truth from Christ, and impart it to the people. Inﬁdelity and all kinds of wickedness are
          rapidly increasing, and the zeal and earnestness of God’s servants are to increase proportionately.... If we
          withhold from God</p>
      <p>our service of love, we leave sinners <nobr>unwarned.—Letter</nobr> 177, August 8, 1903„ to Edson White.</p>
