    <h1>Perfect in Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:48.</strong></p>
      <p>God requires moral perfection in all. Those who have been given light and opportunities should, as God’s
          stewards, aim for perfection, and never, never lower the standard of righteousness to accommodate inherited
          and cultivated tendencies to wrong. Christ took upon Him our human nature, and lived our life, to show us that
          we may be like Him by partaking of the divine nature. We may be holy, as Christ was holy in human nature. Why
          then are there so many disagreeable characters in the world? It is because they do not suspect that their
          disagreeable ways and rough, impolite speech is the result of an unholy heart....</p>
      <p>It is the fragrance of our love to our fellow men that reveals our love for God. It is patience in service that
          brings rest to the soul. It is through humble, diligent, faithful toilers that the welfare of Israel is
          promoted. God upholds and strengthens the one who is willing to learn Christ’s way....</p>
      <p>All right inventions and improvements have their source in Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
          working. Whatever we do, in whatever department of the work we are placed, God desires to reﬁne and ennoble
          us. He desires to control man’s mind, that he may do perfect work.</p>
      <p>The delicate touch of the physician’s hand, his power over nerve and muscle, his knowledge of the delicate
          organism of the body, is the wisdom of divine power, to be used in behalf of suffering humanity. The skill
          with which the carpenter uses the hammer, the strength with which the blacksmith makes the anvil ring, comes
          from God. He has entrusted men with powers, and He expects that they will look to Him for counsel. Thus they
          may use His gifts with unerring aptitude, testifying to God’s glory that they are workers together with Him.
          Thus they purify their souls by sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit through the truth. In their experience, the words
          of Christ are fulﬁlled, The pure in heart shall see God (see Matthew 5:8).</p>
      <p>All should feel that they are working to one great end. The work in every department is God’s, and those who do
          that work with exactness, without blunder, represent God’s <nobr>perfection.—Letter</nobr> 9, January 24,
          1899„ to those occupying important positions in the General Conference.</p>
