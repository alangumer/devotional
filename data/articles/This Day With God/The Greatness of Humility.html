    <h1>The Greatness of Humility</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same
          shall save it. Luke 9:24.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ gave His disciples a most important lesson in regard to who should be His disciples. “In the kingdom
          that I am about to set up,” He said, “strife for the supremacy shall have no place. All ye are brethren. All
          My servants there shall be equal. The only greatness recognized there will be the greatness of humility and
          devotion to the service of others. He that humbleth himself shall be exalted, and he that exalteth himself
          shall be abased. He who seeks to serve others by <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> will
          be given the attributes of character that commend themselves to God, and develop wisdom, true patience,
          forbearance, kindness, compassion. This gives him the chiefest place in the kingdom of God.”</p>
      <p>The Son of man humbled Himself to become the servant of God. He submitted to abasement and
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> even to death, to give freedom and life, and a place in His kingdom to those who
          believe on Him. He gave His life as a ransom for many. This should be enough to make those who are continually
          seeking to be ﬁrst and striving for the supremacy, ashamed of their course.</p>
      <p>“If any man will come after me,” Christ said, “let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow
          me” (Luke 9:23). This is the proof of discipleship. If church members would be doers of the Word, as they
          solemnly pledged themselves to be when they received baptism, they would love their brethren, and would be
          constantly seeking for unity and harmony....</p>
      <p>Those who believe in Christ and walk humbly with Him, ...who watch to see what they can do to help and bless
          and strengthen the souls of others, cooperate with the angels who minister to those who shall be heirs of
          salvation. Jesus gives them grace, and wisdom, and righteousness, making them a blessing to all with whom they
          are brought in contact. The more humble they are in their own estimation, the more blessings they receive from
          God, because receiving does not exalt them. They make a right use of their blessings, for they receive to
          impart.</p>
      <p>The ministering angels receive instruction from the throne of God to cooperate with human instrumentalities.
          They receive the grace of Christ, to give it to human <nobr>beings.—Manuscript</nobr> 165, December 13, 1898„
          “Unity a Test of Discipleship.”</p>
