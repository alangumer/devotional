    <h1>Even a Child Is Known</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. Proverbs
          20:11.</strong></p>
      <p>When Christ was yet a child, He was found by Joseph and His mother in the temple among the doctors, listening
          to them and asking them questions. By His questions He threw great light into their minds. On this visit to
          Jerusalem He had a realization that He was indeed the Son of God, and that a special work lay before Him.</p>
      <p>When His mother said to Him, “Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee
          sorrowing,” He answered, “How is it that ye sought me?” Then with the light of divinity shining forth from His
          countenance, He said in a most solemn manner, “Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?” (Luke
          2:48, 49). And although after this He returned to Nazareth, and was subject to His parents, yet He did not
          lose the realization of His future <nobr>work—the</nobr> knowledge that He must labor to save the lost. He
          knew that He must keep faithful watch over every faculty, that Satan might not obtain one jot of
          advantage.</p>
      <p>In all His actions He must be the Son of God, that He might dwell among men as the representative of the
          Father. His work was to make others the sons of God, and He must lose no opportunity for casting the leaven
          into the meal, that other youth, and those of mature age might see that it is not safe to neglect to become
          intellectually qualiﬁed to be coworkers with God. He must teach His fellow men to labor to the full extent of
          their ability to become what they would one day wish they had made themselves.</p>
      <p>Christ was misunderstood by His brothers; for He was not like them. He worked to relieve every case of
          suffering that He saw, and He was always successful. He had little money to give, but He often gave His own
          humble food to those whom He thought more needy than Himself. His brothers felt that His inﬂuence went far to
          counteract theirs; for when they spoke harshly to poor, degraded souls with whom they came in contact, Christ
          sought these very ones, and spoke words of encouragement to them. If when in the family circle, He could do no
          more, He would as quietly and secretly as possible, give the wretched beings He was trying to help, the cup of
          cold water, and then place His own meal in their <nobr>hands.—Manuscript</nobr> 22, February 20, 1898„
          “Christ, the Great Missionary.”</p>
