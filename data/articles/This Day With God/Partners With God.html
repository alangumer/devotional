    <h1>Partners With God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the
          increase. 1 Corinthians 3:7.</strong></p>
      <p>We need to understand that individually we are in copartnership with God. “Work out your own salvation with
          fear and trembling,” He admonishes us, and adds, “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
          his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:12, 13). Here is the cooperation of the divine with human agencies....</p>
      <p>The former and the latter rains are needed. “We are labourers together with God” (1 Corinthians 3:9). The Lord
          alone can give the precious former and latter rain. The clouds, the sunshine, the dews at
          <nobr>night—these</nobr> are heaven’s most precious provisions. But all these favors graciously bestowed of
          Heaven will prove of little worth to those who do not appropriate them by diligent, painstaking effort on
          their part. Personal efforts must be put forth in agriculture. There is the plowing and replowing. Implements
          must be brought in and human skill must use them. The seed must be sown in its season. The laws which control
          seedtime and harvest must be observed, else there will be no harvest....</p>
      <p>The apostle brings in another ﬁgure: “Ye are God’s building” (Verse <nobr>9)—an</nobr> ediﬁce to be erected.
          The construction of a building calls for skill in using the timber which God has caused to grow for the
          happiness and blessing of man. The Lord has provided the forest trees, and now man must use the trees. They
          must be cut down and prepared by saw, and axe, and wedge, and hammer, to be ﬁtted for the building....</p>
      <p>Thus is presented the copartnership of the human and the divine. All the power is of God. “Without me,” says
          Christ, “ye can do nothing” (John 15:5). Then how many hours is it safe for us to try to work alone? All the
          glory proceeds from God and should ﬂow back in all possible ways to God, through our cooperation with
          God....</p>
      <p>We need to consider carefully our own spiritual interest. If we are abiding in Christ, we shall not allow
          ambitious business transactions, even in our service for Him, to come before the spiritual fragrance that
          should characterize our association with our <nobr>brethren.—Manuscript</nobr> 182, September 24, 1897„ “Ye
          Are God’s Husbandry.”</p>
