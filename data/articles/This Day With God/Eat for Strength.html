    <h1>Eat for Strength</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for
          strength, and not for drunkenness! Ecclesiastes 10:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The laws of health are to be obeyed. It is important that the digestive organs shall not be overtaxed. There
          are many who keep the stomach continually at work. It has not opportunity to recruit its strength, and the
          result must be digestive disorders.</p>
      <p>There should be no eating between meals, and at least ﬁve hours should be allowed to elapse between the meals.
          Indigestion is the result of food taken into the stomach before the digestive organs have had time to dispose
          of the foregoing meal....</p>
      <p>Three meals are sufﬁcient, and two meals are better than three. For the past thirty years I have eaten only two
          meals a day. The dullness from which people suffer is often caused by overeating, and by eating at irregular
          periods. Dyspepsia brings despondency, and one suffering from this disease, though he may profess to be a
          Christian, acts in an <nobr>un-Christlike</nobr> manner.</p>
      <p>Some claim that the inclination to eat is sufﬁcient guide. But one may get into the habit of eating several
          times a day, yet this would not be best. Such a habit would produce disease, because the digestive organs
          would be overtaxed.</p>
      <p>Practice health reform, and refuse to be turned aside from the right path. Do not faint away, but make your
          will power bring your appetite into subjection to a true purpose....</p>
      <p>God gave Adam charge of the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it, and of the trees and herbs bearing
          seed, He said, “They shall be for meat” (see Genesis 1:29; 3:18). Afterward the eating of ﬂesh meat was
          permitted as one of the consequences of the fall. Before the ﬂood, no provision was made for the use of animal
          food....</p>
      <p>Try going without ﬂesh meat for six months, and see if a change for the better does not take place. I ask you
          to do this at once. Let your imagination be sanctiﬁed. Let your mind and conscience be awakened, your whole
          being aroused. Guard yourself against giving yourself too much sympathy. Be heroic. Be determined to overcome
          perverted <nobr>appetite.—Letter</nobr> 208, July 20, 1905„ to a physician and his wife.</p>
