    <h1>Controlled by the Great Designer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and
          then shall the end come. Matthew 24:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The church is to work actively as an organized body to spread abroad the inﬂuence of the cross of Christ. Those
          who work unselﬁshly to give the truth to those nigh and afar off are registered in the courts above, “Laborers
          together with God; ...God’s husbandry, ...God’s building.” Controlled by the great Designer, they show what
          human beings can be when they wear the yoke of Christ, learning His meekness and lowliness.</p>
      <p>It is because so many of Christ’s professed followers seek to be ﬁrst that He cannot trust them. Were they
          humble, willing to be taught by Him, they would be a power in showing to the world the inﬂuence of the truth
          upon human character. Those who work in Christ’s lines, never seeking to exalt self, will reveal constant
          activity and steady progress in missionary enterprises. They will not be satisﬁed unless church is added to
          church.</p>
      <p>God expects those in His service to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. Our
          aggressive missionary work is to be more abundant than it has been in the past. More territory is to be
          annexed; the standard of truth is to be planted in new places; churches are to be established; all is to be
          done that can be done to fulﬁll the commission, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations” (Matthew
          28:19)....</p>
      <p>The life of a church depends on the interest which its members manifest in those outside the fold. Let the
          church of God remember that Christ gave Himself as a sacriﬁce to save a world from destruction. For our sake
          He became poor, that we through His poverty might come into possession of eternal riches. Shall those whom God
          has blessed with a knowledge of the truth become narrow in their plans. Let them arouse to a sense of their
          vast obligations, cutting away every thread of selﬁshness, that the Lord may pour upon them His Holy
          Spirit.</p>
      <p>Let them seek the Lord while He may be found, and call upon Him while He is near. They have no reason for being
          faithless and complaining. Let them cease all <nobr>fault-ﬁnding</nobr> and murmuring, and encourage a spirit
          of gratitude for past mercies and blessings. Let them praise the Lord in unfeigned gratitude for the light of
          His <nobr>Word.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 21, 1901.</p>
