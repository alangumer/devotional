    <h1>How to Have Heaven Here</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Desire a better country, that is, an heavenly. Hebrews 11:16.</strong></p>
      <p>We want to seek with all the powers that God has given us to unfold the Scriptures to those who are in
          darkness. There is happiness, hope, and peace for the desponding. We cannot afford to give our
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> ability and devote it to the commonplace things of this earth. We want a faith that
          will grasp the promise set before us in the gospel. What if we should lose our soul? It would be better for us
          had we never been born. One soul is worth more than all the gold and silver that could be heaped up on this
          earth....</p>
      <p>We want to cultivate living faith in God. We want to have our eyes turned away from the attractions of this
          earth and centered upon heaven and heavenly things. We do not want the earth to intervene between us and God,
          but we want an eye single to the glory of God. We talk of heaven and of its blessing, and it would be a great
          loss to lose it. Well then, if it so lovely, so desirable, bring it into this life, bring it into your
          families and educate your children not to live for this world but for the future, immortal life....</p>
      <p>You can have a little heaven here below, if you will only get your eye ﬁxed upon <nobr>God—not</nobr> looking
          at Christ half the time and at the world the other half. When you live for God, He will put His everlasting
          arm beneath you, and then He says, “My yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew 11:30). Do you believe
          it? I can testify this is so. By my past experience I can testify that I would not [want to] have one trial
          less, one sorrow less, for Paul says, “Our light afﬂiction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
          more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
          which are not seen” (2 Corinthians 4:17, 18). We want to look at the things of eternal interest, that we may
          think seriously in regard to what use we have made of our reasoning powers, whether we have tried to
          strengthen them with idle things which we cannot take with us when we shall be caught up to meet Christ in the
          air....</p>
      <p>We want to be ﬁtting that we may have an abundant entrance into the city of God.... Everything compared with
          this is of no <nobr>consequence.—Manuscript</nobr> 16,</p>
      <p>September 19, 1886„ “The Privilege of Being a Christian.”</p>
