    <h1>Let Your Light Shine</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto
          me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts
          1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>My heart was rejoiced to see among the converts [at Willis, Michigan] so many young men and women, with hearts
          softened and subdued by the love of Jesus, acknowledging the good work wrought by God for their souls. It was
          indeed a precious season. “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is
          made unto salvation” (Romans 10:10)....</p>
      <p>It is essential that these who have newly come to the faith should have a sense of their obligation to God, who
          has called them to a knowledge of the truth, and ﬁlled their hearts with His sacred peace, that they may exert
          a sanctifying inﬂuence over all with whom they associate. “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord” (Isaiah
          43:10). To every one God has committed a work, to make known His salvation to the world.</p>
      <p>In true religion there is nothing selﬁsh or exclusive. The gospel of Christ is diffusive and aggressive. It is
          described as the salt of the earth, the transforming leaven, the light which shineth in darkness. It is
          impossible for one to retain the favor and love of God, and enjoy communion with Him, and still feel no
          responsibility for the souls for whom Christ died, who are in error and darkness, perishing in their sins. If
          those who profess to be followers of Christ neglect to shine as lights in the world, the vital power will
          leave them, and they will become cold and Christless. The spell of indifference will be upon them, a deathlike
          sluggishness of soul, which will make them bodies of death instead of living representatives of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Every one must lift the cross, and in modesty, meekness, and lowliness of mind, take up his
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> duties, engaging in personal effort for those around him who need help and light. All
          who accept these duties will have a rich and varied experience, their own hearts will glow with fervor, and
          they will be strengthened and stimulated to renewed, persevering efforts to work out their own salvation with
          fear and trembling, because it is God that worketh in them both to will and to do of His good
          <nobr>pleasure.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 21, 1891.</p>
