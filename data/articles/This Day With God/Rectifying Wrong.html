    <h1>Rectifying Wrong</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
          alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Matthew 18:15.</strong></p>
      <p>As you go to the one you suppose to be in fault, see that you speak in a meek and lowly spirit, for the wrath
          of man worketh not the righteousness of God. The erring can in no other way be restored than in the spirit of
          meekness and gentleness and tender love. Be careful in your manner of speaking. Avoid everything in look or
          gesture, word or tone of voice, that savors of pride or <nobr>self-sufﬁciency.</nobr> Guard yourself against
          word or look that would exalt yourself or set your goodness and righteousness in contrast to their failings.
          Beware of the most distant approach to disdain, overbearing, or contempt. With care, avoid every appearance of
          anger, and though you use plainness of speech, yet let there be no reproach, no railing accusation, no token
          of warmth, but that of earnest love.</p>
      <p>Above all, let there be no shadow of hate or ill will, no bitterness or soreness of expression. Nothing but
          kindness and gentleness can ﬂow from a heart of love. Yet all these precious fruits need not hinder your
          speaking in the most serious, solemn manner, as though angels were directing their eyes upon you, and you
          acting in reference to the coming judgment.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that the success of reproof depends greatly upon the spirit in which it was given. Do not neglect
          earnest prayer that you may possess a lowly mind, and that angels of God may work upon the hearts before you,
          which you are trying to reach, and so soften them by heavenly impressions that your efforts may avail. If any
          good is accomplished take no credit yourself. God alone should be exalted. God alone hath done it all....</p>
      <p>All your efforts to save the erring may be unavailing. They may repay you evil for good. They may be enraged
          rather than convinced. What if they hear to no good purpose and pursue the evil course they have started to
          follow? This will frequently be the case. Sometimes the mildest and tenderest reproof will have no good
          effect. In that case the blessing you wanted another to receive by pursuing a course of righteousness, ceasing
          to do evil and learning to do well, will return into your own bosom. If the erring persist in sin, treat them
          kindly and leave them with your heavenly <nobr>Father.—Letter</nobr> 30, April 6, 1868„ to Brother and Sister
          Rogers.</p>
