    <h1>Reward for Faithfulness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and
          drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. Luke 21:34.</strong></p>
      <p>Dear Christian friend, stop and think. You are trading with your Lord’s money; and what use are you making of
          it? You may suffer your mind to be engrossed with business transactions and the cares of this life; but you
          cannot carry these things with you into the other world. There will be no use for this kind of education
          there. Then why not use your talents to build up Christ’s kingdom? Why not give to the service of God the
          tact, skill, and energy that have made you successful in business? The works of this world will be destroyed.
          Would it not be better to put some of your thinking powers into the cause of God, and build where the work
          will be enduring, and you will not suffer loss?</p>
      <p>The constant burden of your hearts should be, What can I do to save souls for whom Christ died? All around me
          are precious souls lying in wickedness, that must perish unless someone shall work for their salvation. How
          can I best reach these wandering ones, that I may bring them to the glorious city of God, and present them
          before the throne, saying, Here am I and the children whom the Lord hath given me?</p>
      <p>Some may excuse themselves by saying, I have had no experience in this kind of work; I have used my ability
          only in the things of this life. Well, it is for you to say whether you will continue to devote your time and
          strength to worldly interests, or will use them in the cause of God. None of us will be forced into this
          service. If we choose to concentrate our powers upon worldly matters, there will be nothing to hinder us. But
          why is it that we persist in laying up treasure here instead of above? Suppose you should change the order of
          things, and lay up some of your treasure in heaven, would you not rejoice to receive it again by and by,
          imperishable? ...</p>
      <p>Christ has appointed to every man his work. The second death will be the portion of those who labor not, and
          the dreadful words will be heard, “Depart from me, ye that work iniquity” (Matthew 7:23). But the faithful
          servants will not lose their reward. They will gain eternal life, and the “Well done, good and faithful
          servant” (Chap. 25:23), will fall as sweetest music on their <nobr>ears.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, July
          28, 1887.</p>
