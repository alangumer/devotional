      <p><strong>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether
          it be evil. Ecclesiastes 12:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord is soon to come in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. Is there not enough comprehended
          in the truths which cluster round this event and in the preparation essential for it, to make us think
          solemnly of our duty? Distinctly and clearly this subject is to be kept before the people. “The Son of man
          shall come in his glory ...: and before him shall be gathered all nations” (Matthew 25:31, 32).</p>
      <p>Present the truth that is needed in every church as the means to an end, and that end the judgment, with its
          eternal decisions and rewards. God will render to every man according to his work. “Enoch also, the seventh
          from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute
          judgment upon all” (Jude 1:14, 15). And Solomon, when making his appeal and declaration as a preacher of
          righteousness, presented the prospect of a judgment to come. “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter,”
          he said: “Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every
          work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil” (Ecclesiastes 12:13,
          14).</p>
      <p>We have an abundance of weighty, solemn truths to proclaim from the Word of God without allowing the mind to
          devise and plan theories of human nothingness to present to the ﬂock of God as testing truth. What is the
          chaff to the wheat?</p>
      <p>The ﬁnal judgment is a most solemn, awful event. This must take place before the universe. To the Lord Jesus
          the Father has committed all judgment. He will declare the reward of loyalty to the law of Jehovah. God will
          be honored and His government vindicated and gloriﬁed, and that in the presence of the inhabitants of the
          unfallen worlds. On the largest possible scale will the government of God be vindicated and exalted. It is not
          the judgment of one individual or of one nation, but of the whole world. Oh, what a change will then be made
          in the understanding of all created beings. Then all will see the value of eternal <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr>
          131, October 14, 1900„ to Elder A. G. Daniells.</p>
