    <h1>Jesus, the Chief Cornerstone of the Church</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be
          confounded. 1 Peter 2:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Upon the foundation that Christ Himself had laid, the apostles built the church of God. In the Scriptures the
          ﬁgure of the erection of a temple is frequently used to illustrate the building of the church. Zechariah
          refers to Christ as the Branch that should build the temple of the Lord....</p>
      <p>In the quarry of the Jewish and the Gentile world the apostles labored, bringing out stones to lay upon the
          foundation. In his letter to the believers at Ephesus, Paul said, “Now therefore ye are no more strangers and
          foreigners, but <nobr>fellow-citizens</nobr> with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon
          the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all
          the building ﬁtly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded
          together for an habitation of God through the Spirit” (Ephesians <nobr>2:19-22)....</nobr></p>
      <p>The apostles built upon a sure foundation, even the Rock of Ages. To this foundation they brought the stones
          that they quarried from the world. Not without hindrance did the builders labor. Their work was made
          exceedingly difﬁcult by the opposition of the enemies of Christ. They had to contend against the bigotry,
          prejudice, and hatred of those who were building upon a false foundation. Many who wrought as builders of the
          church could be likened to the builders of the wall in Nehemiah’s day, of whom it is written: “They which
          builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands
          wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon” (Nehemiah 4:17).</p>
      <p>Kings and governors, priests and rulers, sought to destroy the temple of God. But in the face of imprisonment,
          torture, and death, faithful men carried the work forward; and the structure grew, beautiful and symmetrical.
          At times the workmen were almost blinded by the mists of superstition that settled around them. At times they
          were almost overpowered by the violence of their opponents. But with unfaltering faith and unfailing courage
          they pressed on with the work.</p>
      <p>One after another the foremost of the builders fell by the hand of the enemy. Stephen was stoned; James was
          slain by the sword; Paul was beheaded; Peter was cruciﬁed; John was exiled. Yet the church grew. New workers
          took the place of those who fell, and stone after stone was added to the building. Thus slowly ascended the
          temple of the church of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>595-597.</nobr></p>
