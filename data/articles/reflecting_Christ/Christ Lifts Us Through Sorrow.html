    <h1>Christ Lifts Us Through Sorrow</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Happy is the man whom God correcteth.... He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he</strong></p>
      <p>wounded, and his hands make whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil
          touch thee. Job <nobr>5:17-19.</nobr></p>
      <p>When tribulation comes upon us, how many of us are like Jacob! We think it the hand of an enemy; and in the
          darkness we wrestle blindly until our strength is spent, and we ﬁnd no comfort or deliverance. To Jacob the
          divine touch at break of day revealed the One with whom he had been <nobr>contending—the</nobr> Angel of the
          covenant; and, weeping and helpless, he fell upon the breast of Inﬁnite Love, to receive the blessing for
          which his soul longed. We also need to learn that trials mean beneﬁt, and not to despise the chastening of the
          Lord nor faint when we are rebuked of Him....</p>
      <p>God would not have us remain pressed down by dumb sorrow, with sore and breaking hearts. He would have us look
          up and behold His dear face of love. The blessed Saviour stands by many whose eyes are so blinded by tears
          that they do not discern Him. He longs to clasp our hands, to have us look to Him in simple faith, permitting
          Him to guide us. His heart is open to our griefs, our sorrows, and our trials. He has loved us with an
          everlasting love and with <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> compassed us about. We may keep the heart stayed upon
          Him and meditate upon His <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> all the day. He will lift the soul above the daily
          sorrow and perplexity, into a realm of peace.</p>
      <p>Think of this, children of suffering and sorrow, and rejoice in hope. “This is the victory that overcometh the
          world, even our faith” (1 John 5:4).</p>
      <p>Blessed are they also who weep with Jesus in sympathy with the world’s sorrow and in sorrow for its sin. In
          such mourning there is intermingled no thought of self. Jesus was the Man of Sorrows, enduring heart anguish
          such as no language can portray. His spirit was torn and bruised by the transgressions of men. He toiled with
          <nobr>self-consuming</nobr> zeal to relieve the wants and woes of humanity, and His heart was heavy with
          sorrow as He saw multitudes refuse to come to Him that they might have life.</p>
      <p>All who are followers of Christ will share in this experience. As they partake of His love they will enter into
          His travail for the saving of the lost. They share in the sufferings of Christ, and they will share also in
          the glory that shall be revealed. One with Him in His work, drinking with Him the cup of sorrow, they are
          partakers also of His joy.... The Lord</p>
      <p>has special grace for the mourner, and its power is to melt hearts, to win <nobr>souls.—Thoughts</nobr> from
          the Mount of Blessing, <nobr>11-13.</nobr></p>
