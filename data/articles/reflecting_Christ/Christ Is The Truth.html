    <h1>Christ Is The Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
          John 14:6.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is the truth. His words are truth, and they have a deeper signiﬁcance than appears on the surface. All
          the sayings of Christ have a value beyond their unpretending appearance. Minds that are quickened by the Holy
          Spirit will discern the value of these sayings. They will discern the precious gems of truth, though these may
          be buried treasures.</p>
      <p>Human theories and speculations will never lead to an understanding of God’s Word. Those who suppose that they
          understand philosophy think that their explanations are necessary to unlock the treasures of knowledge and to
          prevent heresies from coming into the church. But it is these explanations that have brought in false theories
          and heresies. Men have made desperate efforts to explain what they thought to be intricate scriptures; but too
          often their efforts have only darkened that which they tried to make clear.</p>
      <p>The priests and Pharisees thought they were doing great things as teachers, by putting their own interpretation
          upon the Word of God; but Christ said of them, “Ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God” (Mark
          12:24). He charged them with the guilt of “teaching for doctrines the commandments of men” (chap. 7:7). Though
          they were the teachers of the oracles of God, though they were supposed to understand His Word, they were not
          doers of the Word. Satan had blinded their eyes that they should not see its true import.</p>
      <p>This is the work of many in our day. Many churches are guilty of this sin. There is danger, great danger, that
          the supposed wise men of today will repeat the experience of the Jewish teachers. They falsely interpret the
          divine oracles, and souls are brought into perplexity and shrouded in darkness because of their misconception
          of divine truth.</p>
      <p>The Scriptures need not be read by the dim light of tradition or human speculation. As well might we try to
          give light to the sun with a torch as to explain the Scriptures by human tradition or imagination. God’s Holy
          Word needs not the torchlight glimmer of earth to make its glories distinguishable. It is light in
          <nobr>itself—the</nobr> glory of God revealed, and beside it every other light is <nobr>dim.—Christ’s</nobr>
          Object Lessons, 110, 111.</p>
      <p>It is the truth ... we all need, the truth that works by love and puriﬁes the <nobr>soul.—The</nobr> Upward
          Look, 293.</p>
