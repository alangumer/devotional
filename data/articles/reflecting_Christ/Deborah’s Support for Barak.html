    <h1>Deborah’s Support for Barak</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Village life ... ceased until I, Deborah, arose ... as a mother in Israel. When they chose new gods,
          war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. Judges 5:7, 8,
          N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>For twenty years, the Israelites groaned under the yoke of the oppressor; then they turned from their idolatry,
          and with humiliation and repentance cried unto the Lord for deliverance. They did not cry in vain. There was
          dwelling in Israel a woman illustrious for her piety, and through her the Lord chose to deliver His people.
          Her name was Deborah. She was known as a prophetess, and in the absence of the usual magistrates, the people
          had sought to her for counsel and justice.</p>
      <p>The Lord communicated to Deborah His purpose to destroy the enemies of Israel, and bade her send for a man
          named Barak.... and make known to him the instructions which she</p>
      <p>had received. She accordingly sent for Barak, and directed him to assemble ten thousand men of the tribes of
          Naphtali and Zebulun, and make war upon the armies of King Jabin.</p>
      <p>Barak knew the scattered, disheartened, and unarmed condition of the Hebrews, and the strength and skill of
          their enemies. Although he had been designated by the Lord Himself as the one chosen to deliver Israel, and
          had received the assurance that God would go with him and subdue their enemies, yet he was timid and
          distrustful. He accepted the message from Deborah as the word of God, but he had little conﬁdence in Israel,
          and feared that they would not obey his call. He refused to engage in such a doubtful undertaking unless
          Deborah would accompany him, and thus support his efforts by her inﬂuence and counsel....</p>
      <p>Barak now marshaled an army of ten thousand men, and marched to Mount Tabor, as the Lord had directed. Sisera
          immediately assembled an immense and <nobr>well-equipped</nobr> force, expecting to surround the Hebrews and
          make them an easy prey. The Israelites ... looked with terror upon the vast armies spread out in the plain
          beneath them equipped with all the implements of warfare.... Large, scythelike knives were fastened to the
          axles, so that the</p>
      <p>chariots, being driven through ranks of the enemy, would cut them down like wheat before the sickle.</p>
      <p>The Israelites had established themselves in a strong position in the mountains to await a favorable
          opportunity for an attack. Encouraged by Deborah’s assurance that the very day had come for signal victory,
          Barak led his army down into the open plain, and boldly made a charge upon the enemy. The God of battle fought
          for Israel and neither skill in warfare, nor superiority of numbers and equipment, could withstand them. The
          hosts of Sisera were <nobr>panic-stricken....</nobr> God alone could have discomﬁted the enemy, and the
          victory could be</p>
      <p>ascribed to Him <nobr>alone.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 16, 1881.</p>
