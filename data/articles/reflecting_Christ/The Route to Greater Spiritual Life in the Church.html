      <p><strong>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. John 3:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The question is often asked, Why is there not more power in the church? why not more vital godliness? The
          reason is, the requirements of God’s Word are not complied with in verity and in truth; God is not loved
          supremely, and our neighbor as ourselves. This covers the entire ground. Upon these two commandments hang all
          the law and the prophets. Let these two requirements of God be obeyed explicitly, and there would be no
          discord in the church, no inharmonious notes in the family. With many the work is too superﬁcial. Outward
          forms take the place of the inner work of grace.... The theory of the truth has</p>
      <p>converted the head, but the soul temple has not been cleansed from its idols....</p>
      <p>True conviction of sin, real heart sorrow because of wickedness, death to self, the daily overcoming of defects
          of character, and the new <nobr>birth—these,</nobr> represented as old things, Paul says had passed away, and
          all things had become new. Such a work many know nothing of. They grafted the truth into their natural hearts,
          and then went on as before, manifesting the same unhappy traits of character. What is now needed is the plain
          testimony borne in love from lips touched with living ﬁre.</p>
      <p>Church members do not show that living connection with God that they must have in order to win souls from
          darkness to light. Make the tree good, and good fruit will be the result. The work of the Spirit of God upon
          the heart is essential to godliness. It must be received into the hearts of those who accept the truth, and
          create in them clean hearts, before one of them can keep His commandments and be doers of the Word. “Marvel
          not,” said the great Teacher unto the astonished Nicodemus, “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born
          again.”</p>
      <p>The Bible is not studied as much as it should be; it is not made the rule of life. Were its precepts
          conscientiously followed, and made the basis of character, there would be steadfastness of purpose that no
          business speculations or worldly pursuits could seriously inﬂuence. A character thus formed, and supported by
          the Word of God, will abide the day of trial, of difﬁculties, and dangers. The conscience must be enlightened,
          and the life sanctiﬁed by the love of the truth received into the heart, before the inﬂuence will be saving
          upon the world.</p>
      <p>What is needed is men of action for the time, prompt, determined, ﬁrm as a rock to principle, and prepared to
          meet any emergency. Why we are so weak, why there are so many irresponsible men among us, is because they do
          not connect with God; they have not an indwelling Saviour, and do not feel the love of Christ ever fresh and
          new.... No earthly</p>
      <p>relationship is as strong as this love. Nothing can compare with <nobr>it.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August
          28, 1879.</p>
