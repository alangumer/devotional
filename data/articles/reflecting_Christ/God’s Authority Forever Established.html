    <h1>God’s Authority Forever Established</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
          God, and him only shalt thou serve. Matthew 4:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan sought to make it appear that he was working for the liberty of the universe. He was determined to make
          his arguments so varied, so deceptive, so insidious, that everyone would be convinced that God’s law was
          tyrannical. Even while hanging on the cross, assailed by Satan with his ﬁercest temptations, Christ was
          victorious.... With His parting</p>
      <p>breath He exclaimed, “It is ﬁnished.” The battle had been won.... The blood of the innocent</p>
      <p>had been shed for the guilty. By the life that He gave, man was ransomed from eternal death, and the doom of
          him who had the power of death was sealed.</p>
      <p>Not until the death of Christ was the character of Satan clearly revealed to the angels or to the unfallen
          worlds. Then the prevarications and accusations of him who had once been an exalted angel were seen in their
          true light. It was seen that his professedly spotless character was deceptive. His deeply laid scheme to exalt
          himself to supremacy was fully discerned. His falsehoods were apparent to all. God’s authority was forever
          established. Truth triumphed over falsehood.</p>
      <p>Not merely in the minds of a few ﬁnite creatures in this world, but in the minds of all the inhabitants of the
          heavenly universe, has the immutability of God’s law been established. Satan’s course against Christ was
          heralded to every world. When the issue was ﬁnally determined, every unfallen being expressed indignation at
          the rebellion. With one voice they extolled God as righteous, merciful, <nobr>self-denying,</nobr>
          just....</p>
      <p>The heavenly universe had witnessed the weapons that were chosen by the Prince of <nobr>life—the</nobr> words
          of Scripture, “It is written”; and the weapons used by the prince of the <nobr>world—falsehood</nobr> and
          deception. They had seen the Prince of life deal in straightforward lines of truth, honesty, and integrity,
          while the prince of the world exercised his power of cunning, artful secrecy, intrigue, enmity, and revenge.
          They had seen the One who bore the banner of truth sacriﬁce everything, even His life, to maintain truth,
          while the one who bore the banner of rebellion continued to strengthen his accusations against the God of
          truth.</p>
      <p>The heavenly worlds and heaven itself were amazed at God’s long forbearance.... The</p>
      <p>Lord had demonstrated His wisdom and justice in banishing Satan from heaven.... All the</p>
      <p>unfallen beings are now united in regarding God’s law as changeless.... His law has been</p>
      <p>proved faultless. His government is forever <nobr>secure.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 27, 1902.</p>
