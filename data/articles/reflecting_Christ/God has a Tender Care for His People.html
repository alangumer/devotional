    <h1>God has a Tender Care for His People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. Psalm
          34:15.</strong></p>
      <p>You must not sink down discouraged. The fainthearted will be made strong; the desponding will be made to hope.
          God has a tender care for His people. His ear is open unto their cry. I have no fears for God’s cause. He will
          take care of His own cause. Our duty is to ﬁll our lot and place, live...humble at the foot of the cross, and
          live faithful, holy lives before Him. While we do this we shall not be ashamed, but our souls will conﬁde in
          God with holy boldness.</p>
      <p>God has released us from burdens; He has set us free.... Our enemies may triumph. They</p>
      <p>may speak lying words, and their slandering tongue frame slander, deceit, guile; yet will we not be moved. We
          know in whom we believe. We have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. Jesus knows us.... A reckoning day
          is coming and all will be judged according to the</p>
      <p>deeds that are done in the body....</p>
      <p>It is true the world is dark. Opposition may wax strong. The triﬂer and scorner may grow bolder and harder in
          their iniquity. Yet, for all this, we will not be moved. We have not run as uncertain. No, no. My heart is
          ﬁxed, trusting in God. We have a whole Saviour. We can rejoice in His rich fullness. I long to be more devoted
          to God, more consecrated to Him. This world is too dark for me. Jesus said He would go away and prepare
          mansions for us, that where He is we may be also. Praise God for this. My heart leaps with joy at the cheering
          prospect.</p>
      <p>Religion is made to dwell too much in an iron case. Pure religion and undeﬁled leads us to a childlike
          simplicity. We want to pray and talk with humility, having a single eye to the glory of god. There has been
          too much of a form of godliness without the power. The outpouring of the Spirit of God will lead to a grateful
          acknowledgment of the same; and while we feel and realize the wondrous love of God, we shall not hold our
          peace, we shall sacriﬁce to God with the voice of thanksgiving and make melody to Him with our hearts and
          voices. Let us plant our feet upon the Rock of Ages and then we will have abiding support and consolation. Our
          soul will repose in God with unshaken conﬁdence.</p>
      <p>Why do we so seldom visit the fountain when it is full and free? Our souls often need to drink at the fountain
          in order to be refreshed and ﬂourish in the Lord. Salvation we must have. Without vital godliness our religion
          is vain. A form will be of no advantage to us. We must have the deep workings of the Spirit of
          <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 2a, 1856.</p>
