      <p><strong>Chap. 185 - Be One, as Christ and the Father are One</strong></p>
      <p>Now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine
          own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. John 17:11.</p>
      <p>Where shall we ﬁnd the purity, goodness, and holiness where we shall be secure? Where is the fold where no
          wolves will enter? I tell you ... the Lord has an organized body through whom He will work. There may be more
          than a score of Judases among them; there may be a rash Peter who will under circumstances of trial deny his
          Lord; there may be persons represented by John whom Jesus loved, but he may have a zeal that would destroy
          men’s lives by calling down ﬁre from heaven upon them to revenge an insult to Christ and to the truth. But the
          great Teacher seeks to give lessons of instruction to correct these existing evils. He is doing the same today
          with His church. He is pointing out their dangers. He is presenting before them the Laodicean message.</p>
      <p>He shows them that all selﬁshness, all pride, all <nobr>self-exaltation,</nobr> all unbelief and prejudice,
          which lead to resistance of the truth and turn away from the true light, are dangerous, and unless repented
          of, those who cherish these things will be left in darkness as was the Jewish nation. Let every soul now seek
          to answer the prayer of Christ. Let every soul echo that prayer in mind, in petitions, in exhortations, that
          they all may be one even as Christ is one with the Father, and work to this end. In the place of turning the
          weapons of warfare within our own ranks, let them be turned against the enemies of God and the truth. Echo the
          prayer of Christ with your whole heart: “Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given
          me, that they may be one, as we are.... I pray not</p>
      <p>that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil” (John
          <nobr>17:11-15)....</nobr></p>
      <p>The door of the heart must be opened to the Holy Spirit, for this is the sanctiﬁer, and the truth is the
          medium. There must be an acceptance of the truth as it is in Jesus. This is the only genuine sanctiﬁcation:
          “Thy word is truth.” Oh, read the prayer of Christ for unity, “Keep through thine own name those whom thou
          hast given me, that they may be one as we are.” The prayer of Christ is not only for those who are now His
          disciples, but for all those who shall believe on Christ through the words of His disciples, even to the end
          of the world....</p>
      <p>The Lord has had a church from that day, through all the changing scenes of time to the present period.... The
          Bible sets before us a model church. They are to be in unity with each</p>
      <p>other, and with God. When believers are united in Christ the living vine, the result is that they are one with
          Christ, full of sympathy and tenderness and <nobr>love.—Manuscript</nobr> 21, 1893.</p>
