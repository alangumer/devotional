    <h1>Children to Develop Well-Balanced Characters</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high.... He will be the sure foundation for</strong></p>
      <p>your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is the key to this
          treasure. Isaiah 33:5, 6, N.I.V.</p>
      <p>Guard your children from every objectionable inﬂuence possible; for in childhood they are more ready to receive
          impressions, either of moral dignity, purity, and loveliness of character, or of selﬁshness, impurity, and
          disobedience. Once let them become inﬂuenced by the spirit of murmuring, pride, vanity, and impurity, and the
          taint may be as indelible as life itself.</p>
      <p>It is because the home training is defective that the youth are so unwilling to submit to proper authority. I
          am a mother; I know whereof I speak when I say that youth and children are not only safer but happier under
          wholesome restraint than when following their own inclination. <nobr>—The</nobr> Adventist Home, 469,
          470.</p>
      <p>It should be the object of every parent to secure to his child a <nobr>well-balanced,</nobr> symmetrical
          character. This is a work of no small magnitude and <nobr>importance—a</nobr> work requiring earnest thought
          and prayer no less than patient, persevering effort. A right foundation must be laid, a framework, strong and
          ﬁrm, erected, and then day by day the work of building, polishing, perfecting must go
          <nobr>forward.—Counsels</nobr> to Parents and Teachers, pp. 107, 108.</p>
      <p>The physical, mental, and spiritual capabilities should be developed in order to form a properly balanced
          character. Children should be watched, guarded, and disciplined in order to successfully accomplish this. It
          requires skill and patient effort to mold the young in the right manner. Certain evil tendencies are to be
          carefully restrained and tenderly rebuked; the mind is to be stimulated in favor of the right. The child
          should be encouraged in attempting to govern self, and all this is to be done judiciously, or the purpose
          desired is frustrated.</p>
      <p>Parents may well inquire: “Who is sufﬁcient for these things?” God alone is their sufﬁciency, and if they leave
          Him out of the question, seeking not his aid and counsel, hopeless indeed is their task. But by prayer, by
          study of the Bible, and by earnest zeal on their part they may succeed nobly in this important duty and be
          repaid a hundredfold for all their time and care....</p>
      <p>The Bible, a volume rich in instruction, should be their textbook.... Impressions made</p>
      <p>upon the minds of the young are hard to efface. How important, then, that these impressions should be of the
          right sort, bending the elastic faculties of youth in the right direction.— Testimonies for the Church 4:197,
          198.</p>
