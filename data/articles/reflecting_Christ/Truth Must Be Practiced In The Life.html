      <p><strong>Let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 1 John
          3:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who are looking for the revelation of Christ in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, as King
          of kings and Lord of lords, in life and character will seek to represent Him to the world. “And every man that
          hath this hope in him puriﬁeth himself, even as he is pure.” They will hate sin and iniquity, even as Christ
          hated sin. They will keep the commandments of God, as Christ kept His Father’s commandments. They will realize
          that it is not enough to acquiesce in the doctrines of truth, but that the truth must be applied to the heart,
          practiced in the life, in order that the followers of Christ may be one with Him, and that men may be as pure
          in their sphere as God is in His sphere. There have been men in every generation who have claimed to be the
          sons of God, who paid tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and yet who led a godless life; for they neglected
          the weightier matters of the <nobr>law—mercy,</nobr> justice, and the love of God....</p>
      <p>The sons of God will not be like the worldling; for the truth received into the heart will be the means of
          purifying the soul, and transforming the character, and of making its receiver <nobr>like-minded</nobr> with
          God. Unless a man becomes <nobr>like-minded</nobr> with God, he is still in his natural depravity. If Christ
          is in the heart, He will appear in the home, in the workshop, in the marketplace, in the church. The power of
          the truth will be felt in elevating, ennobling the mind, and softening and subduing the heart, bringing the
          whole man into harmony with God. He who is transformed by the truth will shed a light upon the world. He that
          hath the hope of Christ in him will purify himself even as He is pure. The hope of Christ’s appearing is a
          large hope, a <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> hope. It is the hope of seeing the King in His beauty, and of being
          made like Him....</p>
      <p>He that abideth in Christ is perfected in the love of God, and his purposes, thoughts, words, and actions are
          in harmony with the will of God expressed in the commandments of His law. There is nothing in the heart of the
          man who abides in Christ that is at war with any precept of God’s law. Where the Spirit of Christ is in the
          heart, the character of Christ will be revealed, and there will be manifested gentleness under provocation,
          and patience under trial. “Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous,
          even as he is righteous.” Righteousness can be deﬁned only by God’s great moral standard, the Ten
          Commandments. There is no other rule by which to measure <nobr>character.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June
          20, 1895.</p>
