    <h1>The Repentant Sinner Accepted in Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the ﬁgures of the true; but
          into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Hebrews 9:24.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is our sacriﬁce, our substitute, our surety, our divine intercessor; He is made unto us righteousness,
          sanctiﬁcation, and redemption. “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the
          ﬁgures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.”</p>
      <p>The intercession of Christ in our behalf is that of presenting His divine merits in the offering of Himself to
          the Father as our substitute and surety; for He ascended up on high to make an atonement for our
          transgressions.... “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but</p>
      <p>that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins” (1 John 4:10). “He is able also to save
          them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them” (Hebrews
          7:25).</p>
      <p>From these scriptures it is evident that it is not God’s will that you should be distrustful, and torture your
          soul with the fear that God will not accept you because you are sinful and unworthy.... Present your case
          before Him, pleading the merits of the blood shed for you</p>
      <p>upon Calvary’s cross. Satan will accuse you of being a great sinner, and you must admit this, but you can say:
          “I know I am a sinner, and that is the reason I need a Saviour. Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
          ‘The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.’... I have no merit or goodness whereby I may
          claim salvation, but I present before God the <nobr>all-atoning</nobr> blood of the spotless Lamb of God,
          which taketh away the sin of the world. This is my only plea. The name of Jesus gives me access to the Father.
          His ear, His heart, is open to my faintest pleading, and He supplies my deepest necessities.”</p>
      <p>It is the righteousness of Christ that makes the penitent sinner acceptable to God and works his justiﬁcation.
          However sinful has been his life, if he believes in Jesus as his personal Saviour, he stands before God in the
          spotless robes of Christ’s imputed righteousness.</p>
      <p>The sinner so recently dead in trespasses and sins is quickened by faith in Christ. He sees by faith that Jesus
          is his Saviour, and alive forevermore, able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto God by Him. In the
          atonement made for him the believer sees such breadth, and length, and height, and depth of efﬁciency, sees
          such completeness of salvation, purchased at such an inﬁnite cost, that his soul is ﬁlled with praise and
          <nobr>thanksgiving.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, July 4, 1892.</p>
