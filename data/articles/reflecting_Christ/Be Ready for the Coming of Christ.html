    <h1>Be Ready for the Coming of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
          Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
          people, zealous of good works. Titus 2:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>This scripture teaches a very different lesson from that which is presented in the words of many who profess to
          believe the gospel. We are exhorted to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, and to look
          for the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. Some have made an objection to my
          work, because I teach that it is our duty to be looking for Christ’s personal appearing in the clouds of
          heaven. They have said, “You would think that the day of the Lord was right upon us to hear Mrs. White speak
          in reference to the coming of Christ; and she has been preaching on that same subject for the last forty
          years, and the Lord has not yet come.”</p>
      <p>This very objection might have been brought against the words of Christ Himself. He said by the mouth of the
          beloved disciple, “Behold, I come quickly,” and John responds, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” Jesus spoke these
          words as words of warning and encouragement to His people; and why should we not heed them? The Lord has said
          that it is the faithful who will be found watching and waiting for Him. It was the unfaithful servant who
          said, “My Lord delayeth his coming,” and began to smite his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the
          drunken.</p>
      <p>The exact time of Christ’s second coming is not revealed. Jesus said, No man knoweth the day nor the hour. But
          He also gave signs of His coming, and said, “When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at
          the doors.” He bade them, as the signs of His coming should appear, “Look up, and lift up your heads; for your
          redemption draweth nigh.” And in view of these things the apostle wrote: “Ye, brethren, are not in darkness,
          that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day.”
          Since we know not the hour of Christ’s coming, we must live soberly and godly in this present world, “Looking
          for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” ...</p>
      <p>His people are to preserve their peculiar character as His representatives. There is work for every one of them
          to do. The rich should bring their means, the honored their inﬂuence, the learned their wisdom, the poor their
          virtue, if they would be effective workers with God. They are to bring themselves into right relation with
          God, that they may reﬂect the light of the glory of God that shines in the face of Jesus Christ.... They are
          to warn men of the</p>
      <p>coming judgments. They are to represent Christ to the <nobr>people.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 24,
          1889.</p>
