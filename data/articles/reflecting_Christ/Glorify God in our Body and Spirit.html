    <h1>Glorify God in our Body and Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
          God’s. 1 Corinthians 6:20.</strong></p>
      <p>How shall we follow Him to learn of Him who is our teacher? We can search His Word, and become acquainted with
          His life and works. His words we are to receive as bread for our souls. In every sphere where man shall be
          placed, the Lord Jesus has left us His footprints. We do well to follow Him. The Spirit by which He spake, we
          must cherish; we are to present the truth as it is in Jesus. We are to follow Him especially in
          <nobr>heart-purity,</nobr> in love. Self must be hid with Christ in God; then when Christ who is our life
          shall appear, we also shall appear with Him in glory....</p>
      <p>By the inspiration of the Spirit of God, Paul the apostle writes that “whatsoever ye do,” even the natural act
          of eating or drinking, should be done, not to gratify a perverted appetite, but under a sense of
          <nobr>responsibility—“do</nobr> all to the glory of God.” Every part of the man is to be guarded; we are to
          beware lest that which is taken into the stomach shall banish from the mind high and holy thoughts.</p>
      <p>May I not do as I please with myself? ask some, as if we were seeking to deprive them of a great good, when we
          present before them the necessity of eating intelligently, and conforming all their habits to the laws God has
          established.</p>
      <p>There are rights which belong to every individual. We have an individuality and an identity that is our own. No
          one can submerge his identity in that of any other. All must act for themselves, according to the dictates of
          their own conscience. As regards our responsibility and inﬂuence, we are amenable to God as deriving our life
          from Him. This we do not obtain from humanity, but from God only. We are His by creation and by redemption.
          Our very bodies are not our own, to treat as we please, to cripple by habits that lead to decay, making it
          impossible to render to God perfect service. Our lives and all our faculties belong to Him. He is caring for
          us every moment; He keeps the living machinery in action; if we were left to run it for one moment, we should
          die. We are absolutely dependent upon God.</p>
      <p>A great lesson is learned when we understand our relation to God, and His relation to us. The words “Know ye
          not that ... ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price” should be hung in memory’s hall, that we may
          ever recognize God’s right to our talents, our property, our inﬂuence, our individual selves. We are to learn
          how to treat this gift of God, in mind, in soul, in body, that as Christ’s purchased possession, we may do Him
          healthful, savory [pleasing] service.— Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 9, pp. 58, 59.</p>
