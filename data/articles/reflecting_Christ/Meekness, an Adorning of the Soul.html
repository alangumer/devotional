    <h1>Meekness, an Adorning of the Soul</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. Psalm
          149:4.</strong></p>
      <p>The most precious fruit of sanctiﬁcation is the grace of meekness. When this grace presides in the soul, the
          disposition is molded by its inﬂuence. There is a continual waiting upon God and a submission of the will to
          His. The understanding grasps every divine truth, and the will bows to every divine precept, without doubting
          or murmuring. True meekness softens and subdues the heart and gives the mind a ﬁtness for the engrafted Word.
          It brings the thoughts into obedience to Jesus Christ. It opens the heart to the Word of God, as Lydia’s was
          opened. It places us with Mary, as learners at the feet of Jesus. “The meek will he guide in judgment: and the
          meek will he teach his way” (Psalm 25:9).</p>
      <p>The language of the meek is never that of boasting. Like the child Samuel, they pray, “Speak, Lord; for thy
          servant heareth” (1 Samuel 3:9)....</p>
      <p>Meekness in the school of Christ is one of the marked fruits of the Spirit. It is a grace wrought by the Holy
          Spirit as a sanctiﬁer, and enables its possessor at all times to control a rash and impetuous temper. When the
          grace of meekness is cherished by those who are naturally sour or hasty in disposition, they will put forth
          the most earnest efforts to subdue their unhappy temper. Every day they will gain <nobr>self-control,</nobr>
          until that which is unlovely and unlike Jesus is conquered. They become assimilated to the Divine Pattern,
          until they can obey the inspired injunction, “Be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath” (James
          1:19)....</p>
      <p>Meekness is the inward adorning, which God estimates as of great price. The apostle speaks of this as more
          excellent and valuable than gold or pearls or costly array. While the outward adorning beautiﬁes only the
          mortal body, the ornament of meekness adorns the soul and connects ﬁnite man with the inﬁnite God. This is the
          ornament of God’s own choice. He who garnished the heavens with the orbs of light has by the same Spirit
          promised that “he will beautify the meek with salvation.” Angels of heaven will register as best adorned those
          who put on the Lord Jesus and walk with Him in meekness and lowliness of mind.</p>
      <p>There are high attainments for the Christian. He may ever be rising to higher <nobr>attainments.—The</nobr>
          Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>14-16.</nobr></p>
