    <h1>Faith Qualiﬁes for Us the Royal Line</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. Hebrews 11:1,
          N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>How often those who trusted the Word of God, though in themselves utterly helpless, have withstood the power of
          the whole <nobr>world—Enoch,</nobr> pure in heart, holy in life, holding fast his faith in the triumph of
          righteousness against a corrupt and scofﬁng generation; Noah and his household against the men of his time,
          men of the greatest physical and mental strength and the most debased in morals; the children of Israel at the
          Red Sea, a helpless, terriﬁed multitude of slaves, against the mightiest army of the mightiest nation on the
          globe; David, a shepherd lad, having God’s promise of the throne, against Saul, the established monarch, bent
          on holding fast his power; Shadrach and his companions in the ﬁre, and Nebuchadnezzar on the throne; Daniel
          among the lions, his enemies in the high places of the kingdom; Jesus on the cross, and the Jewish priests and
          rulers forcing even the Roman governor to work their will; Paul in chains led to a criminal’s death, Nero the
          despot of a world empire.</p>
      <p>Such examples are not found in the Bible only. They abound in every record of human progress. The Vaudois and
          the Huguenots, Wycliffe and Huss, Jerome and Luther, Tyndale and Knox, Zinzendorf and Wesley, with multitudes
          of others, have witnessed to the power of God’s Word against human power and policy in support of evil. These
          are the world’s true nobility. This is its royal line. In this line the youth of today are called to take
          their places.</p>
      <p>Faith is needed in the smaller no less than in the greater affairs of life. In all our daily interests and
          occupations the sustaining strength of God becomes real to us through an abiding trust....</p>
      <p>Only the sense of God’s presence can banish the fear that, for the timid child, would make life a burden. Let
          him ﬁx in his memory the promise, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
          delivereth them.” Let him read that wonderful story of Elisha in the mountain city, and, between him and the
          hosts of armed foemen, a mighty encircling band of heavenly angels. Let him read how to Peter, in prison and
          condemned to death, God’s angel appeared; how, past the armed guards, the massive doors and great iron gateway
          with their bolts and bars, the angel led God’s servant forth in safety....</p>
      <p>In no less marked a manner than He wrought then will He work now wherever there are hearts of faith to be
          channels of His power.— Education, <nobr>254-256.</nobr></p>
