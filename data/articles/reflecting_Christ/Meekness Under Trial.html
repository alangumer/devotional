    <h1>Meekness Under Trial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God
          more courageously and fearlessly. Philippians 1:14, N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>By his [Paul’s] example, Christians were impelled to greater energy as advocates of the cause from the public
          labors of which Paul had been withdrawn. In these ways were the apostle’s bonds inﬂuential, so that when his
          power and usefulness seemed cut off, and to all appearance he could do the least, then it was that he gathered
          sheaves for Christ in ﬁelds from which he seemed wholly excluded.</p>
      <p>Before the close of that two years’ imprisonment, Paul was able to say, “My bonds in Christ are manifest in all
          the palace, and in all other places” (Philippians 1:13), and among those who sent greetings to the Philippians
          he mentions chieﬂy them “that are of Caesar’s household” (chap. 4:22).</p>
      <p>Patience as well as courage has its victories. By meekness under trial, no less than by boldness in enterprise,
          souls may be won to Christ. The Christian who manifests patience and cheerfulness under bereavement and
          suffering, who meets even death itself with the peace and calmness of an unwavering faith, may accomplish for
          the gospel more than he could have effected by a long life of faithful labor. Often when the servant of God is
          withdrawn from active duty, the mysterious providence which our shortsighted vision would lament is designed
          by God to accomplish a work that otherwise would never have been done.</p>
      <p>Let not the follower of Christ think, when he is no longer able to labor openly and actively for God and His
          truth, that he has no service to render, no reward to secure. Christ’s true witnesses are never laid aside. In
          health and sickness, in life and death, God uses them still. When through Satan’s malice the servants of
          Christ have been persecuted, their active labors hindered, when they have been cast into prison, or dragged to
          the scaffold or to the stake, it was that truth might gain a greater triumph. As these faithful ones sealed
          their testimony with their blood, souls hitherto in doubt and uncertainty were convinced of the faith of
          Christ and took their stand courageously for Him. From the ashes of the martyrs has sprung an abundant harvest
          for God....</p>
      <p>The apostle and his associate workers might have argued that it would be vain to call to repentance and faith
          in Christ the servants of Nero.... But Paul did not reason thus; in faith</p>
      <p>he presented the gospel to these souls, and among those who heard were some who decided to obey at any cost.
          Notwithstanding obstacles and dangers, they would accept the light, and trust God to help them let their light
          shine forth to <nobr>others.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>464-466.</nobr></p>
