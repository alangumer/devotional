      <p><strong>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:48.</strong></p>
      <p>The ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. As the Son of man was perfect in His life, so His followers
          are to be perfect in their life. Jesus was in all things made like unto His brethren. He became ﬂesh, even as
          we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the
          lot of man; yet He was the blameless Son of God. He was God in the ﬂesh. His character is to be ours....</p>
      <p>Christ is the ladder that Jacob saw, the base resting on the earth, and the topmost round reaching to the gate
          of heaven, to the very threshold of glory. If that ladder had failed by a single step of reaching the earth,
          we should have been lost. But Christ reaches us where we are. He took our nature and overcame, that we through
          taking His nature might overcome. Made “in the likeness of sinful ﬂesh” (Romans 8:3), He lived a sinless life.
          Now by His divinity He lays hold upon the throne of heaven, while by His humanity He reaches us. He bids us by
          faith in Him attain to the glory of the character of God. Therefore are we to be perfect, even as our “Father
          which is in heaven is perfect.”</p>
      <p>Jesus had shown in what righteousness consists, and had pointed to God as its source. Now He turned to
          practical duties. In almsgiving, in prayer, in fasting, He said, let nothing be done to attract attention or
          win praise to self. Give in sincerity, for the beneﬁt of the suffering poor. In prayer, let the soul commune
          with God. In fasting, go not with the head bowed down, and heart ﬁlled with thoughts of self.... It is he who
          yields himself</p>
      <p>most unreservedly to God that will render Him the most acceptable service. For through fellowship with God men
          become workers together with Him in presenting His character in humanity.</p>
      <p>The service rendered in sincerity of heart has great recompense. “Thy Father which seeth in secret himself
          shall reward thee openly.” By the life we live through the grace of Christ the character is formed. The
          original loveliness begins to be restored to the soul. The attributes of the character of Christ are imparted,
          and the image of the Divine begins to shine forth. The faces of men and women who walk and work with God
          express the peace of heaven. They are surrounded with the atmosphere of heaven. For these souls the kingdom of
          God has begun. They have Christ’s joy, the joy of being a blessing to humanity. They have the honor of being
          accepted for the Master’s use; they are trusted to do His work in His <nobr>name.—The</nobr> Desire of Ages,
          <nobr>311-312.</nobr></p>
