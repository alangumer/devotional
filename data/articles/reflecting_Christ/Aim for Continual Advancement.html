    <h1>Aim for Continual Advancement</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. Proverbs 4:23. Truly earnest
          men are few in our world, but they are greatly needed. The example of an energetic person is
          <nobr>far-reaching;</nobr> he has an electric power over others. He meets obstacles in his work; but he has
          the push in him, and instead of allowing his way to be hedged up, he</strong></p>
      <p>breaks down every barrier....</p>
      <p>There are thorns in every path. All who follow the Lord’s leading must expect to meet with disappointments,
          crosses, and losses. But a spirit of true heroism will help them to overcome these. Many greatly magnify
          seeming difﬁculties, and then begin to pity themselves and give way to despondency. Such need to make an
          entire change in themselves. They need to discipline themselves to put forth exertion, and to overcome all
          childish feelings. They should determine that life shall not be spent in working at triﬂes. Let them resolve
          to accomplish something, and then do it.</p>
      <p>Many make good resolutions, but they are always going to do something and never get to it. About all their
          resolutions amount to is talk. In many cases, if they had more energy and accomplished something in spite of
          obstacles, they would have far better health.</p>
      <p>Everyone should have an aim, an object, in life. The loins of the mind should be girded up, and the thoughts be
          trained to keep to the point as the compass to the pole. The mind should be directed in the right channel,
          according to <nobr>well-formed</nobr> plans. Then every step will be a step in advance. No time will be lost
          in following vague ideas and random plans. Worthy purposes should be kept constantly in view, and every
          thought and act should tend to their accomplishment. Let there ever be a ﬁxedness of purpose to carry out that
          which is undertaken.</p>
      <p>Success or failure in this life depends much upon the manner in which the thoughts are disciplined. If they are
          controlled as God directs that they shall be, they will be upon those subjects which will lead to greater
          devotion. If the thoughts are right, the words will be right....</p>
      <p>The afternoon sun of ... life may be more mellow and productive of fruit than the morning sun. It may continue
          to increase in size and brightness until it drops behind the western hills.... Keep your heart and mind young
          by continuous exercise....</p>
      <p>The Bible is the best book in the world for intellectual culture. The grand themes presented in it, the
          digniﬁed simplicity with which these themes are handled, the light which it sheds upon the mysteries of
          heaven, bring strength and vigor to the <nobr>understanding.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 6, 1886.</p>
