    <h1>Revelation of God’s Glory in Humanity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
          Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 1 John 1:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ does not bid His followers strive to shine. He says, Let your light shine. If you have received the
          grace of God, the light is in you. Remove the obstructions, and the Lord’s glory will be revealed. The light
          will shine forth to penetrate and dispel the darkness. You cannot help shining within the range of your
          inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>The revelation of His own glory in the form of humanity will bring heaven so near to men that the beauty
          adorning the inner temple will be seen in every soul in whom the Saviour dwells. Men will be captivated by the
          glory of an abiding Christ. And in currents of praise and thanksgiving from the many souls thus won to God,
          glory will ﬂow back to the great Giver....</p>
      <p>Christ is coming with power and great glory. He is coming with His own glory and with the glory of the Father.
          He is coming with all the holy angels with Him. While all the world is plunged in darkness, there will be
          light in every dwelling of the saints. They will catch the ﬁrst light of His second appearing. The unsullied
          light will shine from His splendor, and Christ the Redeemer will be admired by all who have served Him. While
          the wicked ﬂee from His presence, Christ’s followers will rejoice. The patriarch Job, looking down to the time
          of Christ’s second advent, said, “Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not a stranger”
          (Job 19:27, margin).</p>
      <p>To His faithful followers Christ has been a daily companion and familiar friend. They have lived in close
          contact, in constant communion with God. Upon them the glory of the Lord has risen. In them the light of the
          knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ has been reﬂected. Now they rejoice in the undimmed
          rays of the brightness and glory of the King in His majesty. They are prepared for the communion of heaven;
          for they have heaven in their hearts....</p>
      <p>“And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of
          mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and
          give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.... And he
          saith unto me, Write, Blessed are</p>
      <p>they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb” (Revelation <nobr>19:6-9).</nobr> “He is Lord of
          lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful” (chap.
          <nobr>17:14).—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, 420, 421.</p>
