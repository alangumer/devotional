    <h1>The Transforming Power of the Holy Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>[God] hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit. 1 Thessalonians 4:8.</strong></p>
      <p>When the power of the Holy Spirit is appreciated and felt in the heart, far less of self will be exhibited, and
          far more of the feeling of human brotherhood will be revealed. Our part is not to exhibit self, but to let the
          Holy Spirit work in us. Thus, <nobr>self-deceived</nobr> men and women may be rescued from delusion.</p>
      <p>All, high or low, if they are unconverted, are on one common platform. Men may turn from one doctrine to
          another. This is being done, and will be done.... Yet they may know</p>
      <p>nothing of the meaning of the words, “A new heart also will I give you.” Accepting new theories, and uniting
          with a church, do not bring new life to anyone, even though the church with which he unites may be established
          on the true foundation. Connection with a church does not take the place of conversion. To subscribe the name
          to a church creed is not of the least value to anyone if the heart is not truly changed.</p>
      <p>This question is a serious one, and its meaning should be fully realized. Men may be church members, and may
          apparently work earnestly, performing a round of duties from year to year, and yet be unconverted.... But when
          the truth is received as truth by the heart,</p>
      <p>it has passed through the conscience, and has captivated the soul with its pure principles. It is placed in the
          heart by the Holy Spirit, who reveals its beauty to the mind, that its transforming power may be seen in the
          character....</p>
      <p>With the great truth we have been privileged to receive, we should, and under the Holy Spirit’s power we could,
          become living channels of light. We could then approach the mercy seat; and seeing the bow of promise, kneel
          with contrite hearts, and seek the kingdom of heaven with a spiritual violence that would bring its own
          reward. We would take it by force, as did Jacob. Then our message would be the power of God unto salvation.
          Our supplications would be full of earnestness, full of a sense of our great need; and we would not be denied.
          The truth would be expressed by life and character, and by lips touched with the living coal from off God’s
          altar.</p>
      <p>When this experience is ours, we shall be lifted out of our poor, cheap selves that we have cherished so
          tenderly. We shall empty our hearts of the corroding power of selﬁshness, and shall be ﬁlled with praise and
          gratitude to God. We shall magnify the Lord, the God of all grace, who has magniﬁed Christ. And He will reveal
          His power through us, making us as sharp sickles in the harvest ﬁeld. God calls upon His people to reveal
          <nobr>Him.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 14, 1899.</p>
