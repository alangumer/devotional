    <h1>Faith that Works by Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. Proverbs
          3:5.</strong></p>
      <p>When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be borne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is
          wholly distinct from faith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His Word, are facts that even Satan
          and his hosts cannot at heart deny. The Bible says that “the devils also believe, and tremble” (James 2:19);
          but this is not faith. Where there is not only a belief in God’s Word, but a submission of the will to Him;
          where the heart is yielded to Him, the affections ﬁxed upon Him, there is <nobr>faith—faith</nobr> that works
          by love and puriﬁes the soul.</p>
      <p>Through this faith the heart is renewed in the image of God. And the heart that in its unrenewed state is not
          subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, now delights in its holy precepts, exclaiming with the
          psalmist, “O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day” (Psalm 119:97). And the righteousness of the
          law is fulﬁlled in us, “who walk not after the ﬂesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans 8:1).</p>
      <p>There are those who have known the pardoning love of Christ and who really desire to be children of God, yet
          they realize that their character is imperfect, their life faulty, and they are ready to doubt whether their
          hearts have been renewed by the Holy Spirit. To such I would say, Do not draw back in despair. We shall often
          have to bow down and weep at the feet of Jesus because of our shortcomings and mistakes, but we are not to be
          discouraged. Even if we are overcome by the enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God. No;
          Christ is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Said the beloved John, “These things
          write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
          righteous” (1 John 2:1).</p>
      <p>And do not forget the words of Christ, “the Father himself loveth you” (John 16:27). He desires to restore you
          to Himself, to see His own purity and holiness reﬂected in you. And if you will but yield yourself to Him, He
          that hath begun a good work in you will carry it forward to the day of Jesus Christ. Pray more fervently;
          believe more fully....</p>
      <p>The less we see to esteem in ourselves, the more we shall see to esteem in the inﬁnite purity and loveliness of
          our Saviour. A view of our sinfulness drives us to Him who can pardon; and when the soul, realizing its
          helplessness, reaches out after Christ, He will reveal Himself in power. The more our sense of need drives us
          to Him and to the Word of God, the more exalted views we shall have of His character, and the more fully we
          shall reﬂect His <nobr>image.—Steps</nobr> to Christ, <nobr>63-65.</nobr></p>
