      <p><strong>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10. The whole heavenly
          universe are intensely interested in every penitent soul that comes</strong></p>
      <p>to Jesus; and they are interested, too, in the <nobr>impenitent—in</nobr> those whom they hope to see saved by
          repentance and reformation. Angels are watching our every act. They are familiar with every word uttered. They
          are intensely desirous of seeing us value above all else the instruction of God’s Word. They desire us to
          learn Christ’s meekness and <nobr>lowliness—the</nobr> highest of all sciences, the science of gladness and
          humility and love through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>The angels desire that we shall learn that the Son of man came “to save that which was lost.” Christ came not
          to save that which is good and righteous, but “that which was lost.” Brethren and sisters, when you see a soul
          slipping away from the truth, and endangering his hope of eternal salvation, press close to his side, and seek
          to help him in every way you can. Inquire into his needs; pray with him; labor kindly, patiently, with him;
          never despair of helping him.</p>
      <p>Church members have a work to do along the line of taking an interest in the youth. They should shake hands
          with them, and manifest a kindly interest in their welfare. Let us shield the youth, so far as possible, from
          worldly temptations and allurements. If possible, let us ﬁnd some employment for them, whereby their minds may
          be occupied with that which is ennobling. This is genuine <nobr>ministry—a</nobr> ministry that God approves,
          and that lifts up before the one who ministers, as well as before the one ministered unto, a standard against
          the enemy. Satan cannot overcome by his wiles those who in word and deed are ministers of
          righteousness....</p>
      <p>To everyone is given the privilege of helping his fellow men to place their feet on the Rock of Ages....</p>
      <p>Christ never ceases to seek us when we wander from the fold. With unwearying steps He searches until He ﬁnds
          us, and brings us back to His fold. Again and again we would have perished, had it not been for His loving
          care.... Little do we realize the strength of the</p>
      <p>forces that are now at work in this world. The whole heavenly host are seeking to save that which was lost; the
          fallen angels are working with a power from beneath to counteract the efforts of Christ and His
          colaborers....</p>
      <p>May God help us to ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith, and to clothe ourselves with the whole armor, and, having done
          all, to stand.... Let us watch for souls as do those that must give an</p>
      <p><nobr>account.—Manuscript</nobr> 102, 1904.</p>
