    <h1>Follow Christ in Service and Self-Denial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
          likeness of men. Philippians 2:7.</strong></p>
      <p>How many there are who accept Christ, and apparently live a Christian life, until their circumstances change!
          Perhaps they come into the possession of property. Thus God tests them, to see if they will be wise stewards.
          But they fail to endure the proving. They use for <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation</nobr> that which they should devote
          to feeding the hungry and clothing the naked. In want and distress, God’s children are calling to Him. Many
          are dying for want of the necessaries of life....</p>
      <p>There is a world to be warned. To us has been entrusted this work. At any cost we must practice the truth. We
          are to stand as <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> minutemen, willing to suffer the loss of life itself, if need be,
          in the service of God. There is a great work to be done in a short time.... Everyone who is ﬁnally crowned
          victor will, by noble, determined effort to serve</p>
      <p>God, have earned the right to be clothed with Christ’s righteousness. To enter the crusade against Satan,
          bearing aloft the bloodstained banner of the cross of <nobr>Christ—this</nobr> is the duty of every
          Christian....</p>
      <p>The most difﬁcult sermon to preach and the hardest to practice is <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> The greedy sinner,
          self, closes the door to the good which might be done, but which is not done because money is invested for
          selﬁsh purposes. But it is impossible for anyone to retain the favor of God and enjoy communion with the
          Saviour, and at the same time be indifferent to the interests of his fellow beings who have no life in Christ,
          who are perishing in their sins.</p>
      <p>Christ has left us a wonderful example of <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> He pleased not Himself, but spent His
          life in the service of others. He made sacriﬁces at every step, sacriﬁces which none of His followers can ever
          make, because they have never occupied the position He occupied before He came to this earth. He was commander
          of the heavenly host, but He came here to suffer for sinners. He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor,
          that through His poverty we might be made rich. Because He loved us, He laid aside His glory and took upon Him
          the form of a servant. He gave His life for us. What are we giving for Him? ...</p>
      <p>As we follow Him in the path of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> lifting the cross and bearing it after Him to His
          Father’s home, we shall reveal in our lives the beauty of the <nobr>Christ-life.</nobr> At the altar of
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce—the</nobr> appointed place of meeting between God and the <nobr>soul—we</nobr> receive
          from the hand of God the celestial torch which searches the heart, revealing the need of an abiding
          <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 31, 1907.</p>
