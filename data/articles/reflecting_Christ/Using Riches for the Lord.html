    <h1>Using Riches for the Lord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. Psalm 62:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Listen to the words of your Redeemer: “... Riches are mine. I have placed them in your hands to be wisely
          employed in My service, to aid the suffering, to invest in opening the gospel to those who are in darkness.
          Riches must not be your trust, your god, or your saviour.”</p>
      <p>The channels for doing good are many, and they stand wide open. Your barns are large, too large already. If
          they overﬂow, instead of building larger, send your treasure before you into heaven. There are widows to feed,
          orphans to be taken under the guardianship of your home, and share your ample stores; there are souls
          perishing for the bread of life; missions are to be supported, meetinghouses to be built. If God’s cause
          demands a part, not only of your interest, but of your principal, you are to give back to Him His own. He
          calls upon you to sow now, that you may reap your harvest with eternal joy.</p>
      <p>God’s gifts increase as they are imparted. We see this illustrated in the case of the poor widow whom the
          prophet Elisha, by a miracle, relieved from debt. She had only one jar of oil; but the prophet told her to
          borrow vessels of her neighbors, and the oil poured from that one jar continued to ﬂow till all the vessels
          were ﬁlled. The supply ceased only when no more vessels were brought to receive it. So it will be now. So long
          as we let the gifts of God ﬂow into channels of good, the Lord will supply the ﬂow.</p>
      <p>Christ says to His sons and daughters, “Ye are the light of the world.” But who gave you light? You did not
          have it in you naturally. God is the source of light; the truth has shone into our hearts, to be reﬂected to
          others. True love to God will produce love to man. This is what we <nobr>need—love</nobr> that is patient,
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing,</nobr> persevering, intelligent, practical.</p>
      <p>The Lord has given you means, that in putting it to a right use you may develop good and noble traits of
          character....</p>
      <p>The Lord is coming. You have no time to lose. You are not to do as did the inhabitants of the antediluvian
          <nobr>world—plant</nobr> and build, eat and drink, marry and give in marriage, the same as the careless
          worldling. Let the books of heaven present a different record from that which now appears. Make haste to
          redeem the time; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth
          <nobr>not.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, January 14, 1886.</p>
