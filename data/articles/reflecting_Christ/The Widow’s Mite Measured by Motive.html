    <h1>The Widow’s Mite Measured by Motive</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all. Luke
          21:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The poor widow who cast two mites into the treasury of the Lord showed love, faith, and benevolence. She gave
          all that she had, trusting to God’s care for the uncertain future. Her little gift was pronounced by our
          Saviour the greatest that day cast into the treasury. Its value was measured, not by the worth of the coin,
          but by the purity of the motive which prompted her.</p>
      <p>God’s blessing upon that sincere offering has made it the source of great results. The widow’s mite has been
          like a tiny stream ﬂowing down through the ages, widening and deepening in its course, and contributing in a
          thousand directions to the extension of the truth and the relief of the needy.</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of that small gift has acted and reacted upon thousands of hearts in every age and in every
          country. As the result, unnumbered gifts have ﬂowed into the treasury of the Lord from the liberal,
          <nobr>self-denying</nobr> poor. And again, her example has stimulated to good works thousands of
          <nobr>ease-loving,</nobr> selﬁsh, and doubting ones, and their gifts also have gone to swell the value of her
          offering.</p>
      <p>Liberality is a duty on no account to be neglected; but let not rich or poor for a moment entertain the thought
          that their offerings to God can atone for their defects of Christian character. Says the great apostle:
          “Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity,
          it proﬁteth me nothing,”</p>
      <p>Again, he sets forth the fruits of true charity: “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
          charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
          easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things,
          believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth.” If we would be accepted
          as the followers of Christ, we must bring forth the fruits of His Spirit; for our Saviour Himself declares:
          “Ye shall know them by their fruits.”</p>
      <p>It is to cultivate a spirit of benevolence in us that the Lord calls for our gifts and offerings. He is not
          dependent upon men for means to sustain His cause. He declares, by the prophet: “Every beast of the forest is
          mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the
          ﬁeld are mine.... The world is mine and the</p>
      <p>fulness <nobr>thereof”—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, January 21, 1886.</p>
