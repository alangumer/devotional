    <h1>The Law Of God Versus The Law Of Self</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
          righteous. Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much
          more abound. Romans 5:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>Adam did not set his mind in deﬁance against God, nor did he in any way speak against God; he simply went
          directly contrary to His express command. And how many today are doing the very same thing, and their guilt is
          of much greater magnitude because they have the example of Adam’s experience in disobedience and its terrible
          results to warn them of the consequences of transgressing the law of God. So they have clear light upon this
          subject, and no excuse for their guilt in denying and disobeying God’s authority. Adam did not stop to
          calculate the result of his disobedience.</p>
      <p>We can stand down here,...and with the aftersight we are privileged to have, we can see what it means to
          disobey God’s commandments. Adam yielded to temptation and as we have the matter of sin and its consequences
          laid so distinctly before us, we can read from cause to effect and see the greatness of the act is not that
          which constitutes sin; but the disobedience of God’s expressed will, which is a virtual denial of God,
          refusing the laws of His government. The happiness of man is in his obedience to the laws of God. In his
          obedience to God’s law he is surrounded as with a hedge and kept from the evil.</p>
      <p>No man can be happy and depart from God’s speciﬁed requirements, and set up a standard of his own which he
          decides he can safely follow. Then there would be a variety of standards to suit the different minds, and the
          government taken out of the Lord’s hands and human beings grasp the reins of government. The law of self is
          erected, the will of man is made supreme; and when the high and holy will of God is presented to be obeyed,
          respected, and honored the human will wants its own way...to do its own promptings, and there is a controversy
          between the human agent and the divine.</p>
      <p>The fall of our ﬁrst parents broke the golden chain of implicit obedience of the human will to the divine.
          Obedience has no longer been deemed an absolute necessity. The human agents follow their own imaginations
          which the Lord said of the inhabitants of the old world were evil and that continually. The Lord Jesus
          declares, “I have kept my Father’s commandments.” How? As a man. Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God. To the
          accusations of the Jews He stood forth in His pure, virtuous, holy character and challenged them, “Which of
          you convinceth me of <nobr>sin?”—Manuscript</nobr> 1, 1892.</p>
