    <h1>God’s Law Is The Law Of Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all
          your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.”’ Mark <nobr>12:30-31,</nobr>
          N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Love, the basis of creation and of redemption, is the basis of true education. This is made plain in the law
          that God has given as the guide of life.... To love Him, the inﬁnite, the</p>
      <p>omniscient one, with the whole strength and mind and heart, means the highest development of every power. It
          means that in the whole <nobr>being—the</nobr> body, the mind, as well as the <nobr>soul—the</nobr> image of
          God is to be restored.</p>
      <p>Like the ﬁrst is the second commandment, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” The law of love calls for
          the devotion of body, mind, and soul to the service of God and our fellow men. And this service, while making
          us a blessing to others, brings the greatest blessing to ourselves. Unselﬁshness underlies all true
          development....</p>
      <p>Lucifer in heaven desired to be ﬁrst in power and authority; he wanted to be God, to have the rulership of
          heaven; and to this end he won many of the angels to his side. When with his rebel host he was cast out from
          the courts of God, the work of rebellion and <nobr>self-seeking</nobr> was continued on earth. Through the
          temptation to <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> and ambition, Satan accomplished the fall of our ﬁrst parents; and
          from that time to the present the gratiﬁcation of human ambition and the indulgence of selﬁsh hopes and
          desires have proved the ruin of mankind.</p>
      <p>Under God, Adam was to stand at the head of the earthly family, to maintain the principles of the heavenly
          family. This would have brought peace and happiness. But the law that none “liveth to himself” Satan was
          determined to oppose. He desired to live for self. He sought to make himself a center of inﬂuence. It was this
          that had incited rebellion in heaven, and it was man’s acceptance of this principle that brought sin on earth.
          When Adam sinned, man broke away from the <nobr>heaven-ordained</nobr> center. A demon became the central
          power in the world. Where God’s throne should have been, Satan placed his throne. The world laid its homage,
          as a willing offering, at the feet of the enemy.</p>
      <p>The transgression of God’s law brought woe and death in its train. Through disobedience man’s powers were
          perverted, and selﬁshness took the place of love. His nature became so weakened that it was impossible for him
          to resist the power of evil.... Men had chosen a</p>
      <p>ruler who chained them to his car as captives.... Christ came to the world to show them</p>
      <p>that He had planted for them the tree of life, the leaves of which are for the healing of the
          <nobr>nations.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 16, 1913.</p>
