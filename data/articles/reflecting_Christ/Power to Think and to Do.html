    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. Job
          22:21.</strong></p>
      <p>The law of love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and soul to the service of God and our fellow men. And
          this service, while making us a blessing to others, brings the greatest blessing to ourselves. Unselﬁshness
          underlies all true development. Through unselﬁsh service we receive the highest culture of every faculty. More
          and more fully do we become partakers of the divine nature. We are ﬁtted for heaven; for we receive heaven
          into our hearts.</p>
      <p>Since God is the source of all true knowledge, it is ... the ﬁrst object of education to direct our minds to
          His own revelation of Himself. Adam and Eve received knowledge through direct communion with God; and they
          learned of Him through His works. All created things, in their original perfection, were an expression of the
          thought of God. To Adam and Eve nature was teeming with divine wisdom. But by transgression man was cut off
          from learning of God through direct communion and, to a great degree, through His works.</p>
      <p>The earth, marred and deﬁled by sin, reﬂects but dimly the Creator’s glory. It is true that His object lessons
          are not obliterated. Upon every page of the great volume of His created works may still be traced His
          handwriting. Nature still speaks of her Creator. Yet these revelations are partial and imperfect. And in our
          fallen state, with weakened powers and restricted vision, we are incapable of interpreting aright. We need the
          fuller revelation of Himself that God has given in His Written Word.</p>
      <p>The Holy Scriptures are the perfect standard of truth.... Every human being, created</p>
      <p>in the image of God, is endowed with a power akin to that of the <nobr>Creator—individuality,</nobr> power to
          think and to do. The men in whom this power is developed are the men who bear responsibilities, who are
          leaders in enterprise, and who inﬂuence character....</p>
      <p>Let students be directed to the sources of truth, to the vast ﬁelds opened for research in nature and
          revelation. Let them contemplate the great facts of duty and destiny, and the mind will expand and
          strengthen.... Instead of some master passion becoming a power to destroy,</p>
      <p>every motive and desire are brought into conformity to the great principles of right. As the perfection of His
          character is dwelt upon, the mind is renewed, and the soul is <nobr>re-created</nobr> in the image of
          God....</p>
      <p>Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God’s ideal for His children.
          <nobr>Godliness—godlikeness—is</nobr> the goal to be reached.— Education, <nobr>16-18.</nobr></p>
