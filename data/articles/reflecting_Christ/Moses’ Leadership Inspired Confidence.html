    <h1>Moses’ Leadership Inspired Conﬁdence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people to battle at Edrei. And the Lord said
          unto me; Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand.... And we
          smote him until none was left to him remaining.</strong></p>
      <p>Deuteronomy <nobr>3:1-3.</nobr></p>
      <p>Before them [Israel] lay the powerful and populous kingdom of Bashan, crowded with great stone cities that to
          this day excite the wonder of the world.... The houses</p>
      <p>were constructed of huge black stones, of such stupendous size as to make the buildings absolutely impregnable
          to any force that in those times could have been brought against them. It was a country ﬁlled with wild
          caverns, lofty precipices, yawning gulfs, and rocky strongholds. The inhabitants of this land, descendants
          from a giant race, were themselves of marvelous size and strength, and so distinguished for violence and
          cruelty as to be the terror of all surrounding nations; while Og, the king of the country, was remarkable for
          size and prowess, even in a nation of giants.</p>
      <p>But the cloudy pillar moved forward, and following its guidance the Hebrew hosts advanced to Edrei, where the
          giant king, with his forces, awaited their approach. Og had skillfully chosen the place of battle. The city of
          Edrei was situated upon the border of a tableland rising abruptly from the plain, and covered with jagged,
          volcanic rocks. It could be approached only by narrow pathways....</p>
      <p>When the Hebrews looked upon the lofty form of that giant of giants towering above the soldiers of his army;
          when they saw the hosts that surrounded him, and beheld the seemingly impregnable fortress, behind which
          unseen thousands were entrenched, the hearts of many in Israel quaked with fear. But Moses was calm and ﬁrm;
          the Lord had said concerning the king of Bashan, “Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people,
          and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which
          dwelt at Heshbon.”</p>
      <p>The calm faith of their leader inspired the people with conﬁdence in God. They trusted all to His omnipotent
          arm, and He did not fail them. Not mighty giants nor walled cities, armed hosts nor rocky fortresses, could
          stand before the Captain of the Lord’s host. The Lord led the army; the Lord discomﬁted [overthrew] the enemy.
          The Lord conquered in behalf of Israel. The giant king and his army were destroyed, and the Israelites soon
          took possession of the whole country....</p>
      <p>The hosts of Bashan had yielded before the mysterious power enshrouded in the cloudy
          <nobr>pillar.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, <nobr>435-438.</nobr></p>
      <p>The difﬁculties that seem so formidable, that ﬁll your soul with “dread, will vanish as you move forward in the
          path of obedience, humbly trusting in <nobr>God.”—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 437.</p>
