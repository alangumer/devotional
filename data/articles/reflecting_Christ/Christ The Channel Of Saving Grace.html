      <p><strong>Chap. 31 - Christ The Channel Of Saving Grace</strong></p>
      <p>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. Colossians 2:9.</p>
      <p>By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of
          man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey....</p>
      <p>In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a character the opposite of the character of
          Satan....</p>
      <p>Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in
          which He had no share, that we might be justiﬁed by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered
          the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. “With his stripes we are healed.”</p>
      <p>By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It
          was Satan’s purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become more
          closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to
          humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us.... To assure us
          of His</p>
      <p>immutable counsel of peace, God gave His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son to become one of the human family,
          forever to retain His human nature.... God has adopted human nature in the person of</p>
      <p>His Son, and has carried the same into the highest heaven. It is the “Son of man” who shares the throne of the
          universe. It is the “Son of man” whose name shall be called, “Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
          everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace” (Isaiah 9:6)....</p>
      <p>In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven are bound together. Christ gloriﬁed is our brother.
          Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of Inﬁnite Love....</p>
      <p>Through Christ’s redeeming work the government of God stands justiﬁed. The Omnipotent One is made known as the
          God of love. Satan’s charges are refuted, and his character unveiled. Rebellion can never again arise. Sin can
          never again enter the universe. Through eternal ages all are secure from apostasy. By love’s
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> the inhabitants of earth and heaven are bound to their Creator in bonds of
          indissoluble union.</p>
      <p>The work of redemption will be complete. In the place where sin abounded, God’s grace much more abounds.... Our
          little world, under the curse of sin the one dark blot in</p>
      <p>His glorious creation, will be honored above all other worlds in the universe of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Desire
          of Ages, <nobr>24-26.</nobr></p>
