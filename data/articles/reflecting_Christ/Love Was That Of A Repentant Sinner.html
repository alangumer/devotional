    <h1>Love Was That Of A Repentant Sinner</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and
          knoweth God. 1 John 4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The apostle John was distinguished above his brethren as “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” While not in the
          slightest degree cowardly, weak, or vacillating in character, he possessed an amiable disposition and a warm,
          loving heart. He seemed to have enjoyed, in a preeminent sense, the friendship of Christ, and he received many
          tokens of the Saviour’s conﬁdence and love. He was one of the three permitted to witness Christ’s glory upon
          the mount of transﬁguration and His agony in Gethsemane; and to the care of John our Lord conﬁded His mother
          in those last hours of anguish upon the cross.</p>
      <p>The Saviour’s affection for the beloved disciple was returned with all the strength of ardent devotion. John
          clung to Christ as the vine clings to the stately pillar. For his Master’s sake he braved the dangers of the
          judgment hall and lingered about the cross; and at the tidings that Christ had risen, he hastened to the
          sepulcher, in his zeal outstripping even the impetuous Peter.</p>
      <p>John’s love for his Master was not a mere human friendship, but it was the love of a repentant sinner, who felt
          that he had been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. He esteemed it the highest honor to work and suffer
          in the service of his Lord. His love for Jesus led him to love all for whom Christ died. His religion was of a
          practical character. He reasoned that love to God would be manifested in love to His children. “We love him,
          because he ﬁrst loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth
          not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?” (1 John 4:19, 20). The
          apostle’s life was in harmony with his teachings.</p>
      <p>The love which glowed in his heart for Christ, led him to put forth the most earnest, untiring labor for his
          fellow men, especially for his brethren in the Christian church....</p>
      <p>John desired to become like Jesus, and under the transforming inﬂuence of the love of Christ, he became meek
          and lowly of heart. Self was hid in Jesus. He was closely united to the Living Vine, and thus became a
          partaker of the divine nature. Such will ever be the result of communion with Christ. This is true
          <nobr>sanctiﬁcation.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>53-55.</nobr></p>
