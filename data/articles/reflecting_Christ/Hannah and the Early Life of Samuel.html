    <h1>Hannah and the Early Life of Samuel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men. 1 Samuel
          2:26.</strong></p>
      <p>The fulﬁllment of Hannah’s vow to dedicate her child to the Lord was not deferred until he could be presented
          at the tabernacle. From the earliest dawn of intellect she trained his infant mind to love and reverence God,
          and to regard himself as the Lord’s. By every familiar object surrounding him she sought to lead his thoughts
          up to the Creator.</p>
      <p>When separated from her child, the faithful mother’s solicitude did not cease. He was the subject of her
          prayers. Every year she made him a little coat, and when she came with her husband to the yearly sacriﬁce, she
          presented it to the child as a token of her love. With every stitch of that coat she had breathed a prayer
          that he might be pure, noble, and true. She did not ask that he might be great, but earnestly pleaded that he
          might be good.</p>
      <p>Her faith and devotion were rewarded. She saw her son, in the simplicity of childhood, walking in the love and
          fear of God. She saw him growing up to manhood in favor with God and man, humble, reverent, prompt in duty,
          and earnest in the service of his divine Master....</p>
      <p>Would that every mother could realize how great are her duties and her responsibilities, and how great will be
          the reward of faithfulness. The mother’s daily inﬂuence upon her children is preparing them for everlasting
          life or eternal death. She exercises in her home a power more decisive than the minister in the desk, or even
          the king upon his throne. The day of God will reveal how much the world owes to godly mothers for men who have
          been unﬂinching advocates of truth and <nobr>reform—men</nobr> who have been bold to do and dare, who have
          stood unshaken amid trials and temptations; men who chose the high and holy interests of truth and the glory
          of God, before worldly honor or life itself.</p>
      <p>When the Judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened; when the “well done” of the great Judge is
          pronounced, and the crown of immortal glory is placed upon the brow of the victor, many will raise their
          crowns in sight of the assembled universe, and pointing to their mother say, “She made me all I am through the
          grace of God. Her instruction, her prayers, have been blessed to my eternal salvation.”</p>
      <p>Samuel became a great man in the fullest sense, as God estimates character.... Young</p>
      <p>men should be trained to stand ﬁrm for the right amid the prevailing iniquity, to do all in their power to
          arrest the progress of vice, and to promote virtue, purity, and true manliness. The impressions made upon the
          mind and character in early life are deep and <nobr>abiding.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, November 3,
          1881.</p>
