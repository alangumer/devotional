    <h1>The Impress of Deity Seen in His Word</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. Colossians 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>In God’s Word we behold the power that laid the foundation of the earth and that stretched out the heavens.
          Here only can we ﬁnd a history of our race unsullied by human prejudice or human pride. Here are recorded the
          struggles, the defeats, and the victories of the greatest men this world has ever known. Here the great
          problems of duty and destiny are unfolded. The curtain that separates the visible from the invisible world is
          lifted, and we behold the conﬂict of the opposing forces of good and evil, from the ﬁrst entrance of sin to
          the ﬁnal triumph of righteousness and truth; and all is but a revelation of the character of God. In the
          reverent contemplation of the truths presented in His Word the mind...is brought into communion with the
          inﬁnite mind. Such a study will not only reﬁne and ennoble the character, but it cannot fail to expand and
          invigorate the mental powers.</p>
      <p>The teaching of the Bible has a vital bearing upon man’s prosperity in all the relations of this life. It
          unfolds the principles that are the cornerstone of a nation’s <nobr>prosperity—principles</nobr> with which is
          bound up the well being of society, and which are the safeguard of the family <nobr>—principles</nobr> without
          which no man can attain usefulness, happiness, and honor in this life, or can hope to secure the future,
          immortal life. There is no position in life, no phase of human experience, for which the teaching of the Bible
          is not an essential preparation. Studied and obeyed, the Word of God would give to the world men of stronger
          and more active intellect than will the closest application to all the subjects that human philosophy
          embraces. It would give men of strength and solidity of character, of keen perception and sound
          <nobr>judgment—men</nobr> who would be an honor to God and a blessing to the world.</p>
      <p>In the study of the sciences also we are to obtain a knowledge of the Creator. All true science is but an
          interpretation of the handwriting of God in the material world. Science brings from her research only fresh
          evidences of the wisdom and power of God. Rightly understood, both the book of nature and the Written Word
          make us acquainted with God by teaching us something of the wise and beneﬁcent laws through which He
          works....</p>
      <p>The impress of Deity, manifest in the pages of revelation, is seen upon the lofty mountains, the fruitful
          valleys, the broad, deep ocean. The things of nature speak to man of his Creator’s
          <nobr>love.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, <nobr>596-600.</nobr></p>
