    <h1>Obedience, the Fruit of Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
          above all people: for all the earth is mine. Exodus 19:5.</strong></p>
      <p><nobr>Obedience—the</nobr> service and allegiance of <nobr>love—is</nobr> the true sign of discipleship. Thus
          the Scripture says, “This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments” (1 John 5:3). “He that saith, I
          know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him,” (chap. 2:4). Instead of
          releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ,
          which enables us to render obedience.</p>
      <p>We do not earn salvation by our obedience, for salvation is the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But
          obedience is the fruit of faith. “Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
          Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not” (chap. 3:5, 6). Here is the true test. If we abide in Christ, if the
          love of God dwells in us, our feelings, our thoughts, our purposes, our actions, will be in harmony with the
          will of God as expressed in the precepts of His holy law. “Little children, let no man deceive you; he that
          doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous” (verse 7). Righteousness is deﬁned by the standard
          of God’s holy law, as expressed in the ten precepts given on Sinai.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>so-called</nobr> faith in Christ which professes to release men from the obligation of obedience to
          God is not faith, but presumption. “By grace are ye saved through faith” (Ephesians 2:8). But “faith, if it
          hath not works, is dead” (James 2:17). Jesus said of Himself before He came to earth, “I delight to do thy
          will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart” (Psalm 40:8). And just before He ascended again to heaven, He
          declare, “I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love” (John 15:10). The Scriptures says,
          “Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments” (1 John 2:3)....</p>
      <p>The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has <nobr>been—just</nobr> what it was in Paradise
          before the fall of our ﬁrst <nobr>parents—perfect</nobr> obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness.
          If eternal life were granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole universe would be
          imperiled. The way would be open for sin, with all its train of woe and misery, to be immortalized....</p>
      <p>The more our sense of need drives us to Him and to the Word of God, the more exalted views we shall have of His
          character, and the more fully we shall reﬂect His <nobr>image.—Steps</nobr> to Christ,
          <nobr>60-65.</nobr></p>
