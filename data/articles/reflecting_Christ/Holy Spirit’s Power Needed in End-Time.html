    <h1>Holy Spirit’s Power Needed in End-Time</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Holy Ghost shall teach you. Luke 12:12.</strong></p>
      <p>We are not to make less prominent the special truths that have separated us from the world, and made us what we
          are; for they are fraught with eternal interests. God has given us light in regard to the things that are now
          taking place, and with pen and voice we are to proclaim the truth to the world. But it is the life of Christ
          in the soul, it is the active principle of love imparted by the Holy Spirit, that alone will make our words
          fruitful. The love of Christ is the force and power of every message for God that ever fell from human
          lips.</p>
      <p>Day after day is passing into eternity, bringing us nearer to the close of probation. As never before we must
          pray for the Holy Spirit to be more abundantly bestowed upon us, and we must look for its sanctifying inﬂuence
          to come upon the workers, that those for whom they labor may know that they have been with Jesus and have
          learned of Him.</p>
      <p>We need spiritual eyesight, that we may see the designs of the enemy, and as faithful watchmen proclaim the
          danger. We need power from above, that we may understand, as far as the human mind can, the great themes of
          Christianity and their <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> principles.</p>
      <p>Those who are under the inﬂuence of the Spirit of God will not be fanatical, but calm and steadfast, free from
          extravagance in thought, word, or deed. Amid the confusion of delusive doctrines, the Spirit of God will be a
          guide and a shield to those who have not resisted the evidences of truth, silencing every other voice but that
          which comes from Him who is the truth.</p>
      <p>We are living in the last days, when error of a most deceptive character is accepted and believed, while truth
          is discarded. The Lord will hold both ministers and people responsible for the light shining upon them. He
          calls upon us to work diligently in gathering up the jewels of truth, and placing them in the framework of the
          gospel. In all their divine beauty they are to shine forth in the moral darkness of the world. This cannot be
          accomplished without the aid of the Holy Spirit, but with this aid we can do all things. When we are endowed
          with the Spirit, we take hold by faith of inﬁnite power.</p>
      <p>There is nothing lost of that which comes from God. The Saviour of the world sends His messages to the soul,
          that the darkness of error may be dispelled. The work of the Spirit is immeasurably great. It is from this
          source that power and efﬁciency come to the worker for <nobr>God.—Gospel</nobr> Workers, 288, 289.</p>
