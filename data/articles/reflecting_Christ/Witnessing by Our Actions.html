      <p><strong>Chap. 273 - Witnessing by Our Actions</strong></p>
      <p>Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. Galatians 6:9.</p>
      <p>Again and again I am instructed to charge our people with their individual responsibility to work, and believe,
          and pray. The reception of Bible truth will lead to continual <nobr>self-denial;</nobr> for
          <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> can never be found in a Christlike experience. Truly converted men and women will
          reveal the cross of Calvary in their daily actions. There are many <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists who do
          not understand that to accept the cause of Christ means to accept His cross. The only evidence they give in
          their lives of their discipleship is in the name they bear. But the true Christian regards his stewardship as
          a sacred thing. He perseveringly studies the Word, and yields up his life to the service of Christ.</p>
      <p>The word of encouragement is given, “Be not weary in well doing,” “always abounding in the work of the Lord.”
          There is a world to be saved, a work to be done that can be accomplished only by the proclamation of the
          gospel message. “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
          should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Should we not thank the Lord with heart and soul for His
          unspeakable gift? Should we not be willing to devote every capability and talent to the work of representing
          Christ before the world? ...</p>
      <p>“Good works” will begin to appear when the experience of repentance and conversion is brought into the life....
          It is ... by showing that we are changed in character, through a</p>
      <p>belief of the truth, that we make known to others the transforming power of the grace of <nobr>God.—The</nobr>
          Review and Herald, February 25, 1909.</p>
      <p>“Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God
          is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (Galatians 6:6, 7). Wonderful truth! This
          is a <nobr>two-edged</nobr> sword which cuts both ways. This life and death question is before the whole human
          race. The choice we make in this life will be our choice through all eternity. We shall receive either eternal
          life or eternal death. There is no middle ground, no second probation.</p>
      <p>We are called upon to overcome in this life as Christ overcame. Heaven has provided us with abundant
          opportunities and privileges, so that we may overcome as Christ overcame, and sit down with Him on His throne.
          But in order to be overcomers, there must be in our lives no petting of ﬂeshly inclinations. All selﬁshness
          must be cut out by the roots....</p>
      <p>The more the heart is wrapped up in Christ, the more secure is the treasure in the eternal
          <nobr>world.—The</nobr> S.D.A. Bible Commentary 6:1112.</p>
