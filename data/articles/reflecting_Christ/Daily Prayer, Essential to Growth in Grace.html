    <h1>Daily Prayer, Essential to Growth in Grace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 1 Peter
          4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>If we would develop a character which God can accept, we must form correct habits in our religious life. Daily
          prayer is as essential to growth in grace, and even to spiritual life itself, as is temporal food to physical
          <nobr>well-being.</nobr> We should accustom ourselves to often lift the thoughts to God in prayer. If the mind
          wanders, we must bring it back; by persevering effort, habit will ﬁnally make it easy. We cannot for one
          moment separate ourselves from Christ with safety. We may have His presence to attend us at every step, but
          only by observing the conditions which He has Himself laid down.</p>
      <p>Religion must be made the great business of life. Everything else should be held subordinate to this. All our
          powers of soul, body, and spirit must be engaged in Christian warfare. We must look to Christ for strength and
          grace, and we shall gain the victory as surely as Jesus died for us.</p>
      <p>We must come nearer to the cross of Christ. Penitence at the foot of the cross is the ﬁrst lesson of peace we
          have to learn. The love of Jesus— who can comprehend it? Inﬁnitely more tender and <nobr>self-denying</nobr>
          than a mother’s love! If we would know the value of a human soul, we must look in living faith upon the cross,
          and thus, begin the study which shall be the science and the song of the redeemed through all eternity. The
          value of our time and our talents can be estimated only by the greatness of the ransom paid for our
          redemption. What ingratitude we manifest toward God when we rob Him of His own by withholding from Him our
          affections and our service! Is it too much to give ourselves to Him who has sacriﬁced all for us? Can we
          choose the friendship of the world before the immortal honors which Christ <nobr>proffers—“to</nobr> sit with
          me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne”? ...</p>
      <p>Those who are ... working upon the plan of addition in obtaining the Christian graces, have the assurance that
          God will work upon the plan of multiplication in granting them the gifts of His Spirit.</p>
      <p>Peter addresses those who have obtained like precious faith: “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through
          the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.” By divine grace, all who will may climb the shining steps from
          earth to heaven, and at last, “with songs and everlasting joy,” enter through the gates into the
          <nobr>city.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 15, 1887.</p>
