    <h1>Christ Puts on Us His Perfection of Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Yield yourselves unto God,... and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. Romans
          6:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who are called of God to labor in word and doctrine should ever be learners in the school of Christ....
          Those who do not feel the importance of going on from strength to</p>
      <p>strength will not grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. All heaven is
          interested in the work that is going on in the earth today. The angels look with interest upon those who are
          honored in having a part to act as colaborers with God. When the servants of Christ have a realizing sense of
          the presence of One who is mighty to save, they will be ﬁlled with gratitude to God for the power of His
          grace.... Those who</p>
      <p>dedicate their all to Christ will learn how to win souls; for they will have a close connection with the
          Redeemer of the world....</p>
      <p>Jesus is the light of the world, and you are to fashion your life after His. You will ﬁnd help in Christ to
          form a strong, symmetrical, beautiful character. Satan cannot make of none effect the light shining forth from
          such character. The Lord has a work for each of us to do. He does not provide that we shall be sustained by
          the inﬂuence of human praise and petting; He means that every soul shall stand in the strength of the Lord.
          God has given us His best gift, even His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son, to uplift, ennoble, and ﬁt us, by
          putting on us His own perfection of character, for a home in His kingdom. Jesus came to our world and lived as
          He expects His followers to live. If we are <nobr>self-indulgent,</nobr> and too lazy to put forth earnest
          effort to cooperate with the wonderful work of God, we shall meet with loss in this life, and loss in the
          future, immortal life.</p>
      <p>God designs that we shall work, not in a despairing manner, but with strong faith and hope. As we search the
          Scriptures, and are enlightened to behold the wonderful condescension of the Father in giving Jesus to the
          world, that all who believe on Him should not perish but have everlasting life, we should rejoice with joy
          unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
      <p>Everything that can be gained by education, God means we shall use for the advancement of the truth. True,
          vital godliness must be reﬂected from the life and character, that the cross of Christ may be lifted up before
          the world, and the value of the soul be revealed in the light of the cross. Our minds must be opened to
          understand the Scriptures, that we may gain spiritual power by feeding upon the bread of
          <nobr>heaven.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 8, 1890.</p>
