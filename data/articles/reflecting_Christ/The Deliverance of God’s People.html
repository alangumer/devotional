      <p><strong>For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
          hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. Psalm 27:5.</strong></p>
      <p>With earnest longing, God’s people await the tokens of their coming King. As the watchmen are accosted, “What
          of the night?” the answer is given unfalteringly, “‘The morning cometh, and also the night’ (Isaiah 21:11,
          12). Light is gleaming upon the clouds above the mountaintops. Soon there will be the revealing of His glory.”
          ... The heavens glow with the dawning of eternal day, and like the melody of angel songs the words fall upon
          the ear: “Stand fast to your allegiance. Help is coming.” ...</p>
      <p>The precious Saviour will send help just when we need it. The way to heaven is consecrated by His footprints.
          Every thorn that wounds our feet has wounded His. Every cross that we are called to bear He has borne before
          us. The Lord permits conﬂicts, to prepare the soul for peace. The time of trouble is a fearful ordeal for
          God’s people; but it is the time for every true believer to look up, and by faith he may see the bow of
          promise encircling him....</p>
      <p>The eye of God, looking down the ages, was ﬁxed upon the crisis which His people are to meet, when earthly
          powers shall be arrayed against them. Like the captive exile, they will be in fear of death by starvation or
          by violence. But the Holy One who divided the Red Sea before Israel, will manifest His mighty power and turn
          their captivity. “They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I
          will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him” (Malachi 3:17).</p>
      <p>If the blood of Christ’s faithful witnesses were shed at this time, it would not, like the blood of the
          martyrs, be as seed sown to yield a harvest for God. Their ﬁdelity would not be a testimony to convince others
          of the truth; for the obdurate heart has beaten back the waves of mercy until they return no more. If the
          righteous were now left to fall a prey to their enemies, it would be a triumph for the prince of darkness.
          Says the psalmist: “In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle
          shall he hide me.”</p>
      <p>Christ has spoken: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself
          as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his
          place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity” (Isaiah 26:20, 21). Glorious will be the
          deliverance of those who have patiently waited for His coming and whose names are written in the book of
          life.— The Great Controversy, <nobr>632-634.</nobr></p>
