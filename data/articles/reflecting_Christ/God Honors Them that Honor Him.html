    <h1>God Honors Them that Honor Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Them that honour me I will honour. 1 Samuel 2:30.</strong></p>
      <p>You are God’s hired servant to give light, to give time, thought, tact, to His work; and if you do this, you
          will receive the approbation of your heavenly Father and the gift of eternal life....</p>
      <p>Be much in prayer. Let no person, or personal interest, separate you from God, who is the source of your
          strength. When you arise in the morning, gather all the members of your household together, as did Abraham,
          and invite them to seek God with you. If your business presses strongly, and urges you to your work, then
          there is still greater need to take time to pray, to present your petitions to the throne of grace, and secure
          the protecting care, the aid, the mercy and blessing of God. Do not grudge the time that God requires, and
          hurry through a faithless, formal prayer, that you may rush to your business.</p>
      <p>God can do much for you, even in your labor, if you ask Him. He can send His angels to preserve you from
          accidents, from breakage, and losses of life and property. The reason why those who neglect the privileges
          that God has provided have no more comfort and peace and joy is that they do not pause to have communion with
          God, who is the source of their strength. Can God pour out His Spirit, can He bless us, where there is so much
          indifference to His service? He cannot give us His rich blessing without our cooperation in His plans. He
          says, “Them that honour me I will honour.”</p>
      <p>It is just as convenient, just as essential, for us to pray three times a day as it was for Daniel. Prayer is
          the life of the soul, the foundation of spiritual growth. In your home, before your family, and before your
          workmen, you should testify to this truth. And when you are privileged to meet with your brethren in the
          church, tell them of the necessity of keeping open the channel of communication between God and the soul. Tell
          them that if they will ﬁnd heart and voice to pray, God will ﬁnd answers to their prayers. Tell them not to
          neglect their religious duties. Exhort the brethren to pray. We must seek if we would ﬁnd, we must ask if we
          would receive, we must knock if we would have the door opened unto us.</p>
      <p>If there are only a few assembled, there are enough to claim the precious promises of God. The Father, the Son,
          and the holy angels will be present with you to behold your faith, your steadfast principle, and there you
          will have of the outpouring of God’s Holy Spirit. God has rich blessings in store for those who will bring not
          only all the tithes into His storehouse, but also time and strength of bone and brain and muscle into His
          <nobr>service.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, February 10, 1890.</p>
