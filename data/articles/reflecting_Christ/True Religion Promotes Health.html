    <h1>True Religion Promotes Health</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>[Wisdom’s] ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. Proverbs 3:17.</strong></p>
      <p>This world is not all sorrow and misery. “God is love” is written upon every opening bud, upon the petals of
          every ﬂower, and upon every spire of grass. Though the curse of sin has caused the earth to bring forth thorns
          and thistles, there are ﬂowers upon the thistles and the thorns are hidden by roses. All things in nature
          testify to the tender, fatherly care of our God and to His desire to make His children happy. His prohibitions
          and injunctions are not intended merely to display His authority, but in all that He does He has the
          <nobr>well-being</nobr> of His children in view. He does not require them to give up anything that it would be
          for their best interest to retain.</p>
      <p>The opinion which prevails in some classes of society, that religion is not conducive to health or to happiness
          in this life, is one of the most mischievous of errors. The Scripture says: “The fear of the Lord tendeth to
          life: and he that hath it shall abide satisﬁed” (Proverbs 19:23). “What man is he that desireth life, and
          loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart
          from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it” (Psalm <nobr>34:12-14).</nobr> The words of wisdom “are
          life unto those that ﬁnd them, and health to all their ﬂesh” (Proverbs 4:22).</p>
      <p>True religion brings man into harmony with the laws of God, physical, mental, and moral. It teaches
          <nobr>self-control,</nobr> serenity, temperance. Religion ennobles the mind, reﬁnes the taste, and sanctiﬁes
          the judgment. It makes the soul a partaker of the purity of heaven. Faith in God’s love and overruling
          providence lightens the burdens of anxiety and care. It ﬁlls the heart with joy and contentment in the highest
          or the lowliest lot. Religion tends directly to promote health, to lengthen life, and to heighten our
          enjoyment of all its blessings. It opens to the soul a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> fountain of happiness. Would
          that all who have not chosen Christ might realize that He has something vastly better to offer them than they
          are seeking for themselves....</p>
      <p>There is an intimate relation between the mind and the body, and in order to reach a high standard of moral and
          intellectual attainment the laws that control our physical being must be heeded. To secure a strong,
          <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> character, both the mental and the physical powers must be exercised and developed.
          What study can be more important ... than that which treats of this wonderful organism that God has committed
          to us, and of the laws by which it may be preserved in <nobr>health?—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 600,
          601.</p>
