    <h1>Christ was No Respecter of Persons</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons. Acts
          10:34.</strong></p>
      <p>The religion of Christ uplifts the receiver to a higher plane of thought and action, while at the same time it
          presents the whole human race as alike the objects of the love of God, being purchased by the sacriﬁce of His
          Son. At the feet of Jesus, the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, meet together, with no thought
          of caste or worldly preeminence. All earthly distinctions are forgotten as we look upon Him whom our sins have
          pierced. The <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> the condescension, the inﬁnite compassion of Him who was highly exalted
          in heaven, puts to shame human pride, <nobr>self-esteem,</nobr> and social caste. Pure, undeﬁled religion
          manifests its <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> principles in bringing into oneness all who are sanctiﬁed through the
          truth. All meet as <nobr>blood-bought</nobr> souls, alike dependent upon Him who has redeemed them to
          God.</p>
      <p>The Lord has lent men talents to improve, Those whom He has entrusted with money are to bring their talent of
          means to the Master. Men and women of inﬂuence are to use that which God has given them. The ones whom He has
          endowed with wisdom are to bring to the cross of Christ this gift to be used to His glory.</p>
      <p>And the poor have their talent, which perhaps may be larger than any other mentioned. It may be simplicity of
          character, humility, tried virtue, conﬁdence in God. Through patient toil, through their entire dependence
          upon God, they are pointing those with whom they associate to Jesus, their Redeemer. They have a heart full of
          sympathy for the poor, a home for the needy and oppressed, and their testimony is clear and decided as to what
          Jesus is to them. They seek for glory, honor, and immortality, and their reward will be eternal life.</p>
      <p>In the human brotherhood it takes all kinds of talents to make a perfect whole; and the church of Christ is
          composed of men and women of varied talents, and of all ranks and all classes. God never designed that the
          pride of men should dissolve that which His own wisdom had <nobr>ordained—the</nobr> combination of all
          classes of minds, of all the varied talents that make a complete whole. There should be no depreciating of any
          part of God’s great work, whether the agencies are high or lowly. All have their part to act in diffusing
          light in different degrees.... We are all woven together in the great web of humanity, and we cannot,</p>
      <p>without loss, withdraw our sympathies from one <nobr>another.—Gospel</nobr> Workers, 330, 331.</p>
