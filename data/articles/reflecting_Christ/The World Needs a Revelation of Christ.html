    <h1>The World Needs a Revelation of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
          perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. Philippians 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>We are living in the midst of an ‘epidemic of crime,’ at which thoughtful, <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> men
          everywhere stand aghast. The corruption that prevails, it is beyond the power of the human pen to describe.
          Every day brings fresh revelations of political strife, bribery, and fraud. Every day brings its
          <nobr>heart-sickening</nobr> record of violence and lawlessness, of indifference to human suffering, of
          brutal, ﬁendish destruction of human life. Every day testiﬁes to the increase of insanity, murder, and
          suicide. Who can doubt that satanic agencies are at work among men with increasing activity to distract and
          corrupt the mind, and deﬁle and destroy the body?</p>
      <p>And while the world is ﬁlled with these evils, the gospel is too often presented in so indifferent a manner as
          to make but little impression upon the consciences or the lives of men. Everywhere there are hearts crying out
          for something which they have not. They long for a power that will give them mastery over sin, a power that
          will deliver them from the bondage of evil, a power that will give health and life and peace. Many who once
          knew the power of God’s Word have dwelt where there is no recognition of God, and they long for the divine
          presence.</p>
      <p>The world needs today what it needed nineteen hundred years <nobr>ago—a</nobr> revelation of Christ. A great
          work of reform is demanded, and it is only through the grace of Christ that the work of restoration, physical,
          mental, and spiritual, can be <nobr>accomplished.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, 142, 143.</p>
      <p>To everyone who becomes a partaker of His grace the Lord appoints a work for others. Individually we are to
          stand in our lot and place, saying, “Here am I; send me” (Isaiah 6:8). Upon the minister of the Word, the
          missionary nurse, the Christian physician, the individual Christian whether he be merchant or farmer,
          professional man or <nobr>mechanic—the</nobr> responsibility rests upon all. It is our work to reveal to men
          the gospel of their salvation. Every enterprise in which we engage should be a means to this end....</p>
      <p>Let all cultivate their physical and mental powers to the utmost of their ability, that they may work for God
          where His providence shall call them. The same grace that came from Christ to Paul and Apollos, that
          distinguished them for their spiritual excellencies, will today be imparted to devoted Christian missionaries.
          God desires His children to have intelligence and knowledge, that with unmistakable clearness and power His
          glory may be revealed in our <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, 148, 149.</p>
