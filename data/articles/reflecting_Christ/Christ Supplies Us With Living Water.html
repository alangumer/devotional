    <h1>Christ Supplies Us With Living Water</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “If a man is thirsty,
          let him come to me, and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will
          ﬂow from within him.” John 7:37, 38, N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The priest ... performed the ceremony which commemorated the smiting of the rock in the wilderness. That rock
          was a symbol of Him who by His death would cause living streams of salvation to ﬂow to all who are athirst.
          Christ’s words were the water of life. There in the presence of the assembled multitude He set Himself apart
          to be smitten, that the water of life might ﬂow to the world. In smiting Christ, Satan thought to destroy the
          Prince of life; but from the smitten rock there ﬂowed living water. As Jesus thus spoke to the people, their
          hearts thrilled with a strange awe, and many were ready to exclaim, with the woman of Samaria, “Give me this
          water, that I thirst not” (John 4:15).</p>
      <p>Jesus knew the wants of the soul. Pomp, riches, and honor cannot satisfy the heart. “If any man thirst, let him
          come unto me.” The rich, the poor, the high, the low, are alike welcome. He promises to relieve the burdened
          mind, to comfort the sorrowing, and to give hope to the despondent. Many of those who heard Jesus were
          mourners over disappointed hopes, many were nourishing a secret grief, many were seeking to satisfy their
          restless longing with the things of the world and the praise of men; but when all was gained, they found that
          they had toiled only to reach a broken cistern, from which they could not quench their thirst. Amid the
          glitter of the joyous scene they stood, dissatisﬁed and sad. That sudden cry, “If any man thirst,” startled
          them from their sorrowful meditation, and as they listened to the words that followed, their minds kindled
          with a new hope. The Holy Spirit presented the symbol before them until they saw in it the offer of the
          priceless gift of salvation.</p>
      <p>The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and it appeals to us with even greater power than
          to those who heard it in the temple on the last day of the feast. The fountain is open for all. The weary and
          exhausted ones are offered the refreshing draught of eternal life. Jesus is still crying, “If any man thirst,
          let him come unto me, and drink.” “Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of
          life freely” (Revelation 22:17). “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst;
          but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John
          <nobr>4:14).—The</nobr> Desire of Ages, 454.</p>
