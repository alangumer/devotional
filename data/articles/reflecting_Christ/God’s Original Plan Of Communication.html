      <p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
      <p>And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. Genesis 3:8.</p>
      <p>In a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real development have their source. Wherever we turn, in the
          physical, the mental, or the spiritual realm; in whatever we behold, apart from the blight of sin, this
          knowledge is revealed. Whatever line of investigation we pursue, with a sincere purpose to arrive at truth, we
          are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty Intelligence that is working in and through all. The mind of man
          is brought into communion with the mind of God, the ﬁnite with the Inﬁnite. The effect of such communion on
          body and mind and soul is beyond estimate.</p>
      <p>In this communion is found the highest education. It is God’s own method of development. “Acquaint now thyself
          with him” is His message to mankind. The method outlined in these words was the method followed in the
          education of the father of our race. When in the glory of sinless manhood Adam stood in holy Eden, it was thus
          that God instructed him....</p>
      <p>When Adam came from the Creator’s hand, he bore, in his physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to
          his Maker. “God created man in his own image” (Genesis 1:27), and it was His purpose that the longer man lived
          the more fully he should reveal this <nobr>image—the</nobr> more fully reﬂect the glory of the Creator. All
          his faculties were capable of development; their capacity and vigor were continually to increase. Vast was the
          scope offered for their exercise, glorious the ﬁeld opened to their research....
          <nobr>Face-to-face,</nobr><nobr>heart-to-heart</nobr></p>
      <p>communion with his Maker was his high privilege. Had he remained loyal to God, all this would have been his
          forever.... More and more fully would he have fulﬁlled the object of</p>
      <p>his creation, more and more fully have reﬂected the Creator’s <nobr>glory.—Education,</nobr> 14, 15. The laws
          and operations of nature, and the great principles of truth that govern the</p>
      <p>spiritual universe, were opened to their minds by the inﬁnite Author of all. In “the light of the knowledge of
          the glory of God” (2 Corinthians 4:6), their mental and spiritual powers developed, and they realized the
          highest pleasures of their holy existence....</p>
      <p>The Garden of Eden was a representation of what God desired the whole earth to become, and it was His purpose
          that, as the human family increased in numbers, they should establish other homes and schools like the one He
          had given. Thus in course of time the whole earth might be occupied with homes and schools where the words and
          the works of God should be studied, and where the students should thus be ﬁtted more and more fully to reﬂect,
          throughout endless ages, the light of the knowledge of His <nobr>glory.—Education,</nobr> 22.</p>
