      <p><strong>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
          bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. 2 Corinthians 10:5.</strong></p>
      <p>More precious than the golden wedge of Ophir is the power of right thought. We need to place a high value upon
          the right control of our thoughts; for such control prepares us to labor for the Master. It is necessary for
          our peace and happiness in this life that our thoughts center in Christ. As a man thinketh, so is he.</p>
      <p>The merciful shall ﬁnd mercy, and the pure in heart shall see God. Every impure thought deﬁles the soul,
          impairs the moral sense, and tends to obliterate the impressions of the Holy Spirit. It dims the spiritual
          vision, so that men cannot behold God. The Lord may and does forgive the repenting sinner; but though
          forgiven, the soul is marred. All impurity of speech and thought must be shunned by him who would have clear
          discernment of spiritual truth.</p>
      <p>Evil thoughts destroy the soul. The converting power of God changes the heart, reﬁning and purifying the
          thoughts. Unless a determined effort is made to keep the thoughts centered on Christ, grace cannot reveal
          itself in the life. The mind must engage in the spiritual warfare. Every thought must be brought into
          captivity to the obedience of Christ. All the habits must be brought under God’s control.</p>
      <p>We need a constant sense of the ennobling power of pure thoughts and the damaging inﬂuence of evil thoughts.
          Let us place our thoughts upon holy things. Let them be pure and true; for the only security for any soul is
          right thinking. We are to use every means that God has placed within our reach for the government and
          cultivation of our thoughts. We are to bring our minds into harmony with Christ’s mind. His truth will
          sanctify us, body, soul, and spirit, and we shall be enabled to rise above temptation.</p>
      <p>“The prince of this world cometh,” said Jesus, “and hath nothing in me.” There was in Him nothing that
          responded to Satan’s sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation.
          So may it be with us. Christ’s humanity was united with divinity; He was ﬁtted for the conﬂict by the
          indwelling of the Holy Spirit.... So long</p>
      <p>as we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to
          direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfection of character....
          Every promise in God’s Word is ours.</p>
      <p>“By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” are we to live.... Look not to</p>
      <p>circumstances or to the weakness of self, but to the power of the Word. All its strength is
          <nobr>yours.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 23, 1905.</p>
