    <h1>Sanctiﬁcation Is The Result Of Lifelong Obedience</h1>

      <p><strong>He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 1 John
          2:6.</strong></p>
      <p>John was a teacher of holiness, and in his letters to the church he laid down unerring rules for the conduct of
          Christians. “Every man that hath this hope in him,” he wrote, “puriﬁeth himself, even as he is pure” (1 John
          3:3).... He taught that the Christian must be</p>
      <p>pure in heart and life. Never should he be satisﬁed with an empty profession. As God is holy in His sphere, so
          fallen man, through faith in Christ, is to be holy in his sphere....</p>
      <p>The sanctiﬁcation of the church is God’s object in all His dealings with His people. He has chosen them from
          eternity, that they might be holy. He gave His Son to die for them, that they might be sanctiﬁed through
          obedience to the truth, divested of all the littleness of self. From them He requires a personal work, a
          personal surrender. God can be honored by those who profess to believe in Him, only as they are conformed to
          His image and controlled by His Spirit. Then, as witnesses for the Saviour, they may make known what divine
          grace has done for them.</p>
      <p>True sanctiﬁcation comes through the working out of the principle of love. “God is love; and he that dwelleth
          in love dwelleth in God, and God in him” (chap. 4:16). The life of him in whose heart Christ abides, will
          reveal practical godliness. The character will be puriﬁed, elevated, ennobled, and gloriﬁed. Pure doctrine
          will blend with works of righteousness; heavenly precepts will mingle with holy practices....</p>
      <p>It is the fragrance of our love for our fellow men that reveals our love for God. It is patience in service
          that brings rest to the soul. It is through humble, diligent, faithful toil that the welfare of Israel is
          promoted. God upholds and strengthens the one who is willing to follow in Christ’s way.</p>
      <p>[Sanctiﬁcation] is not gained by a happy ﬂight of feeling, but is the result of constantly dying to sin, and
          constantly living for Christ. Wrongs cannot be righted nor reformations wrought in the character by feeble,
          intermittent efforts. It is only by long, persevering effort, sore discipline, and stern conﬂict, that we
          shall overcome. We know not one day how strong will be our conﬂict the next. So long as Satan reigns, we shall
          have self to subdue, besetting sins to overcome; so long as life shall last, there will be no stopping place,
          no point which we can reach and say, I have fully attained. Sanctiﬁcation is the result of lifelong
          <nobr>obedience.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>559-561.</nobr></p>
