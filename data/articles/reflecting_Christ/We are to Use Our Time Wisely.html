    <h1>We are to Use Our Time Wisely</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ... not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord. Romans 12:10,</strong></p>
      <p>11.</p>
      <p>The talent of time is precious. Every day it is given to us in trust, and we shall be called upon to give an
          account of it to God. It is to be used to God’s glory, and if we would prolong our lives, if we would gain the
          life that measures with the life of God, we must give the mind pure food. No time should be wasted that might
          have been used to good account.</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ is our spiritual touchstone. He reveals the Father. Nothing should be given as food to the brain
          that will bring before the mind any mist or cloud in regard to the Word of God. No careless inattention should
          be shown in regard to the cultivation of the soil of the heart. <nobr>—Manuscript</nobr> 15, 1898.</p>
      <p>Upon the right improvement of our time depends our success in acquiring knowledge and mental culture. The
          cultivation of the intellect need not be prevented by poverty, humble origin, or unfavorable surroundings.
          Only let the moments be treasured. A few moments here and a few there, that might be frittered away in aimless
          talk; the morning hours so often wasted in bed; the time spent in traveling on the trams or railway cars, or
          waiting at the station; the moments of waiting for meals, waiting for those who are tardy in keeping an
          <nobr>appointment—if</nobr> a book were kept at hand, and these fragments of time were improved in study,
          reading, or careful thought, what might not be accomplished. A resolute purpose, persistent industry, and
          careful economy of time will enable men to acquire knowledge and mental discipline which will qualify them for
          almost any position of inﬂuence and usefulness.</p>
      <p>It is the duty of every Christian to acquire habits of order, thoroughness, and dispatch....</p>
      <p>Decide how long a time is required for a given task, and then bend every effort toward accomplishing the work
          in the given time. The exercise of the willpower will make the hands move <nobr>deftly.—Christ’s</nobr> Object
          Lessons, 343 344.</p>
      <p>It is wrong to waste our time, wrong to waste our thoughts. We lose every moment that we devote to
          <nobr>self-seeking.</nobr> If every moment were valued and rightly employed, we should have time for
          everything that we need to do for ourselves or for the world. In the expenditure of money, in the use of time,
          strength, opportunities, let every Christian look to God for <nobr>guidance.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing,
          208.</p>
      <p>God grants men the gift of time for the purpose of promoting His <nobr>glory.—Counsels</nobr> to Parents and
          Teachers, p. 354.</p>
