    <h1>The Relationship Between Flesh and Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For he that soweth to his ﬂesh shall of the ﬂesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit
          shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. Galatians 6:8.</strong></p>
      <p>The lower passions have their seat in the body and work through it. The words “ﬂesh” or “ﬂeshly” or “carnal
          lusts” embrace the lower, corrupt nature; the ﬂesh of itself cannot act contrary to the will of God. We are
          commanded to crucify the ﬂesh, with the affections and lusts. How shall we do it? Shall we inﬂict pain on the
          body? No; but put to death the temptation to sin. The corrupt thought is to be expelled. Every thought is to
          be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. All animal propensities are to be subjected to the higher powers of
          the soul. The love of God must reign supreme; Christ must occupy an undivided throne. Our bodies are to be
          regarded as His purchased possession. The members of the body are to become the instruments of
          <nobr>righteousness.—The</nobr> Adventist Home, 127, 128.</p>
      <p>A strict compliance with the requirements of God is beneﬁcial to the health of body and mind. In order to reach
          the highest standard of moral and intellectual attainments, it is necessary to seek wisdom and strength from
          God, and to observe strict temperance in all the habits of life. In the experience of Daniel and his
          companions we have an instance of the triumph of principle over temptation to indulge the appetite. It shows
          us that through religious principle young men may triumph over the lusts of the ﬂesh, and remain true to God’s
          requirements, even though it cost them a great sacriﬁce....</p>
      <p>We should consider the words of the apostle in which he appeals to his brethren, by the mercies of God, to
          present their bodies “a living sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto God.” This is true sanctiﬁcation. It is not
          merely a theory, an emotion, or a form of words, but a living, active principle, entering into the everyday
          life. It requires that our habits of eating, drinking, and dressing be such as to secure the preservation of
          physical, mental, and moral health, that we may present to the Lord our <nobr>bodies—not</nobr> an offering
          corrupted by wrong habits, <nobr>but—“a</nobr> living sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto God.”...</p>
      <p>A close sympathy exists between the physical and the moral nature.... Wherever they</p>
      <p>may be, those who are truly sanctiﬁed will elevate the moral standard by preserving correct physical habits,
          and, like Daniel, presenting to others an example of temperance and <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> Every depraved
          appetite becomes a warring lust. Everything that conﬂicts with natural law creates a diseased condition of the
          soul....</p>
      <p>With what care should Christians regulate their habits, that they may preserve the full vigor of every faculty
          to give to the service of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 25, 1881.</p>
