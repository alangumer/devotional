      <p><strong>In all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times
          better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. Daniel 1:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Why did Daniel and his companions refuse to eat at the king’s table? Why did they refuse his meats and wines?
          Because they had been taught that this class of food would not keep the mind or the physical structure in the
          very best condition of health to do God’s service. These youth urged most earnestly that the one who had
          charge of their food should not compel them to partake of the king’s luxuries, or drink of his wine. They
          begged him to try them ten days only, and then examine them, and decide by their physical appearance whether
          their abstemious diet would be to their disadvantage. When they came in for examination, the result was
          decidedly in their favor.</p>
      <p>It was otherwise with the youth who had eaten of the luxuries of the king’s table, and drank of his wine. The
          clear sparkle of the eye was gone; the ruddy, healthful glow had disappeared from the countenance. The four
          Hebrew captives were thereafter permitted to have the diet they had chosen. What effect did it have upon mind
          and character? They had conscientiously refused the stimulus of ﬂesh and of wine. They obeyed God’s will in
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and He showed His approval. He desired His servants to honor Him by their adherence
          to steadfast principle in all their habits of life. Their countenances would be a certiﬁcate of physical
          soundness and moral purity.</p>
      <p>“And as for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had
          understanding in all visions and dreams.” These youth had the Lord as their educator. The golden links of the
          chain of heaven connected the ﬁnite with the inﬁnite. They were partakers of the divine nature. They were very
          careful to keep themselves in touch with God. They prayed and studied and brought into their practical life
          strictly conscientious, humble minds.... The word of the Lord was their meat and their</p>
      <p>drink. “And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times
          better than all the magicians and astrologers.” ...</p>
      <p>When the children of faith shall with earnest prayer dedicate themselves to God without reserve, the Lord will
          honor their faith, and will bless them with a clear mind....</p>
      <p>The very ﬂesh in which the soul tabernacles, and through which it works, is the Lord’s. We have no right to
          neglect any part of the living machinery. Every portion of the living organism is the Lord’s. The knowledge of
          our own physical organism should teach us that every member is to do God’s service, as an instrument of
          righteousness.— Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 9, pp. <nobr>60-62.</nobr></p>
