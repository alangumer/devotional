    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be
          brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:13.</strong></p>
      <p>A storm is coming, relentless in its fury. Are we prepared to meet it?</p>
      <p>We need not say: The perils of the last days are soon to come upon us. Already they have come. We need now the
          sword of the Lord to cut to the very soul and marrow of ﬂeshly lusts, appetites, and passions.</p>
      <p>Minds that have been given up to loose thought need to change. “Girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and
          set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as
          children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance:
          but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; because it is
          written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy” (1 Peter <nobr>1:13-16,</nobr> A.R.V.). The thoughts must be
          centered upon God. Now is the time to put forth earnest effort to overcome the natural tendencies of the
          carnal heart.</p>
      <p>Our efforts, our <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> our perseverance, must be proportionate to the inﬁnite value of the
          object of which we are in pursuit. Only by overcoming as Christ overcame shall we win the crown of life.</p>
      <p>Man’s great danger is in being <nobr>self-deceived,</nobr> indulging <nobr>self-sufﬁciency,</nobr> and thus
          separating from God, the source of his strength. Our natural tendencies, unless corrected by the Holy Spirit
          of God, have in them the seeds of moral death....</p>
      <p>In order to receive help from Christ, we must realize our need. We must have a true knowledge of ourselves. It
          is only he who knows himself to be a sinner that Christ can save. Only as we see our utter helplessness and
          renounce all <nobr>self-trust,</nobr> shall we lay hold on divine power.</p>
      <p>It is not only at the beginning of the Christian life that this renunciation of self is to be made. At every
          advance step heavenward it is to be renewed. All our good works are dependent on a power outside of ourselves;
          therefore there needs to be a continual reaching out of the heart after God, a constant, earnest confession of
          sin and humbling of the soul before Him. Perils surround us; and we are safe only as we feel our weakness and
          cling with the grasp of faith to our mighty Deliverer....</p>
      <p>“Every word of God is pure: He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him” (Proverbs
          <nobr>30:5).—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 8:315, 316.</p>
