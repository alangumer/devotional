    <h1>How We May Keep God’s Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. Psalm
          111:3.</strong></p>
      <p>One ray of the glory of God, one gleam of the purity of Christ, penetrating the soul, makes every spot of
          deﬁlement painfully distinct, and lays bare the deformity and defects of the human character. How can anyone
          who is brought before the holy standard of God’s law, which makes apparent the evil motives, the unhallowed
          desires, the inﬁdelity of the heart, the impurity of the lips, and that lays bare the life, make any boast of
          holiness? His acts of disloyalty in making void the law of God are exposed to his sight, and his spirit is
          stricken and afﬂicted under the searching inﬂuences of the Spirit of God. He loathes himself as he views the
          greatness, the majesty, the pure and spotless character of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>When the Spirit of Christ stirs the heart with its marvelous awakening power, there is a sense of deﬁciency in
          the soul, that leads to contrition of mind, and humiliation of self, rather than to proud boasting of what has
          been acquired. When Daniel beheld the glory and majesty surrounding the heavenly messenger that was sent unto
          him, he exclaimed, as he described the wonderful scene, “Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great
          vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I
          retained no strength.”</p>
      <p>The soul that is thus touched will never wrap itself about with <nobr>self-righteousness,</nobr> or a
          pretentious garb of holiness; but will hate its selﬁshness, abhor its <nobr>self-love,</nobr> and will seek,
          through Christ’s righteousness, for that purity of heart which is in harmony with the law of God and the
          character of Christ. He will then reﬂect the character of Christ, the hope of glory. It will be the greatest
          mystery to him that Jesus should have made so great a sacriﬁce to redeem him.</p>
      <p>He will exclaim, with humble mien and quivering lip, “He loved me. He gave Himself for me. He became poor that
          I, through His poverty, might be made rich. The Man of Sorrows did not spurn me, but poured out His
          inexhaustible, redeeming love that my heart might be made clean; and He has brought me back into loyalty and
          obedience to all His commandments. His condescension, His humiliation, His cruciﬁxion, are the crowning
          miracles in the marvelous exhibition of the plan of salvation.... All this He has done to</p>
      <p>make it possible to impart to me His own righteousness, that I may keep the law I have transgressed. For this I
          adore Him. I will proclaim Him to all <nobr>sinners.”—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 16, 1888.</p>
