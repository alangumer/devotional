    <h1>Family United by Bonds of Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. Proverbs
          31:26.</strong></p>
      <p>Whenever the mother can speak a word of commendation for the good conduct of her children, she should do so.
          She should encourage them by words of approval and looks of love. These will be as sunshine to the heart of a
          child and will lead to the cultivation of <nobr>self-respect</nobr> and pride of character....</p>
      <p>Children have sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased and easily made unhappy. By gentle discipline
          in loving words and acts, mothers may bind their children to their hearts. To manifest severity and to be
          exacting with children are great mistakes. Uniform ﬁrmness and unimpassioned control are necessary to the
          discipline of every family. Say what you mean calmly, move with consideration, and carry out what you say
          without deviation.</p>
      <p>It will pay to manifest affection in your association with your children. Do not repel them by lack of sympathy
          in their childish sports, joys, and <nobr>griefs.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 3:532.</p>
      <p>Infant children are a mirror for the mother, in which she may see reﬂected her own habits and deportment, and
          may trace even the tones of her own voice. How careful then should be her language and behavior in the
          presence of these little learners who take her for an example. If she wishes them to be gentle in manners and
          tractable, she must cultivate those traits in herself.</p>
      <p>When children love and repose conﬁdence in their mother, and have become obedient to her, they have been taught
          the ﬁrst lessons in becoming Christians....</p>
      <p>In view of the individual responsibility of mothers, every woman should develop a <nobr>well-balanced</nobr>
          mind and pure character, reﬂecting only the true, the good, and the beautiful. The wife and mother may bind
          her husband and children to her heart by an unremitting love, shown in gentle words and courteous deportment,
          which, as a rule, will be copied by her children.</p>
      <p>Politeness is cheap, but it has power to soften natures which would grow hard and rough without it. Christian
          politeness should reign in every household. The cultivation of a uniform courtesy, and a willingness to do by
          others as we would like them to do by us, would annihilate half the ills of life. The principle inculcated in
          the injunction, “Be kindly affectioned one to another,” is the cornerstone of the Christian character....
          Christian</p>
      <p>courtesy is the golden clasp which unites the members of the family in bonds of love, becoming closer and
          stronger every <nobr>day.—The</nobr> Health Reformer, August, 1877.</p>
