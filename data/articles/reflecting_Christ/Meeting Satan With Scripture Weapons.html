    <h1>Meeting Satan With Scripture Weapons</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. Psalm 119:11. It is the ﬁrst and
          highest duty of every rational being to learn from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light
          and encourage others to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible diligently, weighing every
          thought and comparing scripture with scripture. With divine help we are to form our opinions for ourselves as
          we are to answer</strong></p>
      <p>for ourselves before God....</p>
      <p>An understanding of Bible truth depends not so much on the power of intellect brought to the search as on the
          singleness of purpose, the earnest longing after righteousness.</p>
      <p>The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of
          those things easy to be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difﬁcult of comprehension. It is the
          ofﬁce of heavenly angels to prepare the heart so to comprehend God’s Word that we shall be charmed with its
          beauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and strengthened by its promises. We should make the
          psalmist’s petition our own. “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law” (Psalm
          119:18).</p>
      <p>Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the
          tempted one cannot readily remember God’s promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are
          round about those who are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great necessity they will
          bring to their remembrance the very truths which are needed. Thus “when the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood,
          the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him” (Isaiah 59:19).</p>
      <p>Jesus promised His disciples: “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he
          shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you” (John
          14:26). But the teachings of Christ must previously have been stored in the mind in order for the Spirit of
          God to bring them to our remembrance in the time of peril....</p>
      <p>We are living in the most solemn period of this world’s history. The destiny of earth’s teeming multitudes is
          about to be decided. Our own future <nobr>well-being</nobr> and also the salvation of other souls depend upon
          the course which we now pursue. We need to be guided by the Spirit of truth.... We should now seek a deep and
          living experience in the things of God. We</p>
      <p>have not a moment to lose. Events of vital importance are taking place around us. We are on Satan’s enchanted
          ground. Sleep <nobr>not.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, <nobr>598-601.</nobr></p>
