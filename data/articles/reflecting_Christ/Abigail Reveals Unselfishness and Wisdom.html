    <h1>Abigail Reveals Unselﬁshness and Wisdom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When Abigail saw David, she hasted, and ... fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the
          ground, and fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be. 1 Samuel 25:23,
          24.</strong></p>
      <p>David and his men ... protected from the ... marauders the ﬂocks and herds of a very wealthy man named Nabal,
          who had vast possessions in Carmel. Nabal was a descendant of Caleb, but his character was churlish and
          niggardly.</p>
      <p>David and his men were in sore need of provisions while at this place, and when the son of Jesse heard that
          Nabal was shearing his sheep he sent out ten young men, “and David said unto the young men, Get you up to
          Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.” ...</p>
      <p>David and his men had been like a wall of protection to the shepherds and ﬂocks of Nabal as they pastured in
          the mountains. And he courteously petitioned that supplies be given them in their great need from the
          abundance of this rich man.... “And Nabal answered</p>
      <p>David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? ... Shall I then take my bread, and my
          water, and my ﬂesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they
          be?”</p>
      <p>When the young men returned <nobr>empty-handed,</nobr> disappointed, and disgusted, and related the affair to
          David, he was ﬁlled with indignation.... David commanded his men to gird on</p>
      <p>their swords, and equip themselves for an encounter....</p>
      <p>One of the servants of Nabal hastened to Abigail, the wife of Nabal, ... and told her what had
          happened....</p>
      <p>Without consulting her husband, or telling him of her intention, Abigail made up an ample supply of provisions,
          and started out to meet the army of David. She met them in a covert of a hill. “And when Abigail saw David,
          she hasted, and ... fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and fell at his feet, and
          said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine
          audience.” Abigail addressed David with as much reverence as though speaking to a crowned monarch....
          With</p>
      <p>kind words she sought to soothe his irritated feelings.... With utter unselﬁshness of spirit,</p>
      <p>she desired him to impute the whole blame of the matter to her, and not to charge it to her poor, deluded
          husband....</p>
      <p>What a spirit is this! With nothing of ostentation or pride, but full of the wisdom and love of God, Abigail
          revealed the strength of her devotion to her household. Whatever was her husband’s disposition, he was her
          husband still, and she made it plain to the indignant captain that the unkind course of her husband was in
          nowise premeditated against him as a personal <nobr>affront.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, October 26,
          1888.</p>
