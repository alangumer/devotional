    <h1>Acquiring the Divine Beauty of Meekness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek
          meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger. Zephaniah 2:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who have felt their need of Christ, those who have mourned because of sin and have sat with Christ in the
          school of afﬂiction, will learn meekness from the divine Teacher....</p>
      <p>The statement made by Moses under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that he was the meekest man upon the
          earth, would not have been regarded by the people of his time as a commendation; it would rather have excited
          pity or contempt. But Jesus places meekness among the ﬁrst qualiﬁcations for His kingdom. In His own life and
          character the divine beauty of this precious grace is revealed....</p>
      <p>Through all the lowly experiences of life He consented to pass, walking among the children of men, not as a
          king, to demand homage, but as one whose mission it was to serve others. There was in His manner no taint of
          bigotry, no cold austerity. The world’s Redeemer had a greater than angelic nature, yet united with His divine
          majesty were meekness and humility that attracted all to Himself.</p>
      <p>Jesus emptied Himself, and in all that He did, self did not appear. He subordinated all things to the will of
          His Father. When His mission on earth was about to close, He could say, “I have gloriﬁed thee on the earth: I
          have ﬁnished the work which thou gavest me to do” (John 17:4)....</p>
      <p>It is the love of self that destroys our peace. While self is all alive, we stand ready continually to guard it
          from mortiﬁcation and insult; but when we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall not take
          neglects or slights to heart. We shall be deaf to reproach and blind to scorn and insult. “Love suffereth long
          and is kind” (1 Corinthians 13:4, R.V.)....</p>
      <p>Happiness drawn from earthly sources is as changeable as varying circumstances can make it; but the peace of
          Christ is a constant and abiding peace. It does not depend upon any circumstances in life, on the amount of
          worldly goods or the number of earthly friends. Christ is the fountain of living water, and happiness drawn
          from Him can never fail.</p>
      <p>The meekness of Christ, manifested in the home, will make the inmates happy; it provokes no quarrel, gives back
          no angry answer, but soothes the irritated temper and diffuses a gentleness that is felt by all within its
          charmed circle. Wherever cherished, it makes the families of earth a part of the one great family
          <nobr>above.—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, <nobr>13-17.</nobr></p>
