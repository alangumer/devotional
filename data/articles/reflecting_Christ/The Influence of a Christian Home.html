    <h1>The Inﬂuence of a Christian Home</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. John
          8:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Our time, our strength, and our energies belong to God; and if they are consecrated to His service, our light
          will shine. It will affect ﬁrst and most strongly those in our own homes, who are most intimately associated
          with us; but it will extend beyond the home, even to “the world.” To many it will be a savor of life unto
          life; but there are some who will refuse to see the light, or to walk in it. They are of that class spoken of
          by our Saviour, when He said: “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
          darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.” Such are in a very dangerous position; but their
          course does not excuse any of us from letting our light shine.</p>
      <p>Suppose that because some ship had disregarded his warning beacon, and gone to pieces on the rocks, the
          lighthouse keeper should put out his lights, and say, “I will pay no more attention to the lighthouse”; what
          would be the consequence? But that is not the way he does. He keeps his lights burning all night, throwing
          their beams far out into the darkness, for the beneﬁt of every mariner that comes within the dangerous reach
          of rocks and shoals. Were some ship to be wrecked because the lights went out, it would be telegraphed over
          the world that on such a night, at such a point, a ship went to pieces on the rocks because there was no light
          in the tower. But if some ships are wrecked because they pay no attention to the light, the lighthouse keeper
          is guiltless; they were warned, but they paid no heed.</p>
      <p>What if the light in the household should go out? Then everyone in that house would be in darkness; and the
          result would be as disastrous as though the light were to go out in the lighthouse tower. Souls are looking at
          you, fellow Christians, to see whether you are drunken with the cares of this life, or are preparing for the
          future, immortal life. They will watch to see what the inﬂuence of your life is, and whether you are true
          missionaries at home, training your children for heaven.</p>
      <p>The Christian’s ﬁrst duty is in the home. Fathers and mothers, yours is a great responsibility. You are
          preparing your children for life or for death; you are training them for an abiding place here in the earth,
          for <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation</nobr> in this life, or for the immortal life, to praise God forever. And which
          shall it be? It should be the burden of your life to have every child that God has committed to your trust
          receive the divine mold. <nobr>—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, January 14, 1886.</p>
