    <h1>The Essential Qualiﬁcation for Service</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yea,
          Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. John 21:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Little mention is made in the book of Acts of the later work of the apostle Peter.... As the</p>
      <p>number of believers multiplied in Jerusalem and in other places visited by the messengers of the cross, the
          talents possessed by Peter proved of untold value to the early Christian church. The inﬂuence of his testimony
          concerning Jesus of Nazareth extended far and wide. Upon him had been laid a double responsibility. He bore
          positive witness concerning the Messiah before unbelievers, laboring earnestly for their conversion; and at
          the same time he did a special work for believers, strengthening them in the faith of Christ.</p>
      <p>It was after Peter had been led to <nobr>self-renunciation</nobr> and entire reliance upon divine power, that
          he received his call to act as an undershepherd. Christ had said to Peter, before his denial of Him, “When
          thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren” (Luke 22:32). These words were signiﬁcant of the wide and
          effectual work which this apostle was to do in the future for those who should come to the faith.</p>
      <p>For this work, Peter’s own experience of sin and suffering and repentance had prepared him. Not until he had
          learned his weakness, could he know the believer’s need of dependence on Christ. Amid the storm of temptation
          he had come to understand that man can walk safely only as in utter <nobr>self-distrust</nobr> he relies upon
          the Saviour....</p>
      <p>Christ mentioned to Peter only one condition of <nobr>service—“Lovest</nobr> thou me?” This is the essential
          qualiﬁcation.... The love of Christ is not a ﬁtful feeling, but a living principle,</p>
      <p>which is to be made manifest as an abiding power in the heart....</p>
      <p>The Saviour’s manner of dealing with Peter had a lesson for him and his brethren. Although Peter had denied his
          Lord, the love which Jesus bore him had never faltered. And as the apostle should take up the work of
          ministering the Word to others, he was to meet the transgressor with patience, sympathy, and forgiving love.
          Remembering his own weakness and failure, he was to deal with the sheep and lambs committed to his care as
          tenderly as Christ had dealt with him....</p>
      <p>Ever he exalted Jesus of Nazareth as the Hope of Israel, the Saviour of mankind. He brought his own life under
          the discipline of the Master Worker. By every means within his power he sought to educate the believers for
          active <nobr>service.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>514-516.</nobr></p>
