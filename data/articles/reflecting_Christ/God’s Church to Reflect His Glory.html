    <h1>God’s Church to Reﬂect His Glory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew
          forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter
          2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men. It was organized for service, and its mission is
          to carry the gospel to the world. From the beginning it has been God’s plan that through His church shall be
          reﬂected to the world His fullness and His sufﬁciency. The members of the church, those whom He has called out
          of darkness into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the repository of the riches
          of the grace of Christ; and through the church will eventually be made manifest, even to “the principalities
          and powers in heavenly places” (Ephesians 3:10), the ﬁnal and full display of the love of God.</p>
      <p>Many and wonderful are the promises recorded in the Scriptures regarding the church. “Mine house shall be
          called an house of prayer for all people” (Isaiah 56:7). “I will make them and the places round about my hill
          a blessing” (Ezekiel 34:26).... “Behold, I have</p>
      <p>graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me” (Isaiah 49:16).</p>
      <p>The church is God’s fortress, His city of refuge, which He holds in a revolted world. Any betrayal of the
          church is treachery to Him who has bought mankind with the blood of His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son. From
          the beginning, faithful souls have constituted the church on earth. In every age the Lord has had His
          watchmen, who have borne a faithful testimony to the generation in which they lived. These sentinels gave the
          message of warning; and when they were called to lay off their armor, others took up the work. God brought
          these witnesses into covenant relation with Himself, uniting the church on earth with the church in heaven. He
          has sent forth His angels to minister to His church, and the gates of hell have not been able to prevail
          against His people.</p>
      <p>Through centuries of persecution, conﬂict, and darkness, God has sustained His church. Not one cloud has fallen
          upon it that He has not prepared for; not one opposing force has risen to counterwork His work, that He has
          not foreseen. All has taken place as He predicted. He has not left His church forsaken, but has traced in
          prophetic declarations what would occur, and that which His Spirit inspired the prophets to foretell has been
          brought about. All His purposes will be fulﬁlled. His law is linked with His throne, and no power of evil can
          destroy it. Truth is inspired and guarded by God; and it will triumph over all opposition.— The Acts of the
          Apostles, <nobr>9-12.</nobr></p>
