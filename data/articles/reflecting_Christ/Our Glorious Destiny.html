    <h1>Our Glorious Destiny</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
          prepared for them that love him. 1 Corinthians 2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Through the gospel, souls that are degraded and enslaved by Satan are to be redeemed to share the glorious
          liberty of the sons of God. God’s purpose is not merely to deliver from the suffering that is the inevitable
          result of sin, but to save from sin itself. The soul, corrupted and deformed, is to be puriﬁed, transformed,
          that it may be clothed in “the beauty of the Lord our God,” “conformed to the image of his Son.” “Eye hath not
          seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
          that love him” (Psalm 90:17; Romans 8:29; 1 Corinthians 2:9). Eternity alone can reveal the glorious destiny
          to which man, restored to God’s image, may attain.</p>
      <p>In order for us to reach this high ideal, that which causes the soul to stumble must be sacriﬁced. It is
          through the will that sin retains its hold upon us.... Often it seems to us that</p>
      <p>to surrender the will to God is to consent to go through life maimed or crippled. But it is better, says
          Christ, for self to be maimed, wounded, crippled, if thus you may enter into life. That which you look upon as
          disaster is the door to highest beneﬁt.</p>
      <p>God is the fountain of life, and we can have life only as we are in communion with Him. Separated from God,
          existence may be ours for a little time, but we do not possess life....</p>
      <p>Only through the surrender of our will to God is it possible for Him to impart life to us. Only by receiving
          His life through <nobr>self-surrender</nobr> is it possible, said Jesus, for these hidden sins ...</p>
      <p>to be overcome. It is possible that you may bury them in your hearts and conceal them from human eyes, but how
          will you stand in God’s presence?... To sin, wherever found, God is a consuming ﬁre....</p>
      <p>It will require a sacriﬁce to give yourself to God; but it is a sacriﬁce of the lower for the higher, the
          earthly for the spiritual, the perishable for the eternal. God does not design that our will should be
          destroyed, for it is only through its exercise that we can accomplish what He would have us do. Our will is to
          be yielded to Him, that we may receive it again, puriﬁed and reﬁned, and so linked in sympathy with the Divine
          that He can pour through us the tides of His love and power. However bitter and painful this surrender may
          appear to the willful, wayward heart, yet “it is proﬁtable for thee.”</p>
      <p>Not until he fell crippled and helpless upon the breast of the covenant angel did Jacob know the victory of
          conquering faith and receive the title of a prince with <nobr>God.—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing,
          <nobr>60-62.</nobr></p>
