    <h1>Heart Missionaries are Needed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake
          died and was raised. 2 Corinthians 5:15, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who take up their appointed work will not only be a blessing to others, but they will themselves be
          blessed. The consciousness of duty well done will have a reﬂex inﬂuence upon their own souls. The despondent
          will forget their despondency, the weak will become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will ﬁnd an
          unfailing helper in Him who has called them.</p>
      <p>The church of Christ is organized for service. Its watchword is ministry. Its members are soldiers, to be
          trained for conﬂict under the Captain of their salvation. Christian ministers, physicians, teachers, have a
          broader work than many have recognized. They are not only to minister to the people, but to teach them to
          minister. They should not only give instruction in right principles, but educate their hearers to impart these
          principles. Truth that is not lived, that is not imparted, loses its <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power, its
          healing virtue. Its blessing can be retained only as it is shared.</p>
      <p>The monotony of our service for God needs to be broken up. Every church member should be engaged in some line
          of service for the Master. Some cannot do so much as others, but everyone should do his utmost to roll back
          the tide of disease and distress that is sweeping over our world....</p>
      <p>Educated workers who are consecrated to God can do service in a greater variety of ways and can accomplish more
          extensive work than can those who are uneducated. Their discipline of mind places them on vantage ground. But
          those who have neither great talents nor extensive education may minister acceptably to others. God will use
          men who are willing to be used. It is not the most brilliant or the most talented persons whose work produces
          the greatest and most lasting results. Men and women are needed who have heard a message from heaven. The most
          effective workers are those who respond to the invitation, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me” (Matthew
          11:29).</p>
      <p>It is heart missionaries that are needed. He whose heart God touches is ﬁlled with a great longing for those
          who have never known His love. Their condition impresses him with a sense of personal woe. Taking his life in
          his hand, he goes forth, a <nobr>heaven-sent,</nobr><nobr>heaven-inspired</nobr> messenger, to do a work in
          which angels can <nobr>cooperate.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, <nobr>148-150.</nobr></p>
