    <h1>Afﬂiction Spreads Knowledge of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take ... the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering afﬂiction,
          and of patience. James 5:10.</strong></p>
      <p>There was never one who walked among men more cruelly slandered than the Son of man. He was derided and mocked
          because of His unswerving obedience to the principles of God’s holy law. They hated Him without a cause. Yet
          He stood calmly before His enemies, declaring that reproach is a part of the Christian’s legacy, counseling
          His followers how to meet the arrows of malice, bidding them not to faint under persecution.</p>
      <p>While slander may blacken the reputation, it cannot stain the character. That is in God’s keeping. So long as
          we do not consent to sin, there is no power, whether human or satanic, that can bring a stain upon the soul. A
          man whose heart is stayed upon God is just the same in the hour of his most afﬂicting trials and most
          discouraging surroundings as when he was in prosperity, when the light and favor of God seemed to be upon him.
          His words, his motives, his actions, may be misrepresented and falsiﬁed, but he does not mind it, because he
          has greater interests at stake. Like Moses, he endures as “seeing him who is invisible” (Hebrews
          11:27)....</p>
      <p>In every age God’s chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted, yet through their afﬂiction the
          knowledge of God has been spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to step into the ranks and carry forward
          the same work, knowing that its foes can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. God means that truth
          shall be brought to the front and become the subject of examination and discussion, even through the contempt
          placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach, every effort to
          restrict liberty of conscience, is God’s means of awakening minds that otherwise might slumber.</p>
      <p>How often this result has been seen in the history of God’s messengers! When the noble and eloquent Stephen was
          stoned to death at the instigation of the Sanhedrin council, there was no loss to the cause of the gospel. The
          light of heaven that gloriﬁed his face, the divine compassion breathed in his dying prayer, were as a sharp
          arrow of conviction to the bigoted Sanhedrist who stood by, and Saul, the persecuting Pharisee, became a
          chosen vessel to bear the name of Christ before Gentiles and kings and the children of
          <nobr>Israel.—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, <nobr>32-34.</nobr></p>
