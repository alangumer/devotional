      <p><strong>As God’s fellow workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. 2 Corinthians 6:1,
          N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>All our church members should feel a deep interest in home and foreign missions. Great spiritual blessing will
          come to them as they make <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> efforts to plant the standard of truth in new
          territory. The money invested in this work will bring rich returns. New converts, rejoicing in the light
          received from the Word, will in their turn give of their means to carry the light to others.</p>
      <p>The Lord is calling upon His people to take up different lines of missionary work. Those in the highways and
          hedges are to hear the saving gospel message. Church members are to do evangelistic work in the homes of those
          of their friends and neighbors who have not yet received full evidence of the truth....</p>
      <p>Let those who take up this work make the life of Christ their constant study. Let them be intensely in earnest,
          using every capability in the Lord’s service. Precious results will follow sincere, unselﬁsh effort. From the
          great Teacher the workers will receive the highest of all education.</p>
      <p>Many of God’s people are to go forth with publications containing the light of present truth, into places where
          the third angel’s message has never been proclaimed. The work of the <nobr>canvasser-evangelist</nobr> who is
          imbued with the Spirit of God is fraught with wonderful possibilities for good. The presentation of the truth,
          in love and simplicity, from house to house, is in harmony with the instruction that Christ gave His disciples
          when He sent them out on their ﬁrst missionary tour. By songs of praise to God, humble, heartfelt prayers, and
          a simple presentation of Bible truth in the family circle, many will be reached. The Divine Worker will be
          present to send conviction to hearts. “I am with you alway” is His promise. With the assurance of the abiding
          presence of such a Helper, we may labor with faith and hope and courage.</p>
      <p>The monotony of our service for God needs to be broken up. Every church member should be engaged in some line
          of work for God. Let those who are well established in the truth go into neighboring places, and hold
          meetings, giving a cordial invitation to all. Let there be in these meetings melodious songs, fervent prayers,
          and the reading of God’s Word....</p>
      <p>There are others who can visit the homes of the people, reading to the members of the family on some simple
          impressive subject of Bible truth....</p>
      <p>There are those who, because of pressing home duties, may not be able to do <nobr>house-to-house</nobr> work.
          But let them not think that they can do nothing to help. They can encourage those who go out, and they can
          give of their means to help to sustain <nobr>them.—Manuscript</nobr> 150, 1903.</p>
