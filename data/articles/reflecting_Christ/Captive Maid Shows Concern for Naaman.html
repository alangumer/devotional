    <h1>Captive Maid Shows Concern for Naaman</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Syrians ... had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on
          Naaman’s wife. And she said unto her mistress, Would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for
          he would recover him of his leprosy. 2 Kings 5:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>“Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was ... a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.”</p>
      <p><nobr>Ben-hadad,</nobr> king of Syria, had defeated the armies of Israel.... Since that time the</p>
      <p>Syrians had maintained against Israel a constant border warfare, and in one of their raids they had carried
          away a little maid who, in the land of her captivity, “waited on Naaman’s wife.” A slave, far from her home,
          this little maid was nevertheless one of God’s witnesses, unconsciously fulﬁlling the purpose for which God
          had chosen Israel as His people.</p>
      <p>As she ministered in that heathen home, her sympathies were aroused in behalf of her master; and, remembering
          the wonderful miracles of healing wrought through Elisha, she said to her mistress, “Would God my Lord were
          with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.” She knew that the power of
          Heaven was with Elisha, and she believed that by this power Naaman could be healed.</p>
      <p>The conduct of the captive maid, the way that she bore herself in that heathen home, is a strong witness to the
          power of early home training. There is no higher trust than that committed to fathers and mothers in the care
          and training of their children. Parents have to do with the very foundations of habit and character. By their
          example and teaching the future of their children is largely decided.</p>
      <p>Happy are the parents whose lives are a true reﬂection of the divine, so that the promises and commands of God
          awaken in the child gratitude and reverence; the parents whose tenderness and justice and
          <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> interpret to the child the love and justice and <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> of
          God, and who by teaching the child to love and trust and obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and
          obey his Father in heaven. Parents who impart to the child such a gift have endowed him with a treasure more
          precious than the wealth of all the ages, a treasure as enduring as eternity....</p>
      <p>The parents of that Hebrew maid, as they taught her of God, did not know the destiny that would be hers. But
          they were faithful to their trust; and in the home of the captain of the Syrian host, their child bore witness
          to the God whom she had learned to honor.</p>
      <p>Naaman heard of the words that the maid had spoken to her mistress; and, obtaining permission from the king, he
          went forth to seek <nobr>healing.—Prophets</nobr> and Kings, <nobr>244-246.</nobr></p>
