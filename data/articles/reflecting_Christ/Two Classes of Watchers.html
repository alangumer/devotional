    <h1>Two Classes of Watchers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. Psalm 119:105.</strong></p>
      <p>The two classes of watchers represent the two classes who profess to be waiting for their Lord. They are called
          virgins because they profess a pure faith. By the lamps is represented the Word of God. The psalmist says,
          “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” The oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Thus the
          Spirit is represented in the prophecy of Zechariah.... “I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold,
          with a bowl upon the</p>
      <p>top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, ... and two olive trees by it.”
          ...</p>
      <p>From the two olive trees the golden oil was emptied through the golden pipes into the bowl of the candlestick,
          and thence into the golden lamps that gave light to the sanctuary. So from the holy ones that stand in God’s
          presence His Spirit is imparted to the human instrumentalities who are consecrated to His service. The mission
          of the two anointed ones is to communicate to God’s people that heavenly grace which alone can make His Word a
          lamp to the feet and a light to the path. “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of
          hosts.”</p>
      <p>In the parable, all the ten virgins went out to meet the bridegroom. All had lamps and vessels for oil. For a
          time there was seen no difference between them. So with the church that lives just before Christ’s second
          coming. All have a knowledge of the Scriptures. All have heard the message of Christ’s near approach, and
          conﬁdently expect His appearing. But as in the parable, so it is now. A time of waiting intervenes, faith is
          tried; and when the cry is heard, “Behold, the bridegroom cometh,” ... many are unready. They have no oil in
          their vessels with their lamps. They are destitute of the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>The theory of truth, unaccompanied by the Holy Spirit, cannot quicken the soul or sanctify the heart. One may
          be familiar with the commands and promises of the Bible; but unless the Spirit of God sets the truth home, the
          character will not be transformed. Without the enlightenment of the Spirit, men will not be able to
          distinguish truth from error, and they will fall under the masterful temptations of Satan....</p>
      <p>Character is not transferable. No man can believe for another. No man can receive the Spirit for another. No
          man can impart to another the character which is the fruit of the Spirit’s <nobr>working.—Christ’s</nobr>
