    <h1>Christ Eases the Burdens of Parents</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,
          and learn of me; ... and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. Matthew 11:28, 29.</strong></p>
      <p>No work can equal that of the Christian mother. She takes up her work with a sense of what it is to bring up
          her children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. How often will she feel her burden’s weight heavier
          than she can bear; and then how precious the privilege of taking it all to her sympathizing Saviour in prayer.
          She may lay her burden at His feet, and ﬁnd in His presence a strength that will sustain her, and give her
          cheerfulness, hope, courage, and wisdom in the most trying hours. How sweet to the <nobr>care-worn</nobr>
          mother is the consciousness of such a Friend in all her difﬁculties. If mothers would go to Christ more
          frequently, and trust Him more fully, their burdens would be easier, and they would ﬁnd rest to their
          souls.</p>
      <p>Jesus is a lover of children. The important responsibility of training her children should not rest alone upon
          the mother.... The father should encourage and sustain the mother in her</p>
      <p>work of care by his cheerful looks and kind words.... Her children must have her time</p>
      <p>and attention.... This training of children to meet the Bible standard will require time,</p>
      <p>perseverance, and prayer. This should be attended to if some things about the house are neglected.</p>
      <p>Many times in the day is the cry of Mother, Mother, heard, ﬁrst from one little troubled voice and then
          another. In answer to the cry, mother must turn here and there to attend to their demands.... A word of
          approval will bring sunshine to the heart for hours. Many</p>
      <p>precious beams of light and gladness can the mother shed here and there among her precious little ones. How
          closely can she bind those dear ones to her heart, that her presence will be to them the sunniest place in the
          world.</p>
      <p>But frequently the patience of the mother is taxed with these numerous little trials, that seem scarcely worth
          attention.... She almost forgets herself time and again, but a silent</p>
      <p>prayer to her pitying Redeemer calms her nerves, and she is enabled to hold the reins of
          <nobr>self-control</nobr> with quiet dignity. She speaks with calm voice, but it has cost her an effort to
          restrain harsh words and subdue angry feelings, which, if expressed, would have destroyed her inﬂuence, which
          it would have taken time to regain.... As the parents wish God to deal</p>
      <p>with them, so should they deal with their children.</p>
      <p>Our children are only the younger members of the Lord’s family, entrusted to us to educate wisely, to patiently
          discipline, that they may form Christian characters, and be qualiﬁed to bless others in this life, and enjoy
          the life to <nobr>come.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.</p>
