      <p><strong>Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God. Isaiah 43:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The faithful ambassador of Christ is not ashamed of the banner of truth. He does not cease from proclaiming the
          truth, however unpopular it may be. In all places, in season, out of season, he heralds the glad tidings of
          salvation. Missionaries for God are called to face dangers, endure privations, and suffer reproach for the
          truth’s sake, yet amid dangers, hardships, and reproach they are still to hold the banner aloft.</p>
      <p>The third angel proclaims his message in no whispered tones, in no hesitant manner. He cries with a loud voice,
          while ﬂying swiftly through the midst of heaven. This shows that the work of God’s servants is to be earnest
          and rapidly performed. They must be brave witnesses for the truth. With no shame upon their countenances, with
          uplifted heads, with the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shining upon them, with rejoicing that their
          redemption draweth nigh, they go forth declaring the last message of mercy to the world.</p>
      <p>These <nobr>last-day</nobr> witnesses are bold soldiers of Jesus Christ. They have tasted of the powers of the
          world to come. Their feet are not on sliding sand, but on solid rock. They are not easily moved away from the
          faith once delivered to the saints. These will be strengthened by their leader to cope with difﬁculties. They
          are messengers of righteousness, representatives of Christ, revealing the triumphs of grace.</p>
      <p>From these chosen men of God the truth will shine forth. It will be heard from their lips, reﬂected in their
          countenances, and demonstrated in their lives. They will be marked by purity and uncorruptness. The grace of
          Christ has a reﬁning, ennobling inﬂuence on the character. Many men and women of ability, reﬁnement, and
          education will throw their all on the Lord’s side. Many will part with friends and will sacriﬁce every worldly
          interest in order to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ. Their lives give evidence to the world of the
          power of Christianity. They witness that the gospel is what it purports to be, the power of God unto
          salvation. Bright beams of gospel truth are ﬂashed from them upon the path of those who are in darkness. Their
          unswerving ﬁdelity is registered in the books of <nobr>heaven.—Manuscript</nobr> 51, 1900.</p>
      <p>Those who walk even as Christ walked, who are patient, gentle, kind, meek, and lowly in heart, those who yoke
          up with Christ and lift His burdens, who yearn for souls as He yearned for <nobr>them—these</nobr> will enter
          into the joy of their Lord. They will see with Christ the travail of His soul, and be satisﬁed. Heaven will
          triumph, for the vacancies made in heaven by the fall of Satan and his angels will be ﬁlled by the redeemed of
          the <nobr>Lord.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 29, 1900.</p>
