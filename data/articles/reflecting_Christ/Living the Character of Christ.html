    <h1>Living the Character of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 2 Peter
          3:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The greatest work that can be done in our world is to glorify God by living the character of
          <nobr>Christ.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 6:439.</p>
      <p>In the second letter addressed by Peter to those who had obtained “like precious faith” with himself, the
          apostle sets forth the divine plan for the development of Christian character. He writes:</p>
      <p>“Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as his
          divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him
          that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that
          by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
          through lust.”</p>
      <p>“And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
          temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to
          brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be
          barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter <nobr>1:2-8).</nobr></p>
      <p>These words are full of instruction, and strike the keynote of victory. The apostle presents before the
          believers the ladder of Christian progress, every step of which represents advancement in the knowledge of
          God, and in the climbing of which there is to be no standstill. Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
          patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity are the rounds of the ladder. We are saved by climbing
          round after round, mounting step after step, to the height of Christ’s ideal for us. Thus He is made unto us
          wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctiﬁcation, and redemption.</p>
      <p>God has called His people to glory and virtue, and these will be manifest in the lives of all who are truly
          connected with Him. Having become partakers of the heavenly gift, they are to go on unto perfection, being
          “kept by the power of God through faith” (1 Peter 1:5).</p>
      <p>It is the glory of God to give His virtue to His children. He desires to see men and women reaching the highest
          standard; and when by faith they lay hold of the power of Christ, when they plead His unfailing promises, and
          claim them as their own, when with an importunity that will not be denied they seek for the power of the Holy
          Spirit, they will be made complete in <nobr>Him.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 529, 530.</p>
