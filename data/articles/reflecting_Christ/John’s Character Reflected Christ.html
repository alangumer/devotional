    <h1>John’s Character Reﬂected Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation
          for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 1 John 4:10, 11.</strong></p>
      <p>The conﬁding love and unselﬁsh devotion manifested in the life and character of John present lessons of untold
          value to the Christian church. John did not naturally possess the loveliness of character that his later
          experience revealed. By nature he had serious defects. He was not only proud, <nobr>self-assertive,</nobr> and
          ambitious for honor, but impetuous, and resentful under injury. He and his brother were called “sons of
          thunder.” Evil temper, the desire for revenge, the spirit of criticism, were all in the beloved disciple. But
          beneath all this the divine Teacher discerned the ardent, sincere, loving heart. Jesus rebuked his
          <nobr>self-seeking,</nobr> disappointed his ambitions, tested his faith. But He revealed to him that for which
          his soul <nobr>longed—the</nobr> beauty of holiness, the transforming power of love....</p>
      <p>The lessons of Christ, setting forth meekness and humility and love as essential to growth in grace and a
          ﬁtness for His work, were of the highest value to John. He treasured every lesson and constantly sought to
          bring his life into harmony with the divine pattern....</p>
      <p>His Master’s lessons were graven on his soul. When he testiﬁed of the Saviour’s grace, his simple language was
          eloquent with the love that pervaded his whole being.</p>
      <p>It was John’s deep love for Christ which led him always to desire to be close by His side. The Saviour loved
          all the Twelve, but John’s was the most receptive spirit. He was younger than the others, and with more of the
          child’s conﬁding trust he opened his heart to Jesus. Thus he came more into sympathy with Christ, and through
          him the Saviour’s deepest spiritual teaching was communicated to the people.</p>
      <p>Jesus loves those who represent the Father, and John could talk of the Father’s love as no other of the
          disciples could. He revealed to his fellow men that which he felt in his own soul, representing in his
          character the attributes of God. The glory of the Lord was expressed in his face. The beauty of holiness which
          had transformed him shone with a Christlike radiance from his countenance. In adoration and love he beheld the
          Saviour until likeness to Christ and fellowship with Him became his one desire, and in his character was
          reﬂected the character of his <nobr>Master.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>539-545.</nobr></p>
