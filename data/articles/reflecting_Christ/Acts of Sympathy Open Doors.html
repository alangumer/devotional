    <h1>Acts of Sympathy Open Doors</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
          Matthew 20:28.</strong></p>
      <p>Many have no faith in God and have lost conﬁdence in man. But they appreciate acts of sympathy and helpfulness.
          As they see one with no inducement of earthly praise or compensation coming to their homes to minister to the
          sick, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, and comfort the sad, and ever tenderly pointing all to Him of
          whose love and pity the human worker is but the <nobr>messenger—as</nobr> they see this, their hearts are
          touched. Gratitude springs up; faith is kindled. They see that God cares for them, and they are prepared to
          listen to the teaching of His Word.</p>
      <p>Whether in foreign missions or in the home ﬁeld, all missionaries, both men and women, will gain much more
          ready access to the people, and will ﬁnd their usefulness greatly increased, if they are able to minister to
          the sick. Women who go as missionaries to heathen lands may thus ﬁnd opportunity for giving the gospel to the
          women of those lands, when every other door of access is closed. All gospel workers should know how to give
          the simple treatments that do so much to relieve pain and remove disease.</p>
      <p>Gospel workers should be able also to give instruction in the principles of healthful living. There is sickness
          everywhere, and much of it might be prevented by attention to the laws of health. The people need to see the
          bearing of health principles upon their <nobr>well-being,</nobr> both for this life and for the life to come.
          They need to be awakened to their responsibility for the human habitation ﬁtted up by their Creator as His
          dwelling place, and over which He desires them to be faithful stewards.</p>
      <p>Thousands need and would gladly receive instruction concerning the simple methods of treating the
          <nobr>sick—methods</nobr> that are taking the place of the use of poisonous drugs. There is great need of
          instruction in regard to dietetic reform. Wrong habits of eating and use of unhealthful food are in no small
          degree responsible for the intemperance and crime and wretchedness that curse the world.</p>
      <p>In teaching health principles, keep before the mind the great object of <nobr>reform—that</nobr> its purpose is
          to secure the highest development of body and mind and soul. Show that the laws of nature, being the laws of
          God, are designed for our good; that obedience to them promotes happiness in this life, and aids in the
          preparation for the life to <nobr>come.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 24, 1914.</p>
