    <h1>Church Members are Blessed to Bless Others</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are the salt of the earth. Matthew 5:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ’s church is to be a blessing, and its members are to be blessed as they bless others. The object of God
          in choosing a people before all the world was not only that He might adopt them as His sons and daughters, but
          that through them He might confer on the world the beneﬁts of divine illumination. When the Lord chose Abraham
          it was not simply to be the special friend of God, but to be a medium of the precious and peculiar privileges
          the Lord desired to bestow upon the nations. He was to be a light amid the moral darkness of his
          surroundings.</p>
      <p>Whenever God blesses His children with light and truth, it is not only that they may have the gift of eternal
          life, but that those around them may also be spiritually enlightened.... “Ye</p>
      <p>are the salt of the earth.” And when God makes His children salt, it is not only for their own preservation,
          but that they may be agents in preserving others.</p>
      <p>The religion of Christ is not a selﬁsh religion. It is not to be kept under lock and key, but it is to be an
          inﬂuence of power going forth from every genuine Christian to enlighten those that sit in darkness. Every soul
          connected with a true Christian will be made better thereby. We are to be God’s light bearers, reﬂecting the
          steady beams of heaven upon others.</p>
      <p>It is through the merits of Christ that all our spiritual and temporal blessings are given us to enjoy. The
          salvation of Christ was placed within our reach that we might lay hold upon it by faith, that we might weave
          the love of Christ into our characters, and practice it in our lives, that we might be a blessing to all our
          race. But not one of us can shed light upon others unless we ourselves have gathered rays of divine
          illumination from the Word of God. We must have the Christlike mold of character or we cannot be true
          representatives of our Lord.</p>
      <p>We can do nothing without the help of God. The Spirit of God must work with our efforts, and if God’s blessing
          attends us, we shall be channels of light. The Lord is willing to give us all an experience, which, if
          improved, will bring us from the lowlands of earth into close, heavenly relationship with God, and every ﬁber
          of selﬁshness will be uprooted from our natures.</p>
      <p>Do you shine as living stones in God’s building? ... We have not the genuine religion, unless it exerts a
          controlling inﬂuence upon us in every business transaction. We should have practical godliness to weave into
          our lifework. We should have the transforming grace of Christ upon our hearts. We need a great deal less of
          self, and more of Jesus....</p>
      <p>We need plenteous grace to keep us humble, to make us prayerful, pitiful, tenderhearted, and courteous, that we
          may deal with others as the Lord designs we <nobr>should.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, February 3,
          1890.</p>
