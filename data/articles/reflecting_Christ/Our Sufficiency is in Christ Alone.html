      <p><strong>God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
          cruciﬁed unto me, and I unto world. Galatians 6:14.</strong></p>
      <p>By <nobr>faith—faith</nobr> that renounces all <nobr>self-trust—the</nobr> needy suppliant is to lay hold upon
          inﬁnite power.</p>
      <p>No outward observances can take the place of simple faith and entire renunciation of self.... We can only
          consent for Christ to accomplish the work. Then the language of the</p>
      <p>soul will be, Lord, take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it
          for Thee. Save me in spite of myself, my weak, unchristlike self. Mold me, fashion me, raise me into a pure
          and holy atmosphere, where the rich current of Thy love can ﬂow through my soul.</p>
      <p>It is not only at the beginning of the Christian life that this renunciation of self is to be made. At every
          advance step heavenward it is to be renewed. All our good works are dependent on a power outside of ourselves.
          Therefore there needs to be a continual reaching out of the heart after God, a continual, earnest,
          heartbreaking confession of sin and humbling of the soul before Him. Only by constant renunciation of self and
          dependence of Christ can we walk safely.</p>
      <p>The nearer we come to Jesus and the more clearly we discern the purity of His character, the more clearly we
          shall discern the exceeding sinfulness of sin and the less we shall feel like exalting ourselves. Those whom
          heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to parade their own goodness. The apostle Peter became a faithful
          minister of Christ, and he was greatly honored by divine light and power; he had an active part in the
          upbuilding of Christ’s church; but Peter never forgot the fearful experience of his humiliation; his sin was
          forgiven; yet well he knew that for the weakness of character which had caused his fall only the grace of
          Christ could avail. He found in himself nothing in which to glory.</p>
      <p>None of the apostles or prophets ever claimed to be without sin. Men who have lived nearest to God, men who
          would sacriﬁce life itself rather than knowingly commit a wrong act, men whom God had honored with divine
          light and power, have confessed the sinfulness of their own nature. They have put no conﬁdence in the ﬂesh,
          have claimed no righteousness of their own, but have trusted wholly in the righteousness of Christ. So will it
          be with all who behold Christ.</p>
      <p>At every advance step in Christian experience our repentance will deepen.... Then our</p>
      <p>lips will not be opened in <nobr>self-gloriﬁcation.</nobr> We shall know that our sufﬁciency is in Christ
          <nobr>alone.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, <nobr>159-161.</nobr></p>
