    <h1>Like Daniel, be Honest and Upright</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The integrity of the upright shall guide them. Proverbs 11:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The case of Daniel, portrayed in a very limited manner by the prophetic pencil, has a lesson for us. It reveals
          the fact that a businessman is not necessarily a sharp policy man. He can be a man instructed of God at every
          step. Daniel while the prime minister of the kingdom of Babylon, was a prophet of God, receiving the light of
          heavenly inspiration....</p>
      <p>Especially are businessmen needed, not irreligious businessmen, but those who will weave the great, grand
          principles of truth into all their business transactions. Men who have qualiﬁcations for the work need to have
          their talents exercised and perfected by most thorough study and training. Not one businessman that has any
          appointment in the work need to be a novice. If men in any line of work need to improve their opportunities to
          become wise, efﬁcient businessmen, it is those who are using their ability in the work of building up the
          kingdom of God in our world.</p>
      <p>The lessons for the present time are for all to understand, but they are very feebly appreciated. There should
          be greater thoroughness in labor; and more vigilant waiting, more vigilant watching and praying, and more
          vigilant working, in prospect of the events now taking place, and which are swelling to large importance as we
          near the close of this earth’s history. The human agent is to reach for perfection, to be an ideal Christian,
          complete in Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Those who labor in business lines should exercise every precaution against error through wrong principles or
          methods. Their record may be like that of Daniel in the courts of Babylon. In all his business transactions,
          when subjected to the closest scrutiny, there was not found one item that was faulty. He was a sample of what
          every business man may be. But the heart must be converted and consecrated. The motives must be right with
          God. The inner lamp must be supplied with the oil that ﬂows from the true messengers of heaven through the
          golden tubes into the golden bowl. Then the Lord’s communication never comes to man in vain.</p>
      <p>God will not accept the most splendid services unless self is laid upon the altar, a living, consuming
          sacriﬁce. The root must be holy, else there can be no sound, healthful fruit, which alone is acceptable to
          God.... While worldly ambition and worldly projects and the</p>
      <p>greatest plans and purposes of men shall fade like the grass, “they that be wise shall shine as the brightness
          of the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
          <nobr>ever.”—&lt;span</nobr><nobr>class="egw-eng"</nobr> title=" SpTA09 65.1"&gt;Special
          Testimonies,&lt;/em&gt; Series A, No. 9, pp. 65, 66.</p>
