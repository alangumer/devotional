    <h1>Paul’s Triumphant Testimony</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have fought a good ﬁght, I have ﬁnished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up
          for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day. 2 Timothy
          4:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>This man of faith [Paul] beholds the ladder of Jacob’s vision, representing Christ, who has connected earth
          with heaven, and ﬁnite man with the inﬁnite God. His faith is strengthened as he calls to mind how patriarchs
          and prophets have relied upon the One who is his support and consolation, and for whom he is giving his
          life.</p>
      <p>From these holy men who from century to century have borne testimony for their faith, he hears the assurance
          that God is true. His fellow apostles, who, to preach the gospel of Christ, went forth to meet religious
          bigotry and heathen superstition, persecution, and contempt, who counted not their lives dear unto themselves
          that they might bear aloft the light of the cross amidst the dark mazes of <nobr>inﬁdelity—these</nobr> he
          hears witnessing to Jesus as the Son of God, the Saviour of the world.</p>
      <p>From the rack, the stake, the dungeon, from dens and caves of the earth, there falls upon his ear the martyr’s
          shout of triumph. He hears the witness of steadfast souls, who, though destitute, afﬂicted, tormented, yet
          bear fearless, solemn testimony for the faith, declaring, “I know whom I have believed.” These, yielding up
          their lives for the faith, declare to the world that He in whom they have trusted is able to save to the
          uttermost.</p>
      <p>Ransomed by the sacriﬁce of Christ, washed from sin in His blood, and clothed in His righteousness, Paul has
          the witness in himself that his soul is precious in the sight of his Redeemer. His life is hid with Christ in
          God, and he is persuaded that He who has conquered death is able to keep that which is committed to His trust.
          His mind grasps the Saviour’s promise, “I will raise him up at the last day” (John 6:40). His thoughts and
          hopes are centered on the second coming of his Lord. And as the sword of the executioner descends and the
          shadows of death gather about the martyr, his latest thought springs forward, as will his earliest in the
          great awakening, to meet the <nobr>Life-giver,</nobr> who shall welcome him to the joy of the blest....</p>
      <p>Like a trumpet peal his voice has rung out through all the ages since, nerving with his own courage thousands
          of witnesses for Christ, and wakening in thousands of <nobr>sorrow-stricken</nobr> hearts the echo of his own
          triumphant joy: ... “I have fought a good ﬁght, I have ﬁnished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth
          there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord ... shall give me at that
          <nobr>day.”—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 512, 513.</p>
