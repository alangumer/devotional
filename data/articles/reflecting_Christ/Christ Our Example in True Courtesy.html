    <h1>Christ Our Example in True Courtesy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous. 1
          Peter 3:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who work for Christ are to be upright and trustworthy, ﬁrm as a rock to principle, and at the same time
          kind and courteous. Courtesy is one of the graces of the Spirit. To deal with human minds is the greatest work
          ever given to man; and he who would ﬁnd access to hearts must heed the injunction, “Be pitiful, be courteous.”
          Love will do that which argument will fail to accomplish. But a moment’s petulance, a single gruff answer, a
          lack of Christian politeness and courtesy in some small matter, may result in the loss of both friends and
          inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>What Christ was on this earth, the Christian worker should strive to be. He is our example, not only in His
          spotless purity, but in His patience, gentleness, and winsomeness of disposition. His life is an illustration
          of true courtesy. He had ever a kind look and a word of comfort for the needy and the oppressed. His presence
          brought a purer atmosphere into the home. His life was a leaven working amid the elements of society. Pure and
          undeﬁled, He walked among the thoughtless, the rude, the uncourteous; among unjust publicans, unrighteous
          Samaritans, heathen soldiers, rough peasants, and the mixed multitude. He spoke a word of sympathy here and a
          word there. As He saw men weary, and compelled to bear heavy burdens, He shared their burdens, and repeated to
          them the lessons He had learned from nature, of the love, the kindness, the goodness of God. He sought to
          inspire with hope the most rough and unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might attain
          such a character as would make them manifest as children of God.</p>
      <p>The religion of Jesus softens whatever is hard and rough in the temper, and smooths whatever is rugged and
          sharp in the manners. It makes the words gentle and the demeanor winning. Let us learn from Christ how to
          combine a high sense of purity and integrity with sunniness of disposition. A kind, courteous Christian is the
          most powerful argument that can be produced in favor of Christianity.</p>
      <p>Kind words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. The Scripture says of Christ, that grace was poured into
          His lips, that He might “know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.” And the Lord bids us, “Let
          your speech be alway with grace” “that it may minister grace unto the <nobr>hearers.”—Gospel</nobr> Workers,
          121, 122.</p>
      <p>The essence of true politeness is consideration for others. <nobr>—Education,</nobr> 241.</p>
