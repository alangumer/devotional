    <h1>The Work of Both Parents is Important</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>[The Lord] blesses the home of the righteous. Proverbs 3:33, N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The Word of God should be judiciously brought to bear upon ... youthful minds, and be their standard of
          rectitude, correcting their errors, enlightening and guiding their minds, which will be far more effectual in
          restraining and controlling the impulsive temperament than harsh words, which will provoke to wrath....</p>
      <p>A sunny countenance and cheerful, encouraging words will brighten the poorest home, and be as a talisman to
          guard the father and the children from the many temptations that allure them from the love of home....</p>
      <p>But the work of making home happy does not rest upon the mother alone. Fathers have an important part to act.
          The husband is the <nobr>house-band</nobr> of the home treasures, binding by his strong, earnest, devoted
          affection the members of the household, mother and children, together in the strongest bonds of union. It is
          for him to encourage, with cheerful words, the efforts of the mother in rearing her children.</p>
      <p>The mother seldom appreciates her own work, and frequently sets so low an estimate upon her labor that she
          regards it as domestic drudgery. She goes through the same round day after day, week after week, with no
          special marked results. She cannot tell, at the close of the day, the many little things she has accomplished.
          Placed beside her husband’s achievement, she feels that she has done nothing worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>The father frequently comes in with a <nobr>self-satisﬁed</nobr> air, and proudly recounts what he has
          accomplished during the day....She has not done much except take care of the children, cook</p>
      <p>the meals, and keep the house in order. She has not acted the merchant, bought nor sold; she has not acted the
          farmer, in tilling the soil; she has not acted the mechanic— therefore she has done nothing to make her
          weary....</p>
      <p>Could the veil be withdrawn, and father and mother see as God sees the work of the day, and see how His inﬁnite
          eye compares the work of the one with that of the other, they would be astonished at the heavenly revelation.
          The father would view his labors in a more modest light, while the mother would have new courage and energy to
          pursue her labor with wisdom, perseverance, and patience.</p>
      <p>Now she knows its value. While the father has been dealing with the things which must perish and pass away, the
          mother has been dealing with developing minds and character, working, not only for time, but for eternity. Her
          work, if done faithfully in God, will be immortalized.— The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.</p>
