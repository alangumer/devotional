    <h1>Christ Came To Magnify His Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord was pleased, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify his law and make it glorious. Isaiah
          42:21, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Through the devices of the great apostate, man has been led to separate himself from God, and has yielded to
          the temptations of the adversary of God and man in committing sin and breaking the law of the Most High. God
          could not alter one jot or tittle of His holy law to meet man in his fallen condition; for this would reﬂect
          discredit upon the wisdom of God in making a law by which to govern heaven and earth. But God could give His
          <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son to become man’s substitute and surety, to suffer the penalty that was merited
          by the transgressor, and to impart to the repentant soul His perfect righteousness.</p>
      <p>Christ became the sinless sacriﬁce for a guilty race, making men prisoners of hope, so that, through repentance
          toward God because they had broken His holy law, and through faith in Christ as their substitute, surety, and
          righteousness, they might be brought back to loyalty to God and to obedience to His holy law....</p>
      <p>The life and death of Christ in behalf of sinful man were for the purpose of restoring the sinner to God’s
          favor, through imparting to him the righteousness that would meet the claims of the law, and ﬁnd acceptance
          with the Father. But it is ever the purpose of Satan to make void the law of God, and to pervert the true
          meaning of the plan of salvation. Therefore he has originated the falsehood that the sacriﬁce of Christ on
          Calvary’s cross was for the purpose of freeing men from the obligation of keeping the commandments of God. He
          has foisted upon the world the deception that God has abolished His constitution, thrown away His moral
          standard, and made void His holy and perfect law. Had He done this, at what terrible expense would it have
          been to Heaven!</p>
      <p>Instead of proclaiming the abolition of the law, Calvary’s cross proclaims in thunder tones its immutable and
          eternal character. Could the law have been abolished, and the government of heaven and earth and the
          unnumbered worlds of God maintained, Christ need not have died. The death of Christ was to forever settle the
          question of the validity of the law of Jehovah. Having suffered the full penalty for a guilty world, Jesus
          became the mediator between God and man, to restore the repenting soul to favor with God by giving him grace
          to keep the law of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Christ came not to destroy the law or the prophets, but to fulﬁll them to the very letter. The atonement of
          Calvary vindicated the law of God as holy, just, and true, not only before the fallen world, but before heaven
          and before worlds <nobr>unfallen.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 20, 1895.</p>
