    <h1>The Highway to Health</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. Psalm
          34:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The consciousness of rightdoing is the best medicine for diseased bodies and minds. The special blessing of God
          resting upon the receiver is health and strength. One whose mind is quiet and satisﬁed in God is on the
          highway to health. To have the consciousness that the eye of the Lord is upon us, and that His ear is open to
          our prayers, is a satisfaction indeed. To know that we have a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> Friend to whom we can
          conﬁde all the secrets of the soul is a happiness which words can never express. Those whose moral faculties
          are clouded by disease are not the ones to rightly represent the Christian life or the beauties of holiness.
          They are too often in the ﬁre of fanaticism, or the water of cold indifference or stolid gloom.</p>
      <p>Those who do not feel that it is a religious duty to discipline the mind to dwell upon cheerful subjects will
          usually be found at one of two extremes: they will be elated by a continual round of exciting amusements,
          indulging in frivolous conversation, laughing, and joking, or they will be depressed, having great trials and
          mental conﬂicts, which they think but few have ever experienced or can understand.... Appropriate labor, the
          healthy exercise</p>
      <p>of all their powers, would withdraw their thoughts from themselves....</p>
      <p>If they would train their minds to dwell upon themes which have nothing to do with self, they might yet be
          useful....</p>
      <p>Despondent feelings are frequently the result of too much leisure. The hands and mind should be occupied in
          useful labor, lightening the burdens of others; and those who are thus employed will beneﬁt themselves
          also....</p>
      <p>The mind should be drawn away from self; it powers should be exercised in devising means to make others happier
          and better. “Pure religion and undeﬁled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows
          in their afﬂiction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world” (James 1:27).</p>
      <p>True religion ennobles the mind, reﬁnes the taste, sanctiﬁes the judgment, and makes its possessor a partaker
          of the purity and holiness of heaven. It brings angels near, and separates us more and more from the spirit
          and inﬂuence of the world. It enters into all the acts and relations of life, and gives us the “spirit of ...
          a sound mind,” and the result is happiness and <nobr>peace.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, October 23,
          1884.</p>
