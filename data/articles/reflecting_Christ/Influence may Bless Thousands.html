    <h1>Inﬂuence may Bless Thousands</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. 1 Thessalonians 1:8,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The life of Christ was an <nobr>ever-widening,</nobr> shoreless inﬂuence, an inﬂuence that bound Him to God and
          to the whole human family. Through Christ, God has invested man with an inﬂuence that makes it impossible for
          him to live to himself. Individually we are connected with our fellow men, a part of God’s great whole, and we
          stand under mutual obligations. No man can be independent of his fellow men; for the <nobr>well-being</nobr>
          of each affects others. It is God’s purpose that each shall feel himself necessary to others’ welfare, and
          seek to promote their happiness.</p>
      <p>Every soul is surrounded by an atmosphere of its <nobr>own—an</nobr> atmosphere, it may be, charged with the
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of faith, courage, and hope, and sweet with the fragrance of love. Or it may be
          heavy and chilled with the gloom of discontent and selﬁshness, or poisonous with the deadly taint of cherished
          sin. By the atmosphere surrounding us, every person with whom we come in contact is consciously or
          unconsciously affected.</p>
      <p>This is a responsibility from which we cannot free ourselves. Our words, our acts, our dress, our deportment,
          even the expression of the countenance, has an inﬂuence. Upon the impression thus made there hang results for
          good or evil which no man can measure. Every impulse thus imparted is seed sown which will produce its
          harvest. It is a link in the long chain of human events, extending, we know not whither. If by our example we
          aid others in the development of good principles, we give them power to do good. In their turn they exert the
          same inﬂuence upon others, and they upon still others. Thus by our unconscious inﬂuence thousands may be
          blessed.</p>
      <p>Throw a pebble into the lake, and a wave is formed, and another and another; and as they increase, the circle
          widens, until it reaches the very shore. So with our inﬂuence. Beyond our knowledge or control it tells upon
          others in blessing....</p>
      <p>The silent witness of a true, unselﬁsh, godly life carries an almost irresistible inﬂuence. By revealing in our
          own life the character of Christ we cooperate with Him in the work of saving souls. It is only be revealing in
          our life His character that we can cooperate with Him. And the wider the sphere of our inﬂuence, the more good
          we may <nobr>do.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, 339, 340.</p>
