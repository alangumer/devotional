    <h1>Christ’s Compassion Knew No Limit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>This was to fulﬁl what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, “He took our inﬁrmities and bore our
          diseases.” Matthew 8:17, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant of man’s necessity. He “took our inﬁrmities,
          and bare our sicknesses,” that He might minister to every need of humanity. The burden of disease and
          wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was His mission to bring to men complete restoration; He came to
          give them health and peace and perfection of character.</p>
      <p>Varied were the circumstances and needs of those who besought His aid, and none who came to Him went away
          unhelped. From Him ﬂowed a stream of healing power, and in body and mind and soul men were made whole.</p>
      <p>The Saviour’s work was not restricted to any time or place. His compassion knew no limit. On so large a scale
          did He conduct His work of healing and teaching that there was no building in Palestine large enough to
          receive the multitudes that thronged to Him. On the green hillslopes of Galilee, in the thoroughfares of
          travel, by the seashore, in the synagogues, and in every place where the sick could be brought to Him was to
          be found His hospital. In every city, every town, every village through which He passed, He laid His hands
          upon the afﬂicted ones, and healed them. Wherever there were hearts ready to receive His message, He comforted
          them with the assurance of their heavenly Father’s love. All day He ministered to those who came to Him; in
          the evening He gave attention to such as through the day must toil to earn a pittance for the support of their
          families.</p>
      <p>Jesus carried the awful weight of responsibility for the salvation of men. He knew that unless there was a
          decided change in the principles and purposes of the human race, all would be lost. This was the burden of His
          soul, and none could appreciate the weight that rested upon Him. Through childhood, youth, and manhood, He
          walked alone....</p>
      <p>Day by day He met trials and temptations; day by day He was brought into contact with evil, and witnessed its
          power upon those whom He was seeking to bless and to save. Yet He did not fail nor become discouraged....</p>
      <p>He was always patient and cheerful, and the afﬂicted hailed Him as a messenger of life and peace. He saw the
          needs of men and women, children and youth, and to all He gave the invitation, “Come unto me.” ...</p>
      <p>As He passed through the towns and cities, He was like a vital current, diffusing life and
          <nobr>joy.—Gospel</nobr> Workers, <nobr>41-43.</nobr></p>
