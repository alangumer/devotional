    <h1>We May Connect a Soul to Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou
          shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. Acts 13:47.</strong></p>
      <p>Many professed Christians are laying upon the <nobr>foundation-stone</nobr> wood, hay, and stubble, which the
          ﬁres of the last day will consume. They engage in work that wearies, work that occupies golden hours; but it
          is not work that need be done. Their time is occupied, their energies exhausted, in that which will bring no
          precious returns either in this life or in the future immortal life. What a difference will be seen when
          spiritual work engages the mind, when the talents are employed in the service of Jesus! The light that He has
          given us will then shine forth in direct, concentrated rays to others. All that we do for Jesus will enable us
          to enjoy this life better.</p>
      <p>Oh, that all could see, as I have seen, the joy of those who have labored to the best of their ability, in
          humility and meekness, to help souls to come to Jesus! Oh, the joy that will be realized by the workers when
          the souls saved through their instrumentality express their gratitude in the mansions above!</p>
      <p>While Christ will be gloriﬁed as the only Redeemer, there will be an overﬂow of gratitude from the saved for
          the human instrumentalities employed in their salvation. Their gratitude to those who rescued them will ﬁnd
          expression in words like these: “I was pursuing a course that was a dishonor and an offense to my Redeemer;
          you manifested a love for my soul; you opened to me the Word of God. I was on the brink of ruin; your prayers,
          your tearful entreaties, your earnest interest, arrested my attention. I thought that you must have the truth
          or you would not be so earnest for the salvation of others. I read the Word of God for myself, and found that
          what you told me was the truth. I am saved, and I will praise my Redeemer for His matchless mercy and
          pardoning love.”</p>
      <p>Those who think they can do but little should improve every opportunity to do that little. It may be the
          smallest link in the longest chain. Separated from other inﬂuences, it may appear of little worth; but in
          God’s great chain of circumstances it may be the link which connects a soul to Heaven. All can do something if
          they will; but too often selﬁshness prevents them from doing what they might, until the souls whom they might
          have saved are beyond the reach of human effort.</p>
      <p>Dear brethren and sisters, you need divine enlightenment. When you have such a close connection with the
          world’s Redeemer as you should have, you will be led to make prompt, determined, personal efforts to save your
          fellow men. The future of God’s people lies in the present. <nobr>—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, January 28,
