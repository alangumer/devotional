    <h1>Abraham Obeyed God’s Voice</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. Genesis
          26:5.</strong></p>
      <p>[Abraham’s] own example, the silent inﬂuence of his daily life, was a constant lesson. The unswerving
          integrity, the benevolence and unselﬁsh courtesy, which had won the admiration of kings, were displayed in the
          home. There was a fragrance about the life, a nobility and loveliness of character, which revealed to all that
          he was connected with Heaven. He did not neglect the soul of the humblest servant. In his household there was
          not one law for the master and another for the servant; a royal way for the rich and another for the poor. All
          were treated with justice and compassion, as inheritors with him of the grace of life.</p>
      <p>“He will command his ... household.” There would be no sinful neglect to restrain the evil propensities of his
          children, no weak, unwise, indulgent favoritism; no yielding of his conviction of duty to the claims of
          mistaken affection. Abraham would not only give right instruction, but he would maintain the authority of just
          and righteous laws.</p>
      <p>How few there are in our day who follow this example! On the part of too many parents there is a blind and
          selﬁsh sentimentalism, miscalled love, which is manifested in leaving children, with their unformed judgment
          and undisciplined passions, to the control of their own will. This is the veriest cruelty to the youth, and a
          great wrong to the world. Parental indulgence causes disorder in families and in society. It conﬁrms in the
          young the desire to follow inclination, instead of submitting to the divine requirements. Thus they grow up
          with a heart averse to doing God’s will, and they transmit their irreligious, insubordinate spirit to their
          children and children’s children. Like Abraham, parents should command their households after them. Let
          obedience to parental authority be taught and enforced as the ﬁrst step in obedience to the authority of
          God....</p>
      <p>Those who seek to lessen the claims of God’s holy law are striking directly at the foundation of the government
          of families and nations. Religious parents, failing to walk in His statutes, do not command their household to
          keep the way of the Lord. The law of God is not made the rule of life. The children, as they make homes of
          their own, feel under no obligation to teach their children what they themselves have never been taught. And
          this is why there are so many godless families....</p>
      <p>Not until parents themselves walk in the law of the Lord with perfect hearts will they be prepared to command
          their children after them. A reformation in this respect is <nobr>needed—a</nobr> reformation which shall be
          deep and <nobr>broad.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 142, 143.</p>
