    <h1>Sanctiﬁcation Embraces The Entire Being</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be
          preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thessalonians 5:23.</strong></p>
      <p>The sanctiﬁcation set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire <nobr>being—spirit,</nobr> soul, and body.
          Paul prayed for the Thessalonians that their “whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
          coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Again he writes to believers: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
          mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto God” (Romans 12:1).</p>
      <p>In the time of ancient Israel, every offering brought as a sacriﬁce to God was carefully examined. If any
          defect was discovered in the animal presented, it was refused; for God had commanded that the offering be
          “without blemish.” So Christians are bidden to present their bodies, “a living sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable unto
          God.”</p>
      <p>In order to do this, all their powers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that
          weakens physical or mental strength unﬁts man for the service of his Creator. And will God be pleased with
          anything less than the best we can offer? Said Christ: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
          heart.”</p>
      <p>Those who do love God with all the heart will desire to give Him the best service of their life, and they will
          be constantly seeking to bring every power of their being into harmony with the laws that will promote their
          ability to do His will. They will not, by the indulgence of appetite or passion, enfeeble or deﬁle the
          offering which they present to their heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>Peter says: “Abstain from ﬂeshly lusts, which war against the soul” (1 Peter 2:11). Every sinful gratiﬁcation
          tends to benumb the faculties and deaden the mental and spiritual perceptions, and the Word or the Spirit of
          God can make but a feeble impression upon the heart. Paul writes to the Corinthians: “Let us cleanse ourselves
          from all ﬁlthiness of the ﬂesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God” (2 Corinthians 7:1). And
          with the fruits of the <nobr>Spirit—“love,</nobr> joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
          <nobr>meekness”—he</nobr> classes “temperance” (Galatians 5:22, 23).</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding these inspired declarations, how many professed Christians are enfeebling their powers in the
          pursuit of gain or the worship of fashion; how many are debasing their godlike manhood by gluttony, by wine
          drinking, by forbidden pleasure....</p>
      <p>He whose body is the temple of the Holy Spirit will not be enslaved by a pernicious habit. His powers belong to
          Christ, who has bought him with the price of <nobr>blood.—The</nobr> Great Controversy,
          <nobr>473-475.</nobr></p>
