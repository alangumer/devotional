    <h1>Principles That Underlie The Law Of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:3. In Christ’s sermon on
          the mount, light and truth are given, and principles laid down</strong></p>
      <p>which apply to every condition of life, and to every duty that God requires at our hands. Christ had come to
          magnify and make honorable the law that He Himself had proclaimed from Mount Sinai to His chosen people during
          their wilderness wandering....</p>
      <p>In all His lessons, Christ sought to impress upon the minds and hearts of His hearers the principles which
          underlie His great standard of righteousness. He taught them that if they would keep God’s commandments, love
          for God and for their fellow men must be manifested in their daily life. He sought to instill into their
          hearts the love He felt for humanity. Thus He sowed the seeds of truth, the fruits of which will produce a
          rich harvest of holiness and beauty of character. The holy inﬂuence will not only be <nobr>far-reaching</nobr>
          while time shall last, but its results will be felt throughout eternity. It will sanctify the actions, and
          have a purifying inﬂuence wherever it exists.</p>
      <p>Seated upon the mount, surrounded by His disciples and a large ... gathering, Jesus “opened his mouth, and
          taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” These are not
          murmurers and complainers, but those who are content with their condition and surroundings in life. They do
          not cherish the feeling that they deserve a better position than that which Providence has assigned them, but
          manifest a spirit of gratitude for every favor bestowed upon them. Every proud thought and exalted feeling is
          banished....</p>
      <p>Those who are truly sanctiﬁed have a sense of their own weakness. Feeling their need, they will go for light
          and grace and strength to Jesus, in whom all fullness dwells, and who alone can supply their wants. Conscious
          of their own imperfections, they seek to become more like Christ, and to live in accordance with the
          principles of His holy law. This continual sense of inefﬁciency will lead to such entire dependence upon God,
          that His Spirit will be exempliﬁed in them. The treasures of heaven will be opened to supply the wants of
          every hungering, thirsting soul. All of this character have the assurance of one day beholding the glory of
          that kingdom which as yet the imagination can only faintly grasp....</p>
      <p>The standard the Christian is to keep before him is the purity and loveliness of Christ’s character. Day by day
          he may be putting on new beauties, and reﬂecting to the world more and still more of the divine
