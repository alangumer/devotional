    <h1>John Learned Well The Lessons Jesus Taught</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. Luke 9:56. Upon one occasion
          Christ sent messengers before Him unto a village of the Samaritans,</strong></p>
      <p>requesting the people to prepare refreshments for Himself and His disciples. But when the Saviour approached
          the town, He appeared to be passing on toward Jerusalem. This aroused the enmity of the Samaritans, and
          instead of sending messengers to invite and even urge Him to tarry with them, they withheld the courtesies
          which they would have given to a common wayfarer. Jesus never urges His presence upon any, and the Samaritans
          lost the blessing which would have been granted them had they solicited Him to be their guest.</p>
      <p>We may wonder at this uncourteous treatment of the Majesty of heaven, but how frequently are we who profess to
          be followers of Christ guilty of similar neglect. Do we urge Jesus to take up His abode in our hearts and in
          our homes? He is full of love, of grace, of blessing, and stands ready to bestow these gifts upon us; but,
          like the Samaritans, we are often content without them.</p>
      <p>The disciples were aware of the purpose of Christ to bless the Samaritans with His presence; and when they saw
          the coldness, jealousy, and disrespect shown to their Master, they were ﬁlled with surprise and indignation.
          James and John were especially stirred. That He whom they so highly reverenced should be thus treated seemed
          to them a crime too great to be passed over without immediate punishment. In their zeal they said, “Lord, wilt
          thou that we command ﬁre to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?” (Luke 9:54)....</p>
      <p>Jesus rebuked His disciples, saying, “Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not
          come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them” (verses 55, 56). John and his fellow disciples were in a school
          in which Christ was teacher. Those who were ready to see their own defects, and were anxious to improve in
          character, had ample opportunity. John treasured every lesson and constantly sought to bring his life into
          harmony with the Divine Pattern.</p>
      <p>The lessons of Jesus, setting forth meekness, humility, and love as essential to growth in grace, and a ﬁtness
          for his work, were of the highest value to John. These lessons are addressed to us as individuals and as
          brethren in the church, as well as to the ﬁrst disciples of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life,
          <nobr>57-59.</nobr></p>
