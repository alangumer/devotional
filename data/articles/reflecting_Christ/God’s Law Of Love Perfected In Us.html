      <p><strong>Chap. 59 - God’s Law Of Love Perfected In Us</strong></p>
      <p>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 1 John 4:12.</p>
      <p>The conditions of eternal life, under grace, are just what they were in <nobr>Eden—perfect</nobr>
          righteousness, harmony with God, perfect conformity to the principles of His law. The standard of character
          presented in the Old Testament is the same that is presented in the New Testament. This standard is not one to
          which we cannot attain. In every command or injunction that God gives there is a promise, the most positive,
          underlying the command. God has made provision that we may become like unto Him, and He will accomplish this
          for all who do not interpose a perverse will and thus frustrate His grace.</p>
      <p>With untold love our God has loved us, and our love awakens toward Him as we comprehend something of the length
          and breadth and depth and height of this love that passeth knowledge. By the revelation of the attractive
          loveliness of Christ, by the knowledge of His love expressed to us while we were yet sinners, the stubborn
          heart is melted and subdued, and the sinner is transformed and becomes a child of heaven. God does not employ
          compulsory measures; love is the agent which He uses to expel sin from the heart. By it He changes pride into
          humility, and enmity and unbelief into love and faith....</p>
      <p>He tells us to be perfect as He is, in the same manner. We are to be centers of light and blessing to our
          little circle, even as He is to the universe. We have nothing of ourselves, but the light of His love shines
          upon us, and we are to reﬂect its brightness. “In His borrowed goodness good,” we may be perfect in our
          sphere, even as God is perfect in His.</p>
      <p>Jesus said, Be perfect as your Father is perfect. If you are the children of God you are partakers of His
          nature, and you cannot but be like Him. Every child lives by the life of his father. If you are God’s
          children, begotten by His Spirit, you live by the life of God. In Christ dwells “all the fullness of the
          Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9); and the life of Jesus is made manifest “in our mortal ﬂesh” (2 Corinthians
          4:11). That life in you will produce the same character and manifest the same works as it did in Him. Thus you
          will be in harmony with every precept of His law; for “the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul”
          (Psalm 19:7, margin). Through love “the righteousness of the law” will be “fulﬁlled in us, who walk not after
          the ﬂesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans <nobr>8:4).—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing,
