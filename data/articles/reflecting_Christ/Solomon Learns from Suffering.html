    <h1>Solomon Learns from Suffering</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child:
          I know not how to go out or come in.... Give therefore thy servant</strong></p>
      <p>an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad. 1 Kings
          <nobr>3:7-9.</nobr></p>
      <p>The discipline of David’s early experience was lacking in that of Solomon. In circumstances, in character, and
          in life, he seemed favored above all others. Noble in youth, noble in manhood, the beloved of his God, Solomon
          entered on a reign that gave high promise of prosperity and honor. Nations marveled at the knowledge and
          insight of the man to whom God had given wisdom. But the pride of prosperity brought separation from God. From
          the joy of divine communion Solomon turned to ﬁnd satisfaction in the pleasures of sense. Of this experience
          he says:</p>
      <p>“I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I made me gardens and orchards ...: I got
          me servants and maidens ...: I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasures of kings and of
          the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
          instruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
          Jerusalem.... And</p>
      <p>whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced
          in all my labour.”...</p>
      <p>“Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and,
          behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no proﬁt under the sun. And I turned myself to
          behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which
          hath been already done” (Ecclesiastes <nobr>2:4-12).</nobr></p>
      <p>“I hated life.... Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun” (verses 17,</p>
      <p>18).</p>
      <p>By his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the emptiness of a life that seeks in earthly things its highest
          good....</p>
      <p>In his later years, turning wearied and thirsting from earth’s broken cisterns, Solomon returned to drink at
          the fountain of life. The history of his wasted years, with their lessons of warning, he by the Spirit of
          inspiration recorded for after generations. And thus, although the seed of his sowing was repeated by his
          people in harvests of evil, the lifework of Solomon was not wholly lost. For him at last the discipline of
          suffering accomplished its work.</p>
      <p>But with such a dawning, how glorious might have been his life’s day, had Solomon in his youth learned the
          lesson that suffering had taught in other <nobr>lives!—Education,</nobr><nobr>152-154.</nobr></p>
