    <h1>Courtesy Should Reign in the Home</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let love be without dissimulation.... Be kindly affectioned one to another ...; in</strong></p>
      <p>honour preferring one another. Romans 12:9, 10.</p>
      <p>The principle inculcated by the injunction, “Be kindly affectioned one to another,” lies at the very foundation
          of domestic happiness. Christian courtesy should reign in every household.... The wife and mother may bind the
          hearts of her husband and children to her</p>
      <p>own by the strong cords of love, if in her intercourse with them she will manifest unvarying love in gentle
          words and courteous deportment.</p>
      <p>Marked diversities of disposition and character frequently exist in the same family; for it is in the order of
          God that persons of varied temperaments should associate together. When this is the case, each member of the
          household should sacredly regard the feelings and respect the rights of the others. By this means mutual
          consideration and forbearance will be cultivated, prejudices will be softened, and rough points of character
          smoothed. Harmony may be secured, and the blending of the varied temperaments may be a beneﬁt to each....</p>
      <p>[The true wife and mother] will perform her duties with dignity and cheerfulness, not considering it degrading
          to do with her own hands whatever it is necessary to do in a <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> household.</p>
      <p>In order to be a good wife, it is not necessary that woman’s nature should be utterly merged in that of her
          husband. Every individual has a life distinct from all others, an experience differing essentially from
          theirs. It is not the design of our Creator that our individuality should be lost in another’s; He would have
          us possess our own characters, softened and sanctiﬁed by His sweet grace. He would hear our words fresh from
          our own hearts. He would have our yearning desires and earnest cries ascend to Him marked by our own
          individuality. All do not have the same exercises of mind, and God calls for no secondhand experience. Our
          compassionate Redeemer reaches His helping hand to us just where we are.</p>
      <p>If woman looks to God for strength and comfort, and in His fear seeks to perform her daily duties, she will win
          the respect and conﬁdence of her husband, and see her children coming to maturity honorable men and women,
          having moral stamina to do right....</p>
      <p>When the mother has gained the conﬁdence of her children, and taught them to love and obey her, she has given
          them the ﬁrst lesson in the Christian life. They must love and trust and obey their Saviour, as they love and
          trust and obey their parents. The love which in faithful care and right training the parents manifest for the
          child faintly mirrors the love of Jesus for His faithful <nobr>people.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times,
          September 9, 1886.</p>
