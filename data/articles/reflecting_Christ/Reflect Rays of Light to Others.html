      <p><strong>Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. Hebrews 10:24.</strong></p>
      <p>The Christian pilgrim is not left to walk in darkness. Jesus leads the way. Those who follow Him walk in the
          sunshine of His presence. The path the pilgrim treads is clear and well deﬁned. Christ’s righteousness goes
          before <nobr>him—the</nobr> righteousness that makes possible the good works characterizing the life of every
          true Christian. God is his rearward. He walks in the light as Christ is in the light. As he travels onward in
          the Christian journey, he combines faith with earnest endeavor to win others to accompany him. Constantly
          receiving the light of Christ’s presence, constantly he reﬂects this light to others in words of encouragement
          and deeds of <nobr>self-denial.</nobr> He bears the sign of obedience to God’s law, which distinguishes him
          from those who are not following the pathway that leads to life eternal....</p>
      <p>He who walks in the light ... heeds the apostle’s admonition to provoke his fellow pilgrims to love and good
          works. Those who have a careful regard for one another’s needs, those who speak words of kindly sympathy,
          those who give thoughtful assistance to others, to help them in their work, encourage not only their fellow
          men, but themselves as well, because they thus become laborers together with God....</p>
      <p>Let us make straight paths, lest the lame be turned out of the way. Let no one follow a crooked path that
          someone else has made; for thus he would not only go astray himself, but would make this crooked path plainer
          for someone else to follow.... Determine that as for</p>
      <p>yourself, you will walk in the path of obedience. Know for a certainty that you are standing under the broad
          shield of Omnipotence. Realize that the characteristics of Jehovah must be revealed in your life, and that in
          you must be accomplished a work that will mold your character after the divine similitude. Yield yourself to
          the guidance of Him who is head over all....</p>
      <p>Talk light; walk in the light. “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” Study not how to please self.
          Lose sight of self, and behold the multitudes perishing in their sins. Gather to your souls the courage that
          can come only from the Light of the world. Forgetting self, help the many who are within reach around you.
          Talk faith, and your faith will increase.... Walk so that your life will reﬂect rays of light to others.
          Conﬁde in the love</p>
      <p>of Jesus, and you will have grace to save perishing souls. Your path will be as the path of the
          <nobr>just—a</nobr> “shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect <nobr>day.”—The</nobr> Signs
          of the Times, June 3, 1903.</p>
