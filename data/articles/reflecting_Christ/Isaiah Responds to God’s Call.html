    <h1>Isaiah Responds to God’s Call</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am
          I; send me. Isaiah 6:8.</strong></p>
      <p>In the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah was permitted in vision to look into the holy place, and into the
          holy of holies in the heavenly sanctuary. The curtains of the innermost sanctuary were drawn aside, and a
          throne high and lifted up, towering as it were to the very heavens, was revealed to his gaze. An indescribable
          glory emanated from a personage on the throne, and His train ﬁlled the temple, as His glory will ﬁnally ﬁll
          the earth. Cherubim were on either side of the mercy seat, ... and they glowed with the glory that enshrouded
          them from the presence of God.... These holy beings sang forth the praise and glory of God</p>
      <p>with lips unpolluted with sin.</p>
      <p>The contrast between the feeble praise which he had been accustomed to bestow upon the Creator and the fervid
          praises of seraphim astonished and humiliated the prophet. He had, for the time being, the sublime privilege
          of appreciating the spotless purity of Jehovah’s exalted character.... In the light of this matchless
          radiance, that made manifest all he could</p>
      <p>bear in the revelation of the divine character, his own inward deﬁlement stood out before him with startling
          clearness. His very words seemed vile to him.</p>
      <p>Thus when the servant of God is permitted to behold the glory of the God of heaven, as He is unveiled to
          humanity, and realizes to a slight degree the purity of the Holy One of Israel, he will make startling
          confessions of the pollution of his soul, rather than proud boasts of his holiness. In deep humiliation Isaiah
          exclaimed, “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips.” ...</p>
      <p>This is not that voluntary humility and servile <nobr>self-reproach</nobr> that so many seem to consider it a
          virtue to display. This vague mockery of humility is prompted by hearts full of pride and
          <nobr>self-esteem.</nobr> There are many who demerit themselves in words, who would be disappointed if this
          course did not call forth expressions of praise and appreciation from others. But the conviction of the
          prophet was genuine.... How could he go and speak to the</p>
      <p>people the holy requirements of Jehovah? ...</p>
      <p>While Isaiah was trembling and <nobr>conscience-smitten,</nobr> because of his impurity in the presence of this
          unsurpassed glory, he says, “Then ﬂew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he
          had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy
          lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom
          shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send <nobr>me.”—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          October 16, 1888.</p>
