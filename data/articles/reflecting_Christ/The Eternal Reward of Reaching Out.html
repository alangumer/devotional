      <p><strong>Chap. 243 - The Eternal Reward of Reaching Out</strong></p>
      <p>When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they
          cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. Luke 14:13, 14.</p>
      <p>It is the reward of Christ’s workers to enter into His joy. That joy, to which Christ Himself looks forward
          with eager desire, is presented in His request to His Father, “I will that they also, whom thou hast given me,
          be with me where I am.”</p>
      <p>The angels were waiting to welcome Jesus, as He ascended after His resurrection. The heavenly host longed to
          greet again their loved Commander, returned to them from the prison house of death. Eagerly they pressed about
          Him as He entered the gates of heaven. But He waved them back. His heart was with the lonely, sorrowing band
          of disciples whom He had left upon Olivet. It is still with His struggling children on earth, who have the
          battle with the destroyer yet to wage. “Father,” He says, “I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
          with me where I am.”</p>
      <p>Christ’s redeemed ones are His jewels, His precious and peculiar treasure. “They shall be as the stones of a
          <nobr>crown”—“the</nobr> riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.” In them “he shall see the
          travail of his soul, and shall be satisﬁed.”</p>
      <p>And will not His workers rejoice when they, too, behold the fruit of their labors? ...</p>
      <p>Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness and to God is noted in the books of heaven, and in the
          day of God everyone who has given himself as an instrument for the Holy Spirit’s working will be permitted to
          behold what his life has wrought.</p>
      <p>Wonderful will be the revealing as the lines of holy inﬂuence, with their precious results, are brought to
          view. What will be the gratitude of souls that will meet us in the heavenly courts, as they understand the
          sympathetic, loving interest which has been taken in their salvation! All praise, honor, and glory will be
          given to God and to the Lamb for our redemption; but it will not detract from the glory of God to express
          gratitude to the instrumentality He has employed in the salvation of souls ready to perish.</p>
      <p>The redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What
          blessed converse they have with these souls! “I was a sinner,” it will be said, ... “and you came to me, and
          drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope. And I believed in Him.” ... What rejoicing there
          will be as these redeemed ones meet and greet those who have had a burden in their behalf!— The Review and
          Herald, January 5, 1905.</p>
