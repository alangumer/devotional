    <h1>Nature Honors those Who Obey Her Laws</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not deﬁle himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor
          with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not deﬁle
          himself. Daniel 1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>We can have no right understanding of the subject of temperance until we consider it from a Bible standpoint.
          And nowhere shall we ﬁnd a more comprehensive and forcible illustration of true temperance and its attendant
          blessings than is afforded by the history of the prophet Daniel and his associates in the court of
          Babylon....</p>
      <p>It was not their own pride or ambition that had brought these young men into the king’s court, into the
          companionship of those who neither knew nor feared the true God. They were captives in a strange land, and
          Inﬁnite Wisdom had placed them where they were. They considered their position, with its difﬁculties and its
          dangers; and then, in the fear of God, made their decision. Even at the risk of the king’s displeasure, they
          would be true to the religion of their fathers. They obeyed the divine law, both natural and moral, and the
          blessing of God gave them strength and comeliness, and intellectual power.</p>
      <p>These youth had received a right education in early life; and now, when separated from home inﬂuences and
          sacred associations, they honored the instructors of their childhood. With their habits of
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> were coupled earnestness of purpose, diligence, and steadfastness. They had no time
          to squander in pleasure, vanity, or folly. They were not actuated by pride or unworthy ambition; but they
          sought to acquit themselves creditably, for the honor of their own downtrodden people and for His glory whose
          servants they were.</p>
      <p>God always honors the right. The most promising youth of every land subdued by the great conqueror had been
          gathered at Babylon; yet amid them all, the Hebrew captives were without a rival. The erect form, the ﬁrm,
          elastic step, the fair countenance showing that the blood was uncorrupted, the undimmed senses, the untainted
          <nobr>breath—all</nobr> were so many certiﬁcates of good habits, insignia of the nobility with which nature
          honors those who are obedient to her laws. And when their ability and acquirements were tested by the king at
          the close of the three years of training, none were found “like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.” Their
          keen apprehension, their choice and exact language, their extensive and varied knowledge, testiﬁed to the
          unimpaired strength and vigor of their mental powers.</p>
      <p>The history of Daniel and his companions has been recorded on the pages of the Inspired Word for the beneﬁt of
          all the youth of all succeeding <nobr>ages.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, February 11, 1886.</p>
