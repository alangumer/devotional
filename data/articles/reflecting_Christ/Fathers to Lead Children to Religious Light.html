    <h1>Fathers to Lead Children to Religious Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Psalm 127:1. What can we say to
          awaken the moral sensibilities of fathers, that they may understand</strong></p>
      <p>and undertake their duty to their offspring? The subject is of intense interest and importance, having a
          bearing upon the future welfare of our country. We would solemnly impress upon fathers, as well as mothers,
          the grave responsibility they have assumed in bringing children into the world. It is a responsibility from
          which nothing but death can free them. True, the chief care and burden rests upon the mother during the ﬁrst
          years of her children’s lives, yet even then the father should be her stay and counsel, encouraging her to
          lean upon his large affections, and assisting her as much as possible....</p>
      <p>In that great day of reckoning it will be asked him: Where are the children that I entrusted to your care to
          educate for Me, that their lips might speak My praise, and their lives be as a diadem of beauty in the world,
          and they live to honor Me through all eternity?</p>
      <p>In some children the moral powers strongly predominate. They have power of will to control their minds and
          actions. In others the animal passions are almost irresistible. To meet these diverse temperaments, which
          frequently appear in the same family, fathers, as well as mothers, need patience and wisdom from the divine
          Helper....</p>
      <p>The father should frequently gather his children around him, and lead their minds into channels of moral and
          religious light. He should study their different tendencies and susceptibilities, and reach them through the
          plainest avenues. Some may be best inﬂuenced through veneration and the fear of God; others through the
          manifestation of His benevolence and wise providence, calling forth their deep gratitude; others may be more
          deeply impressed by opening before them the wonders and mysteries of the natural world, with all its delicate
          harmony and beauty, which speak to their souls of Him who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and all
          the beautiful things therein.</p>
      <p>Children who are gifted with the talent or love of music may receive impressions that will be lifelong, by the
          judicious use of those susceptibilities as the medium for religious instruction.... Many may be reached best
          through sacred pictures, illustrating scenes in the</p>
      <p>life and mission of Christ....</p>
      <p>While there should be a uniformity in the family discipline, it should be varied to meet the wants of different
          members of the family. It should be the parents’ study ... to ... inspire them with a desire to attend to the
          highest intelligence and perfection of <nobr>character.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, December 20, 1877.</p>
