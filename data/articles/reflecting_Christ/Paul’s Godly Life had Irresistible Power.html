    <h1>Paul’s Godly Life had Irresistible Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. Isaiah
          26:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Nero pronounced the decision that condemned Paul to a martyr’s death....</p>
      <p>Few spectators were allowed to be present; for his persecutors, alarmed at the extent of his inﬂuence, feared
          that converts might be won to Christianity by the scenes of his death. But even the hardened soldiers who
          attended him listened to his words and with amazement saw him cheerful and even joyous in the prospect of
          death. To some who witnessed his martyrdom, his spirit of forgiveness toward his murderers and his unwavering
          conﬁdence in Christ till the last proved a savor of life unto life....</p>
      <p>The <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> peace expressed on Paul’s countenance won many a soul to the gospel. Paul carried
          with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who associated with him felt the inﬂuence of his union with Christ. The
          fact that his own life exempliﬁed the truth he proclaimed gave convincing power to his preaching.</p>
      <p>Here lies the power of truth. The unstudied, unconscious inﬂuence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon
          that can be given in favor of Christianity. Argument, even when unanswerable, may provoke only opposition; but
          a godly example has a power that it is impossible wholly to resist.</p>
      <p>The apostle lost sight of his own approaching sufferings in his solicitude for those whom he was about to leave
          to cope with prejudice, hatred, and persecution. The few Christians who accompanied him to the place of
          execution he endeavored to strengthen and encourage by repeating the promises given for those who are
          persecuted for righteousness’ sake. He assured them that nothing would fail of all that the Lord has spoken
          concerning His tried and faithful children.</p>
      <p>For a little season they might be in heaviness through manifold temptations; they might be destitute of earthly
          comforts; but they could encourage their hearts with the assurance of God’s faithfulness, saying, “I know whom
          I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him” (2 Timothy
          1:2). Soon the night of trial and suffering would end, and then would dawn the glad morning of peace and
          perfect day.</p>
      <p>The apostle was looking into the great beyond, not with uncertainty or dread, but with joyous hope and longing
          expectation. As he stands at the place of martyrdom he sees not the sword of the executioner or the earth so
          soon to receive his blood; he looks up through the calm blue heaven of that summer day to the throne of the
          <nobr>Eternal.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>509-512.</nobr></p>
