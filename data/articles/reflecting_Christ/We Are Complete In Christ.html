    <h1>We Are Complete In Christ</h1>

      <p><strong>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9.</strong></p>
      <p>When the sinner has a view of the matchless charms of Jesus, sin no longer looks attractive to him; for he
          beholds the Chiefest among ten thousand, the One altogether lovely. He realizes by a personal experience the
          power of the gospel, whose vastness of design is equaled only by its preciousness of purpose.</p>
      <p>We have a living Saviour. He is not in Joseph’s new tomb; He is risen from the dead and has ascended on high as
          a substitute and surety for every believing soul.... The sinner</p>
      <p>is justiﬁed through the merits of Jesus, and this is God’s acknowledgment of the perfection of the ransom paid
          for man. That Christ was obedient even unto the death of the cross is a pledge of the repenting sinner’s
          acceptance with the Father. Then shall we permit ourselves to have a vacillating experience of doubting and
          believing, believing and doubting? Jesus is the pledge of our acceptance with God. We stand in favor before
          God, not because of any merit in ourselves, but because of our faith “in the Lord our righteousness.”</p>
      <p>Jesus stands in the holy of holies, now to appear in the presence of God for us. There He ceases not to present
          His people moment by moment, complete in Himself. But because we are thus represented before the Father, we
          are not to imagine that we are to presume upon His mercy and become careless, indifferent, and
          <nobr>self-indulgent.</nobr> Christ is not the minister of sin. We are complete in Him, accepted in the
          Beloved, only as we abide in Him by faith.</p>
      <p>Perfection through our own good works we can never attain. The soul who sees Jesus by faith repudiates his own
          righteousness. He sees himself as incomplete, his repentance insufﬁcient, his strongest faith but feebleness,
          his most costly sacriﬁce as meager, and he sinks in humility at the foot of the cross. But a voice speaks to
          him from the oracles of God’s Word. In amazement he hears the message, “Ye are complete in him” (Colossians
          2:10). Now all is at rest in his soul. No longer must he strive to ﬁnd some worthiness in himself, some
          meritorious deed by which to gain the favor of God.</p>
      <p>Beholding the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world, he ﬁnds the peace of Christ; for pardon is
          written against his name, and he accepts the word of God, “Ye are complete in him.” How hard is it for
          humanity, long accustomed to cherish doubt, to grasp this great truth! But what peace it brings to the soul,
          what vital <nobr>life!—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, July 4, 1892.</p>
