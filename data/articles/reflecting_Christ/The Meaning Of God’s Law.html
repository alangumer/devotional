    <h1>The Meaning Of God’s Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. Psalm 19:7. The carnal mind is enmity against God,
          and it rebels against His will....</strong></p>
      <p>I have been shown what man is without a knowledge of the will of God.... But when</p>
      <p>the Spirit of God reveals to him the full meaning of the law, what a change takes place in his heart! Like
          Belshazzar, he reads intelligently the handwriting of the Almighty, and conviction takes possession of his
          soul. The thunders of God’s word startle him from his lethargy, and he calls for mercy in the name of Jesus.
          And to that humble plea God always listens with a willing ear. He never turns the penitent away
          comfortless....</p>
      <p>If God’s people would recognize His dealings with them and accept His teachings, they would ﬁnd a straight path
          for their feet and a light to guide them through darkness and discouragement. David learned wisdom from God’s
          dealings with him and bowed in humility beneath the chastisement of the Most High. The faithful portrayal of
          his true state by the prophet Nathan made David acquainted with his own sins and aided him to put them away.
          He accepted counsel meekly and humiliated himself before God. “The law of the Lord,” he exclaims, “is perfect,
          converting the soul.”</p>
      <p>Repentant sinners have no cause to despair because they are reminded of their transgressions and warned of
          their danger. These very efforts in their behalf show how much God loves them and desires to save them. They
          have only to follow His counsel and do His will, to inherit eternal life. God sets the sins of His erring
          people before them, that they may behold them in all their enormity under the light of divine truth. It is
          then their duty to renounce them forever.</p>
      <p>God is as powerful to save from sin today as He was in the times of the patriarchs, of David, and of the
          prophets and apostles. The multitude of cases recorded in sacred history where God has delivered His people
          from their own iniquities should make the Christian of this time eager to receive divine instruction and
          zealous to perfect a character that will bear the close inspection of the judgment....</p>
      <p>The words of inspiration comfort and cheer the erring soul. Although the patriarchs and apostles were subject
          to human frailties, yet through faith they obtained a good report, fought their battles in the strength of the
          Lord, and conquered gloriously. Thus may we trust in the virtue of the atoning sacriﬁce and be overcomers in
          the name of Jesus. Humanity is humanity the world over from the time of Adam down to the present generation,
          and the love of God through all ages is without a <nobr>parallel.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church
          <nobr>4:13-15.</nobr></p>
