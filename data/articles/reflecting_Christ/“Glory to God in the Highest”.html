    <h1>“Glory to God in the Highest”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory
          to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. Luke 2:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>I entreat you, my brethren and sisters, to make ... Christmas a blessing to yourselves and others. [The birth
          of Jesus] was celebrated by the heavenly host. Angels of God, in the appearance of a star, conducted the Wise
          Men on their mission in search of Jesus. They came with gifts and costly offerings of frankincense and myrrh,
          to pay their oblation to the infant King foretold in prophecy. They followed the brilliant messengers with
          assurance and great joy.</p>
      <p>The angels ... appeared to the humble shepherds, guarding their ﬂocks by night, upon Bethlehem’s plains. One
          angel ﬁrst appeared, clothed with the panoply of heaven; and so surprised and so terriﬁed were the shepherds
          that they could only gaze upon the wondrous glory of the heavenly visitant with unutterable amazement. The
          angel of the Lord came to them and said, “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.... For
          unto you</p>
      <p>is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” ...</p>
      <p>No sooner had their eyes become accustomed to the glorious presence of the one angel, than, lo! the whole plain
          was lighted up with the wondrous glory of the multitude of angels that peopled the plains of Bethlehem. The
          angel quieted the fears of the shepherds before opening their eyes to behold the multitude of the heavenly
          host, all praising God, and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward
          men.”</p>
      <p>Then was the melody of heaven heard by mortal ears, and the heavenly choir swept back to heaven as they closed
          their ever memorable anthem. The light faded away and the shadows of the night once more fell on the hills and
          plains of Bethlehem; but there remained in the hearts of the shepherds the brightest picture mortal man had
          ever looked upon, and the blessed promise and assurance of the advent to our world of the Saviour of men,
          which ﬁlled their hearts with joy and gladness, mingled with faith and wondrous love to <nobr>God.—The</nobr>
          Review and Herald, December 9, 1884.</p>
      <p>Those who love God should feel deeply interested in the children and youth. To them God can reveal His truth
          and salvation. Jesus calls the little ones that believe on Him the lambs of His ﬂock. He has a special love
          for and interest in the children....</p>
      <p>The most precious offering that the children can give to Jesus, is the freshness of their
          <nobr>childhood.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 17, 1889.</p>
