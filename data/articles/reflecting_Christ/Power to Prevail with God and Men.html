    <h1>Power to Prevail with God and Men</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. Genesis 32:30.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest danger of falling under the power of satanic
          delusions and the decree to compel the conscience. And even if they endure the test they will be plunged into
          deeper distress and anguish in the time of trouble, because they have never made it a habit to trust in God.
          The lessons of faith which they have neglected they will be forced to learn under a terrible pressure of
          discouragement.</p>
      <p>We should now acquaint ourselves with God by proving His promises. Angels record every prayer that is earnest
          and sincere. We should rather dispense with selﬁsh gratiﬁcations than neglect communion with God. The deepest
          poverty, the greatest <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> with His approval, is better than riches, honors, ease, and
          friendship without it. We must take time to pray. If we allow our minds to be absorbed by worldly interests,
          the Lord may give us time by removing from us our idols of gold, of houses, or of fertile lands.</p>
      <p>The young would not be seduced into sin if they would refuse to enter any path save that upon which they could
          ask God’s blessing. If the messengers who bear the last solemn warning to the world would pray for the
          blessing of God, not in a cold, listless, lazy manner, but fervently and in faith, as did Jacob, they would
          ﬁnd many places where they could say: “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” They would be
          accounted of heaven as princes, having power to prevail with God and with men....</p>
      <p>Now, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ.
          Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation.... Christ declared of
          Himself: “The prince of this world cometh,</p>
      <p>and hath nothing in me” (John <nobr>14:30).—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 622, 623.</p>
      <p>Were not miracles wrought by Christ and His apostles? The same compassionate Saviour lives today, and He is as
          willing to listen to the prayer of faith as when He walked visibly among men. The natural cooperates with the
          supernatural. It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would
          not bestow did we not thus <nobr>ask.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 525.</p>
      <p>No man is safe for a day or an hour without prayer.... While we must constantly</p>
      <p>guard against the devices of Satan, we should pray in faith continually: “Lead us not into
          <nobr>temptation.”—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 530.</p>
