    <h1>The Truly Sanctiﬁed Feel Unworthy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies.
          Daniel 9:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who experience the sanctiﬁcation of the Bible will manifest a spirit of humility. Like Moses, they have
          had a view of the awful majesty of holiness, and they see their own unworthiness in contrast with the purity
          and exalted perfection of the Inﬁnite One.</p>
      <p>The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctiﬁcation. His long life was ﬁlled with noble service for his
          Master. He was a man “greatly beloved” (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming to be pure and holy,
          this honored prophet identiﬁed himself with the really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of
          his people: “We do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great
          mercies.” “We have sinned, we have done wickedly” (chap. 9:18, 15)....</p>
      <p>When Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he exclaimed: “I abhor myself, and repent in dust
          and ashes” (Job 42:6). It was when Isaiah saw the glory of the Lord, and heard the cherubim crying, “Holy,
          holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,” that he cried out, “Woe is me! for I am undone” (Isaiah 6:3, 5). Paul,
          after he was caught up into the third heaven and heard things which it was not possible for a man to utter,
          speaks of himself as “less than the least of all saints” (2 Corinthians <nobr>12:2-4,</nobr> margin; Ephesians
          3:8)....</p>
      <p>There can be no <nobr>self-exaltation,</nobr> no boastful claim to freedom from sin, on the part of those who
          walk in the shadow of Calvary’s cross. They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that broke the
          heart of the Son of God, and this thought will lead them to <nobr>self-abasement.</nobr> Those who live
          nearest to Jesus discern most clearly the frailty and sinfulness of humanity, and their only hope is in the
          merit of a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour.</p>
      <p>The sanctiﬁcation now gaining prominence in the religious world carries with it a spirit of
          <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> and a disregard for the law of God that mark it as foreign to the religion of the
          Bible. Its advocates teach that sanctiﬁcation is an instantaneous work, by which, through faith alone, they
          attain to perfect holiness. “Only believe,” say they, “and the blessing is yours.” ... At the same time they
          deny the authority of the law of God, urging that they are released from obligation to keep the commandments.
          But is it possible for men to be holy, in accord with the will and character of God, without coming into
          harmony with the principles which are an expression of His nature and will, and which show what is well
          pleasing to <nobr>Him?—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 470, 471.</p>
