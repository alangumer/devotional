    <h1>Father as Priest; Mother as Teacher</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and reject not your mother’s teaching. Proverbs 1:8,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The love that was in the heart of Christ is to be in our hearts, that we may reveal it to those around us. We
          need to be daily strengthened by the deep love of God, and to let this love shine forth to those around
          us....</p>
      <p>Parents, you have a church in your home, and God demands that you bring into this church the grace of heaven,
          which is beyond computation, and the power of heaven, which is without measure. You can have this grace and
          this power if you will. But you must educate yourselves in accordance with your baptismal vows. When you took
          these vows, you pledged yourself, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that you would live
          unto God, and you have no right to break this pledge. The help of the three great powers is placed at your
          disposal.</p>
      <p>When in the name of Christ you ask for grace to overcome, it will be given unto you; for the promise is “Ask,
          and it shall be given you” (Matthew 7:7). Yes, seek God for aid. If you are in perplexity, do not go to your
          neighbors. Learn to carry your troubles to God. If you seek you will ﬁnd; if you knock, it shall be opened
          unto you. But this means faith, faith, faith. Exercise living faith in Christ....</p>
      <p>The father is the priest and the <nobr>house-band</nobr> of the home. The mother is the teacher of the little
          ones from their babyhood, and the queen of the household. Never is she to be slighted. Never are careless,
          indifferent words to be spoken to her before the children. She is their teacher. In thought and word and deed
          the father is to reveal the religion of Christ, that his children may see plainly that he has a knowledge of
          what it means to be a Christian....</p>
      <p>In our work we are not to strive to make an appearance. We are to look upon Christ, beholding what manner of
          love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. And what a joy, what a power,
          will be with us as we do this! It will not be merely the excitement of feeling, but a deep abiding joy. We are
          to present the solid truths of the Word of God, that these truths may be impressed on the hearts of the
          people, and that men and women may be led to walk in the footsteps of the Redeemer....</p>
      <p>I pray that your eyes may be anointed with the heavenly eyesalve, that you may discern what is truth and what
          is error. We need to put on the white garments of Christ’s righteousness. We need to walk and talk with
          <nobr>God.—Manuscript</nobr> 66, 1905.</p>
