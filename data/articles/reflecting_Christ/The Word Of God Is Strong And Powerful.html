    <h1>The Word Of God Is Strong And Powerful</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword. Hebrews
          4:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The Word of God is to be our spiritual food. “I am that bread of life” (John 6:48), Christ said.... The world
          is perishing for want of pure, unadulterated truth. Christ is the truth. His</p>
      <p>words are truth, and they have a deeper signiﬁcance than appears on the surface, and a value beyond their
          unpretending appearance. Minds that are quickened by the Holy Spirit will discern the value of these words.
          When our eyes are anointed with the holy eyesalve, we shall be able to detect the precious gems of truth, even
          though they may be buried beneath the surface.</p>
      <p>Truth is delicate, reﬁned, elevated. When it molds the character, the soul grows under its divine inﬂuence.
          Every day the truth is to be received into the heart. Thus we eat Christ’s words, which He declares are spirit
          and life. The acceptance of truth will make every receiver a child of God, an heir of heaven. Truth that is
          cherished in the heart is not a cold, dead letter, but a living power.</p>
      <p>Truth is sacred, divine. It is stronger and more powerful than anything else in the formation of a character
          after the likeness of Christ. In it there is fullness of joy. When it is cherished in the heart, the love of
          Christ is preferred to the love of any human being. This is Christianity. This is the love of God in the soul.
          Thus pure, unadulterated truth occupies the citadel of the being. The words are fulﬁlled, “A new heart also
          will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.” There is a nobleness in the life of the one who
          lives and works under the vivifying inﬂuence of the truth....</p>
      <p>Many are supposed to be converted who will not stand the stress of trial and temptation.... They have no depth
          of spiritual experience. They do not apply the truth</p>
      <p>to the heart and conscience.... There is a lack of <nobr>pure-toned</nobr> piety; and this lack makes them</p>
      <p>weaklings in the army of the Lord, when they might be giants if they were but willing to be truly
          converted....</p>
      <p>We are living in perilous times. In the fear of God I tell you that the true exposition of the Scriptures is
          necessary for the correct moral development of our characters. When mind and heart are controlled by the Holy
          Spirit, when self is dead, the truth is capable of constant expansion and development. When the truth as it is
          in Jesus molds our characters, it will be seen to be truth indeed. As it is contemplated by the believer, it
          will grow brighter, shining with its original beauty. It will increase in value, quickening and vivifying the
          mind.... It</p>
      <p>will elevate our aspirations, enabling us to reach the perfect standard of holiness.— The Review and Herald,
          February 14, 1899.</p>
