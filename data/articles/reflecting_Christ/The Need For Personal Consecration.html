    <h1>The Need For Personal Consecration</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
          labour is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Corinthians 15:58.</strong></p>
      <p>There is great need of the Holy Spirit’s inﬂuence in our midst. There must be an individual work done in the
          breaking of stubborn hearts. There needs to be deep <nobr>heart-searching,</nobr> that will lead to confession
          of sin. Believers should at this time stand with softened, sanctiﬁed, broken hearts, every sin confessed in
          repentance that needeth not to be repented of. The Holy Spirit is waiting to kindle in the heart the love of
          God, that His praise may be spoken from lips that are true, unselﬁsh, clean, and honest. When holy principles
          guide the life, the soul will be beautiful in its simplicity.</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of the prayer of faith is as <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> as eternity. The Lord will bless all who
          will seek Him with the whole heart, and who with humble souls and earnest purpose strive to follow the example
          of Christ. To those who thus seek to become partakers of the divine nature, the words are spoken, “Be not
          weary in well doing,” “always abounding in the work of the Lord.” He who labors in faith and humility, holding
          fast to the promises of God, will prevail. The greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven will be given
          to the faithful, believing children of God....</p>
      <p>I am instructed to urge the necessity of personal consecration and sanctiﬁcation of the whole being to God. Let
          each soul inquire, Lord, what wouldst Thou have me to do, that the vigilance of Christ may be seen in my life,
          and that His example may be copied by me, and that I may speak sincere words that will help souls who are in
          darkness and sin? ...</p>
      <p>Every individual is under obligation to give to others the truth he possesses. Nothing should be allowed to
          keep the servant of Christ from letting his light shine forth to his fellow men.... We should be daily
          increasing in ability to do the precious work of winning souls</p>
      <p>to Christ. This is such a precious work, such a satisfying work! And all heaven is waiting for channels through
          which can be poured the heavenly oil to refresh and strengthen needy souls. The Lord will protect and guide
          those who will let His divine fullness ﬂow from their lips in grateful praise, and who labor, through deeds of
          charity and love, to bless mankind. Such workers will become consecrated agents for God.</p>
      <p>I would say to every believer, Bring the spirit of heavenly grace into your soul, into your experience: this is
          the impress of the character of Christ.... And your reward for service will</p>
      <p>be found in the reﬂection of the tender spirit of Christ in your own <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          February 25, 1909.</p>
