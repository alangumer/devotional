    <h1>Christ’s Purpose to Sanctify and Cleanse the Church</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in
          heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened
          with might by his Spirit in the inner man. Ephesians <nobr>3:14-16.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>He [Christ] declares, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” This unlimited power it is our
          privilege to claim.</p>
      <p>The glory of God is His character. While Moses was in the mount, earnestly interceding with God, he prayed, “I
          beseech thee, shew me thy glory.” In answer God declared, “I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I
          will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee.” ...</p>
      <p>The glory of <nobr>God—His</nobr><nobr>character—was</nobr> then revealed: “The Lord passed by before him, and
          proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
          keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
          guilty.”</p>
      <p>This character was revealed in the life of Christ. That He might by His own example condemn sin in the ﬂesh, He
          took upon Himself the likeness of sinful ﬂesh. Constantly He beheld the character of God; constantly He
          revealed this character to the world.</p>
      <p>Christ desires His followers to reveal in their lives this same character....</p>
      <p>Today it is still His purpose to sanctify and cleanse His church “with the washing of water by the word, that
          he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.” ... No
          greater gift than the character that He revealed can Christ ask His Father to bestow upon those who believe on
          Him. What largeness there is in His request! What fullness of grace every follower of Christ has the privilege
          of receiving!</p>
      <p>God works with those who properly represent His character. Through them His will is done on earth as it is done
          in heaven. Holiness leads its possessor to be fruitful, abounding in every good work. He who has the mind that
          was in Christ never becomes weary in <nobr>well-doing.</nobr> Instead of expecting promotion in this life, he
          looks forward to the time when the Majesty of heaven shall exalt the sanctiﬁed ones to His throne....</p>
      <p>O that we might more fully appreciate the honor Christ confers upon us! By wearing His yoke and learning of
          Him, we become like Him in aspiration, in meekness and lowliness, in fragrance of character, and unite with
          Him in ascribing praise and honor and glory to God as <nobr>supreme.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September
          3, 1902.</p>
