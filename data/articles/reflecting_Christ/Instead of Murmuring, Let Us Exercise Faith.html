    <h1>Instead of Murmuring, Let Us Exercise Faith</h1>

      <p><strong>Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufﬁceth us. John 14:8. Shortly before Christ’s
          ascension, Philip said to Him, “Lord, shew us the Father, and it</strong></p>
      <p>sufﬁceth us.” Grieved at his unbelief, Christ turned to him, saying, “Have I been so long time with you, and
          yet hast thou not known me, Philip?” Is it possible that I have walked with you, and talked with you, and fed
          you by miracles, and yet you have not comprehended that I was the Sent of God, “the way, the truth, and the
          life,” that I came from heaven to represent the Father?</p>
      <p>“Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not
          of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.” “He that hath seen me hath seen the
          Father, for I am the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person.” ...</p>
      <p>Too often we grieve the heart of Jesus by our unbelief. Our faith is shortsighted, and we allow trials to bring
          out our inherited and cultivated tendencies to wrong. When brought into strait circumstances, we dishonor God
          by murmuring and complaining. Instead of this we should show that we have learned in the school of Christ, by
          helping those that are worse off than ourselves, those who are seeking for light, but are unable to ﬁnd it.
          Such have a special claim upon our sympathy, but instead of trying to uplift them, we pass by on the other
          side, intent on our own interests or trials. If we do not show decided unbelief, we manifest a murmuring,
          complaining spirit.</p>
      <p>“O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” Christ has already proved Himself to be our
          <nobr>ever-present</nobr> Saviour. He knows all about our circumstances, and in the hour of trial can we not
          pray that God will give us His Holy Spirit to bring to our minds His many manifestations of power in our
          behalf? Can we not believe that He is as willing to help us as on former occasions? His past dealings with His
          servants are not to fade from our minds, but the remembrance of them is ever to strengthen and uphold us.</p>
      <p>No amount of tribulation can separate us from Christ. If He leads us to Rephidim, it is because He sees that it
          is for our good and for His name’s glory. If we will look to Him in trusting faith, He will, in His own time,
          turn the bitterness of Marah into sweetness. He can open the ﬂinty rock, and cause cooling streams to ﬂow
          forth. Then shall we not lift our voices in praise and thanksgiving for past mercies, and go forward with full
          assurance that He is an <nobr>ever-present</nobr> help in time of <nobr>trouble?—The</nobr> Signs of the
          Times, September 17, 1896.</p>
