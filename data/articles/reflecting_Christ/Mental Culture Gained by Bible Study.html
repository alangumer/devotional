    <h1>Mental Culture Gained by Bible Study</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By knowledge shall the chambers be ﬁlled with all precious and pleasant riches. Proverbs
          24:4.</strong></p>
      <p>For the mind and the soul, as well as for the body, it is God’s law that strength is acquired by effort. It is
          exercise that develops. In harmony with this law, God has provided in His Word the means for mental and
          spiritual development.</p>
      <p>The Bible contains all the principles that men need to understand in order to be ﬁtted either for this life or
          the life to come. And these principles may be understood by all. No one with a spirit to appreciate its
          teaching can read a single passage from the Bible without gaining from it some helpful thought. But the most
          valuable teaching of the Bible is not to be gained by occasional or disconnected study. Its great system of
          truth is not so presented as to be discerned by the hasty or careless reader.... The truths that go to make up
          the great</p>
      <p>whole must be searched out and gathered up, “here are little, and there are little” (Isaiah 28:10).</p>
      <p>When thus searched and brought together, they will be found to be perfectly ﬁtted to one another. Each Gospel
          is a supplement to the others, every prophecy and explanation of another, every truth a development of some
          other truth. The types of the Jewish economy are made plain by the gospel. Every principle in the Word of God
          has it place, every fact its bearing. And the complete structure, in design and execution, bears testimony to
          its Author. Such a structure no mind but that of the Inﬁnite could conceive or fashion.</p>
      <p>In searching out the various parts and studying their relationship, the highest faculties of the human mind are
          called into intense activity. No one can engage in such study without developing mental power.</p>
      <p>And not alone in searching out truth and bringing it together does the mental value of Bible study consist. It
          consists also in the effort required to grasp the themes presented. The mind occupied with commonplace matters
          only, becomes dwarfed and enfeebled. If never tasked to comprehend grand and <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> truths,
          it after a time loses the power of growth. As a safeguard against this degeneracy, and a stimulus to
          development, nothing else can equal the study of God’s Word.</p>
      <p>As a means of intellectual training, the Bible is more effective than any other book, or all other books
          combined.... No other study can impart such mental power as does the effort</p>
      <p>to grasp the stupendous truths of revelation. The mind thus brought in contact with the thoughts of the Inﬁnite
          cannot but expand and <nobr>strengthen.—Education,</nobr> 123, 124.</p>
