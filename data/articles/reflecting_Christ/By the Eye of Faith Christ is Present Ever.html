    <h1>By the Eye of Faith Christ is Present Ever</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
          Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. John 16:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ said, “It is expedient for you that I go away.” No one could then have any preference because of his
          location or personal contact with Christ. The Saviour would be accessible to all alike, spiritually, and in
          this sense He would be nearer to us all than if He had not ascended on high. Now all may be equally favored by
          beholding Him and reﬂecting His character. The eye of faith sees Him ever present, in all His goodness, grace,
          forbearance, courtesy, and love, those spiritual and divine attributes. And as we behold, we are changed into
          His likeness.</p>
      <p>Christ is soon coming in the clouds of heaven, and we must be prepared to meet Him, not having spot or wrinkle
          or any such thing. We are now to accept the invitation of Christ. He says, “Come unto me, all ye that labour
          and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
          in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls.” The words of Christ to Nicodemus are of practical value to
          us today: “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That
          which is born of the ﬂesh is ﬂesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto
          thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst
          not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”</p>
      <p>The converting power of God must be upon our hearts. We must study the life of Christ, and imitate the divine
          Pattern. We must dwell upon the perfection of His character, and be changed into His image. No one will enter
          the kingdom of God unless his will is brought into captivity to the will of Christ.</p>
      <p>Heaven is free from all sin, from all deﬁlement and impurity; and if we would live in its atmosphere, if we
          would behold the glory of Christ, we must be pure in heart, perfect in character through His grace and
          righteousness. We must not be taken up with pleasure and amusement, but be ﬁtting up for the glorious mansions
          Christ has gone to prepare for us. If we are faithful, seeking to bless others, patient in
          <nobr>well-doing,</nobr> at His coming Christ will crown us with glory, honor, and immortality.— The Review
          and Herald, December 5, 1912.</p>
