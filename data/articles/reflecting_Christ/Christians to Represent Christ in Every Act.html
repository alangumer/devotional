    <h1>Christians to Represent Christ in Every Act</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. 2 Thessalonians 3:13.</strong></p>
      <p>What can we say to arouse those who profess to be the followers of Christ, to a sense of the solemn
          responsibilities resting upon them? Is there no voice that shall arouse them to work while the day lasts? Our
          divine Master gave His life for a ruined world. Who will deny self, and make some sacriﬁce to save souls for
          whom He died?</p>
      <p>In every act of life, Christians should seek to represent <nobr>Christ—seek</nobr> to make His service appear
          attractive. Let none make religion repulsive by groans and sighs and a relation of their trials, their
          <nobr>self-denials,</nobr> and sacriﬁces. Do not give the lie to your profession of faith by impatience,
          fretfulness, and repining. Let the graces of the Spirit be manifested in kindness, meekness, forbearance,
          cheerfulness, and love. Let it be seen that the love of Christ is an abiding motive; that your religion is not
          a dress to be put off and on to suit circumstances, but a principle, calm, steady, unvarying. Alas that pride,
          unbelief, and selﬁshness, like a foul cancer, are eating out vital godliness from the heart of many a
          professed Christian! ...</p>
      <p>Love to Jesus will be seen, will be felt. It cannot be hidden. It exerts a wondrous power. It makes the timid
          bold, the slothful diligent, the ignorant wise. It makes the stammering tongue eloquent, and rouses the
          dormant intellect into new life and vigor. It makes the desponding hopeful, the gloomy joyous. Love to Christ
          will lead its possessor to accept responsibilities for His sake, and to bear them in His strength. Love to
          Christ will not be dismayed by tribulation, nor turned aside from duty by reproaches....</p>
      <p>Peace in Christ is of more value than all the treasures of earth. Let us seek the Lord with all our heart, let
          us learn of Christ to be meek and lowly, that we may ﬁnd rest of soul. Let us arouse our dormant energies, and
          become active, earnest, fervent. The very example and deportment, as well as the words, of the Christian
          should be such as to awaken in the sinner a desire to come to the Fountain of life.</p>
      <p>Then let us open our hearts to the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Let us work cheerfully, joyfully,
          in the service of our Master. Let us praise Him, not only by our words in the congregation of His saints, but
          by a <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life and godly <nobr>conversation—a</nobr> life of active, noble Christian
          effort. Let us give diligence to make our calling and election sure, remembering that we shall triumph at
          last, if we do not become weary in well <nobr>doing.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 24, 1886.</p>
