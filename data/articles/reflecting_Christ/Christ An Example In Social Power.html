    <h1>Christ An Example In Social Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also
          together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. Mark 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>All who profess to be children of God should bear in mind that as missionaries they will be brought into
          contact with all classes of minds. There are the reﬁned and the coarse, the humble and the proud, the
          religious and the skeptical, the educated and the ignorant, the rich and the poor. These varied minds cannot
          be treated alike; yet all need kindness and sympathy. By mutual contact our minds should receive polish and
          reﬁnement. We are dependent upon one another, closely bound together by the ties of human brotherhood....</p>
      <p>It is through the social relations that Christianity comes in contact with the world. Every man or woman who
          has received the divine illumination is to shed light on the dark pathway of those who are unacquainted with
          the better way. Social power, sanctiﬁed by the Spirit of Christ, must be improved in bringing souls to the
          Saviour. Christ is not to be hid away in the heart as a coveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed
          solely by the possessor. We are to have Christ in us as a well of water, springing up into everlasting life,
          refreshing all who come in contact with <nobr>us.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, 495, 496.</p>
      <p>Christ did not refuse to mingle with others in friendly intercourse. When invited to a feast by Pharisee or
          publican, He accepted the invitation. On such occasions every word that He uttered was a savor of life unto
          life to His hearers; for He made the dinner hour an occasion of imparting many precious lessons adapted to
          their needs. Christ thus taught His disciples how to conduct themselves when in the company of those who were
          not religious as well as of those who were. By His own example He taught them that, [in] any public gathering,
          their conversation need not be of the same character as that usually indulged in on such occasions....</p>
      <p>If Christ is abiding in the soul there will come forth from the treasure house of the heart words which are
          pure and uplifting; if Christ is not abiding there, a satisfaction will be found in frivolity, in jesting and
          joking, which is a hindrance to spiritual growth and a cause of grief to the angels of God. The tongue is an
          unruly member, but it should not be so. It should be converted; for the talent of speech is a very precious
          talent. Christ is ever ready to impart of His riches, and we should gather the jewels that come from Him,
          that, when we speak, these jewels may drop from our <nobr>lips.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 6:173,
          174.</p>
