    <h1>Success Through House-to-House Ministry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I kept back nothing that was proﬁtable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly,
          and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith
          toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 20:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>The work ... has had to commence small; but ... it can be managed so as to become <nobr>self-sustaining.</nobr>
          One great means by which this can be accomplished will be by the <nobr>well-directed</nobr> efforts of those
          already in the truth to bring in others who will be a strength and support to the work. This was the way the
          Christian church was established. Christ ﬁrst selected a few persons, and bade them follow Him. Then they went
          in search of their relatives and acquaintances and brought them to Christ. This is the way we are to labor. A
          few souls brought out and fully established on the truth will, like the ﬁrst disciples, be laborers for
          others.... The burden now is to convince souls of the truth. This can best be</p>
      <p>done by personal efforts, by bringing the truth into their houses, praying with them, and opening to them the
          <nobr>Scriptures.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 8, 1885.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour went from house to house, healing the sick, comforting the mourners, soothing the afﬂicted,
          speaking peace to the disconsolate. He took the little children in His arms and blessed them and spoke words
          of hope and comfort to the weary mothers. With unfailing tenderness and gentleness, He met every form of human
          woe and afﬂiction.</p>
      <p>Not for Himself, but for others did He labor. He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring
          hope and strength to all with whom He came in contact. And as men and women listened to the truths that fell
          from His lips ... hope sprang up in their hearts. In His teaching there was an earnestness that sent His words
          home with convicting <nobr>power.—Gospel</nobr> Workers, 188.</p>
      <p>Paul, as well as laboring publicly, went from house to house preaching repentance toward God and faith toward
          our Lord Jesus Christ. He met with men at their homes, and besought them with tears, declaring unto them the
          whole counsel of God. Jesus came in personal contact with men. He did not stand aloof and apart from those who
          needed His help.... We must come close to the hearts of those who need our ministry. We must open</p>
      <p>the Bible to the understanding, present the claims of God’s law, read the promises to the hesitating, urge the
          backward, arouse the careless, strengthen the <nobr>weak.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 24, 1888.</p>
      <p>Do not neglect speaking to your neighbors, and doing them all the kindness in your power.... We need to seek
          for the spirit that constrained the apostle Paul to go from house</p>
      <p>to house, pleading with tears, and teaching “repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
          <nobr>Christ.”—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.</p>
