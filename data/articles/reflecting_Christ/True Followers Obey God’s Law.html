      <p><strong>Sin is the transgression of the law. 1 John 3:4.</strong></p>
      <p>The desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> no divorce from the
          follies of the world, has made the doctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what saith the
          Word of God? Says the apostle James: “What doth it proﬁt, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and
          have not works? can faith save him? ... Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not
          Abraham our father justiﬁed by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith
          wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?... Ye see then how that by works a man is
          justiﬁed, and not by faith only” (James <nobr>2:14-24).</nobr></p>
      <p>The testimony of the Word of God is against this ensnaring doctrine of faith without works. It is not faith
          that claims the favor of Heaven without complying with the conditions upon which mercy is to be granted, it is
          presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation in the promises and provisions of the Scriptures....</p>
      <p>The commission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit and separates the soul from God. “Sin
          is the transgression of the law.” And “whosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath not seen him, neither
          known him” (1 John 3:6). Though John in his Epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to
          reveal the true character of that class who claim to be sanctiﬁed while living in transgression of the law of
          God. “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But
          whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected” (chap. 2:4, 5).</p>
      <p>Here is the test of every man’s profession. We cannot accord holiness to any man without bringing him to the
          measurement of God’s only standard of holiness in heaven and in earth. If men feel no weight of the moral law,
          if they belittle and make light of God’s precepts, if they break one of the least of these commandments, and
          teach men so, they shall be of no esteem in the sight of Heaven, and we may know that their claims are without
          foundation.</p>
      <p>And the claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence that he who makes this claim is far from holy. It is
          because he has no true conception of the inﬁnite purity and holiness of God or of what they must become who
          shall be in harmony with His character; because he has no true conception of the purity and exalted loveliness
          of Jesus, and the malignity and evil of sin, that man can regard himself as <nobr>holy.—The</nobr> Great
          Controversy, 472, 473.</p>

          <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Upward Look, 303.</p>
