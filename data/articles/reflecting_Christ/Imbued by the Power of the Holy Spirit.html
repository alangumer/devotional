    <h1>Imbued by the Power of the Holy Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me
          both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts
          1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>It is our privilege to preach the Word in the demonstration of the Spirit. It is the privilege of every soul to
          exercise faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. But pure spiritual life comes only as the soul surrenders itself to
          the will of God through Christ, the reconciling Saviour. It is our privilege to be worked by the Holy Spirit.
          Through exercise of faith we are brought into communion with Christ Jesus, for Christ dwells in the hearts of
          all who are meek and lowly. Theirs is a faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul, a faith that brings
          peace to the heart, and leads in the path of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr></p>
      <p>The promise is that if we follow on to know the Lord, we shall know that “his going forth is prepared as the
          morning.” It is essential that we have daily the converting grace of God in the heart, that all our words and
          deeds may give evidence that we are in submission to the mind and will of God. In doing with meekness and
          humility our appointed service, we are to reveal the converting power of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Then we
          become the Lord’s agencies to do His work.</p>
      <p>With humility and meekness and yet with great earnestness we are to render our service to God. Christ is our
          pattern, our example in all things. He was ﬁlled with the Spirit, and the Spirit’s power was manifested
          through Him, not by bodily movements, but by a zeal for good works.</p>
      <p>Among God’s people there is need of deep, thorough heart searching, that we may be able to understand what
          constitutes true religion. Christ is a wonderful educator. His life and words are based upon sound principles.
          His manner of teaching was very simple. He was fashioned after the divine similitude, and if we follow Him, we
          shall make no mistakes....</p>
      <p>Our lives must be hid with Christ in God. We must have a personal knowledge of Christ. Then only can we rightly
          represent Him before the world. Wherever we are, we must let our light shine forth to the glory of God in good
          works. This is the great, the important work of our lives. Those who are really under the inﬂuence of the Holy
          Spirit will reveal its power by a practical application of the eternal principles of truth. They will reveal
          that the holy oil is emptied from the two olive branches into the chambers of the soul temple. Their words
          will be imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit to soften and subdue the heart. It will be manifest that the
          words spoken are spirit and <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 352, 1908.</p>
