    <h1>Christ’s Followers To Do Greater Works Than He</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
          greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. John 14:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ did not mean that the disciples would make more exalted exertions than He had made, but that their work
          would have greater magnitude. He did not refer merely to miracle working, but to all that would take place
          under the agency of the Holy Spirit. “When the Comforter is come,” He said, “whom I will send unto you from
          the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: and ye also
          shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning” (John 15:26, 27).</p>
      <p>Wonderfully were these words fulﬁlled. After the descent of the Holy Spirit, the disciples were so ﬁlled with
          love for Him and for those for whom He died, that hearts were melted by the words they spoke and the prayers
          they offered. They spoke in the power of the Spirit; and under the inﬂuence of that power, thousands were
          converted.</p>
      <p>As Christ’s representatives, the apostles were to make a decided impression on the world. The fact that they
          were humble men would not diminish their inﬂuence, but increase it; for the minds of their hearers would be
          carried from them to the Saviour, who, though unseen, was still working with them. The wonderful teaching of
          the apostles, their words of courage and trust, would assure all that it was not in their own power that they
          worked, but in the power of Christ. Humbling themselves, they would declare that He whom the Jews had cruciﬁed
          was the Prince of life, the Son of the living God, and that in His name they did the works that He had
          done.</p>
      <p>In His parting conversation with His disciples on the night before the cruciﬁxion, the Saviour made no
          reference to the suffering that He had endured and must yet endure. He did not speak of the humiliation that
          was before Him, but sought to bring to their minds that which would strengthen their faith, leading them to
          look forward to the joys that await the overcomer. He rejoiced in the consciousness that He could and would do
          more for His followers than He had promised; that from Him would ﬂow forth love and compassion, cleansing the
          soul temple, and making men like Him in character; that His truth, armed with the power of the Spirit, would
          go forth conquering and to conquer.</p>
      <p>“These things I have spoken unto you,” He said, “that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have
          tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (chap. <nobr>16:33).—The</nobr> Acts of the
          Apostles, 22, 23.</p>
