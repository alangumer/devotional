    <h1>The Building Blocks of Noble Characters</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong,
          but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 1
          Corinthians <nobr>13:5-7,</nobr> R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Pleasant, kind, and <nobr>well-bred</nobr> Christians will have an inﬂuence for God and His truth; it cannot be
          otherwise. The light borrowed from Heaven will shed its brightening rays through them to the pathway of
          others, leading them to exclaim. “O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man whose strength is in thee.”</p>
      <p>The words we speak, our daily deportment, are the fruit growing upon the tree. If the fruit is sour and
          unpalatable, the rootlets of that tree are not drawing nourishment from a pure source. If our characters are
          meek and lowly, if our affections are in harmony with our Saviour, we will show that our life is hid with
          Christ in God, and we leave behind us a bright track. Our life will be in such marked contrast to that of
          unbelievers, that our associates will discern that we have been with Jesus and learned of Him.</p>
      <p>The Christian need not become a recluse; but while necessarily associating with the world, he will not be of
          the world. Christian politeness should be cultivated, and daily put in practice. That unkind word should be
          left unspoken; that selﬁsh disregard of the happiness of others should give place to thoughtful sympathy. True
          courtesy, blended with truth and justice, will make the life not only useful, but beautiful and fragrant with
          love and good works....</p>
      <p>Virtue, honesty, kindness, and faithful integrity make noble characters; those who possess these
          characteristics will win esteem, even of unbelievers, and their inﬂuence in the church will be very precious.
          We are required to be right in important matters; but faithfulness in little things will ﬁt us for higher
          positions of trust.</p>
      <p>On the part of many, there is a great lack of true courtesy. Much is said of the improvements that have been
          made since the days of the patriarchs; but those living in that age could boast of a higher state of
          reﬁnement, and of more true courtesy of manners, than are possessed by the people in this age of boasted
          enlightenment. Integrity, justice, and Christian kindness, blended, make a beautiful combination. Courtesy is
          one of the graces of the Spirit. It is an attribute of heaven.</p>
      <p>The angels never ﬂy into a passion, never are envious, selﬁsh, and jealous. No harsh or unkind words escape
          their lips. And if we are to be the companions of angels, we too must be reﬁned and courteous.... A Christian
          will cultivate that charity that is not easily</p>
      <p>provoked, that suffereth long and is kind, that hopeth all things, endureth all <nobr>things.—The</nobr> Signs
          of the Times, November 11, 1886.</p>
