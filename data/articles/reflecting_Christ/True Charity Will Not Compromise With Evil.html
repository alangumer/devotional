    <h1>True Charity Will Not Compromise With Evil</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. And ye
          know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 1 John 3:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>As the years went by and the number of believers grew, John labored with increasing ﬁdelity and earnestness for
          his brethren. The times were full of peril for the church. Satanic delusions existed everywhere. By
          misrepresentation and falsehood the emissaries of Satan sought to arouse opposition against the doctrines of
          Christ, and in consequence dissensions and heresies were imperiling the church. Some who professed Christ
          claimed that His love released them from obedience to the law of God. On the other hand, many taught that it
          was necessary to observe the Jewish customs and ceremonies; that a mere observance of the law, without faith
          in the blood of Christ, was sufﬁcient for salvation.</p>
      <p>Some held that Christ was a good man, but denied His divinity. Some who pretended to be true to the cause of
          God were deceivers, and in practice they denied Christ and His gospel. Living themselves in transgression,
          they were bringing heresies into the church. Thus many were being led into the mazes of skepticism and
          delusion.</p>
      <p>John was ﬁlled with sadness as he saw these poisonous errors creeping into the church. He saw the dangers to
          which the church was exposed, and he met the emergency with promptness and decision. The Epistles of John
          breathe the spirit of love. It seems as if he wrote with a pen dipped in love. But when he came in contact
          with those who were breaking the law of God, yet claiming that they were living without sin, he did not
          hesitate to warn them of their fearful deception....</p>
      <p>We are authorized to hold in the same estimation as did the beloved disciple those who claim to abide in Christ
          while living in transgression of God’s law. There exist in these last days evils similar to those that
          threatened the prosperity of the early church; and the teachings of the apostle John on these points should be
          carefully heeded. “You must have charity” is the cry heard everywhere, especially from those who profess
          sanctiﬁcation. But true charity is too pure to cover an unconfessed sin. While we are to love the souls for
          whom Christ died, we are to make no compromise with evil. We are not to unite with the rebellious and call
          this charity. God requires His people in this age of the world to stand for the right as unﬂinchingly as did
          John in opposition to <nobr>soul-destroying</nobr> errors.... His testimony in regard</p>
      <p>to the Saviour’s life and death was clear and forcible. Out of the abundance of a heart overﬂowing with love
          for the Saviour he spoke; and no power could stay his <nobr>words.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles,
          <nobr>553-555.</nobr></p>
