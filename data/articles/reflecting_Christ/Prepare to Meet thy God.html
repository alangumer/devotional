    <h1>Prepare to Meet thy God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the
          Lord. Zephaniah 1:14.</strong></p>
      <p>I am bidden to call upon the churches to awake out of sleep. We must contend with invisible, supernatural foes.
          We are to put on the whole armor of God, that we may be prepared for the battles we have daily to ﬁght.</p>
      <p>I call upon those who have received light and knowledge to pray most earnestly, and to come up “to the help of
          the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.” Who are these mighty foes? They are the powers who, in
          the days of Daniel, hindered the heavenly messengers from convincing the king of Persia of the work he was to
          do.</p>
      <p>Our work of heralding the second coming of Christ is similar to that of John the Baptist, the forerunner of
          Christ at His ﬁrst advent. We are to proclaim to the world the message, “The great day of the Lord is near.”
          “Prepare to meet thy God.” We are to do much more than we have yet done.</p>
      <p>Among us, as among the children of Israel when they were being led to the Promised Land, are many who, unless
          they can see clearly every step in advance, will not move at the command of God to “go forward.” They have but
          little faith, and but little of the spirit of <nobr>self-denial....</nobr></p>
      <p>There is room in the work of God for all who are ﬁlled with the spirit of <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> We have a
          solemn work before us. God is calling for men and women who are willing to experience travail of soul, men and
          women who are consecrated to His work. We need ...</p>
      <p>men who have a solid experience in the things of God, who, when they encounter difﬁculties, will hold ﬁrmly to
          the work, saying, We will not fail nor be discouraged. We want men who will strengthen and build up the work,
          not tear down and seek to destroy that which others are trying to do. We need men and women whom God can work,
          the fallow ground of whose heart has been broken up.</p>
      <p>We do not need workers who must be supported and carried by those who have long been in the faith.... We want
          workers who are not steeped in selﬁshness, those who are not</p>
      <p><nobr>self-sufﬁcient....</nobr></p>
      <p>Satan will always cooperate with those who are willing to betray sacred trusts. There are traitors, ... men who
          claim to be Sabbathkeepers, but who, instead of building up the work, hinder it by criticizing and falsely
          accusing their brethren.</p>
      <p>Oh, how many might do a noble work in <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> who are absorbed
          in the little things of life! They are blind and cannot see afar off. They make a world of an atom and an atom
          of a world. They have become shallow streams, because they do not impart to others the Water of
          <nobr>Life.—Manuscript</nobr> 173, 1898.</p>
