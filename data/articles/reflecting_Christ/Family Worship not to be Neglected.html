    <h1>Family Worship not to be Neglected</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Trust...in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. 1 Timothy 6:17. We should be much
          happier and more useful, if our homelife and social intercourse</strong></p>
      <p>were governed by the principles of the Christian religion, and illustrated the meekness and simplicity of
          Christ.... Let visitors see that we try to make all around us happy by our</p>
      <p>cheerfulness, sympathy, and love.</p>
      <p>While we endeavor to secure the comfort and happiness of our guests, let us not overlook our obligation to God.
          The hour of prayer should not be neglected for any consideration....</p>
      <p>At an early hour of the evening, when you can pray unhurriedly and understandingly, present your supplication,
          and raise your voices in happy, grateful praise. Let all who visit Christians see that the hour of prayer is
          the most sacred, the most precious, and the happiest hour of the day. Such an example will not be without
          effect.</p>
      <p>These seasons of devotion exert a reﬁning, elevating inﬂuence upon all who participate in them. Right thoughts
          and new and better desires will be awakened in the hearts of the most careless. The hour of prayer brings a
          peace and rest grateful to the weary spirit; for the very atmosphere of a Christian home is that of peace and
          restfulness.</p>
      <p>In every act the Christian should seek to represent his Master, to make His service appear attractive....</p>
      <p>Nine tenths of the trials and perplexities that so many worry over are either imaginary, or brought upon
          themselves by their own wrong course. They should cease to talk of these trials, and [cease] to magnify them.
          The Christian may commit every worriment, every disturbing thing to God. Nothing is too small for our
          compassionate Saviour to notice; nothing is too great for Him to carry.</p>
      <p>Then let us set our hearts and homes in order; let us teach our children that the fear of the Lord is the
          beginning of wisdom; and let us, by a cheerful, happy, <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life, express our gratitude
          and love to Him “who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.” But above all things, let us ﬁx our thoughts and
          the affections of our hearts on the dear Saviour who suffered for guilty man, and thus opened heaven for
          us.</p>
      <p>Love to Jesus cannot be hidden, but will make itself seen and felt. It exerts a wondrous power. It makes the
          timid bold, the slothful diligent, the ignorant wise. It makes the stammering tongue eloquent, and rouses the
          dormant intellect into new life and vigor. It makes the desponding hopeful, the gloomy joyous. Love to Christ
          will lead its possessor to accept responsibilities and cares for His sake, and to bear them in His
          <nobr>strength.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, December 17, 1885.</p>
