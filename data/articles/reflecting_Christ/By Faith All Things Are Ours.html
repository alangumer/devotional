    <h1>By Faith All Things Are Ours</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For all things are yours; ... and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s. 1 Corinthians
          <nobr>3:21-23.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Not only has the Son of God been given as a sacriﬁce for the guilty, as a Redeemer for the lost, but through
          Him all things are ours. Those who have faith in Christ, those who are obedient to His instruction, will know
          by experience the boundlessness of the power that gives us constant witness that we are Christ’s, and that
          Christ is ours. The Saviour has given us the charter of our inheritance, and we stand on vantage ground,
          because we have chosen Christ as our portion.</p>
      <p>Those who are obedient to His Word can receive this <nobr>evidence—the</nobr> assurance of the truth as it is
          in Jesus. If we will accustom our minds to dwell upon the facts of faith that have been given us, we may
          endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. Those who walk with Jesus may rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
          of glory....</p>
      <p>An abiding faith, a constant obedience, is essential to a continuance in His love.... We</p>
      <p>are to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the truth as it is in Jesus, the truth
          that is exempliﬁed in His character, will be expressed in our lives, in our spirit, our words, our temper.
          Truth will be the law of the mind. Christ will be formed within, the hope of glory.</p>
      <p>There is a peculiarly close union between the transformed soul and God. It is impossible to ﬁnd words to
          describe this union. It is a treasure worth inﬁnitely more to the true believer than gold and silver.</p>
      <p>The Christian sees the Saviour ever before him, and by beholding, he becomes changed into the same image, from
          glory to glory. He bears the signature of God. Shall we give this up for the science of sophistry? Never!
          Truth is full of Godlike richness. He who is a partaker of the divine nature will hold ﬁrm to the truth. He
          will never let go; for the truth holds him.</p>
      <p>Let us never forget that by the characters which we are forming day by day, we are deciding our future destiny.
          Those whose hearts are ﬁlled with the love of Christ will ﬁnd in the heavenly courts a glad reception....</p>
      <p>It is the spirituality of the children of God that is their glory in His eyes. This is the distinguishing mark
          that separates them from the world.... We are to hunger and thirst after</p>
      <p>righteousness, that we may represent Christ to the world. If His love abides in our hearts, it will be
          distinctly revealed. We shall be lights in the world. Christ calls upon every follower of His to reveal His
          virtues of character, to represent Him in word and deed, to make known His <nobr>love.—Manuscript</nobr> 84,
          1905.</p>
