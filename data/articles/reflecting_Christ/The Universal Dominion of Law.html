    <h1>The Universal Dominion of Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For he hath
          founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the ﬂoods. Psalm 24:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>Upon all created things is seen the impress of the Deity. Nature testiﬁes of God. The susceptible mind, brought
          in contact with the miracle and mystery of the universe, cannot but recognize the working of inﬁnite power.
          Not by its own inherent energy does the earth produce its bounties, and year by year continue its motion
          around the sun. An unseen hand guides the planets in their circuit of the heavens. A mysterious life pervades
          all <nobr>nature—a</nobr> life that sustains the unnumbered worlds throughout immensity, that lives in the
          insect atom which ﬂoats in the summer breeze, that wings the ﬂight of the swallow and feeds the young ravens
          which cry, that brings the bud to blossom, and the ﬂower to fruit.</p>
      <p>The same power that upholds nature is working also in man. The same great laws that guide alike the star and
          the atom control human life. The laws that govern the heart’s action, regulating the ﬂow of the current of
          life to the body, are the laws of the mighty Intelligence that has the jurisdiction of the soul. From Him all
          life proceeds. Only in harmony with Him can be found its true sphere of action. For all the objects of His
          creation the condition is the <nobr>same—a</nobr> life sustained by receiving the life of God, a life
          exercised in harmony with the Creator’s will. To transgress His law, physical, mental, or moral, is to place
          one’s self out of harmony with the universe, to introduce discord, anarchy, ruin.</p>
      <p>To him who learns thus to interpret its teachings, all nature becomes illuminated; the world is a lesson book,
          life a school. The unity of man with nature and with God, the universal dominion of law, the results of
          transgression, cannot fail of impressing the mind and molding the character....</p>
      <p>So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where this wonderful lesson book shall be
          open before him. Let him behold the glorious scenes painted by the great Master Artist upon the shifting
          canvas of the heavens, ... let him watch the unfolding mysteries of the changing seasons, and, in all His
          works, learn of the Creator.</p>
      <p>In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so ﬁrmly and surely laid. Yet even the child, as he
          comes in contact with nature, will see cause for perplexity. He cannot but recognize the working of
          antagonistic forces. It is here that nature needs an interpreter. Looking upon the evil manifest even in the
          natural world, all have the same sorrowful lesson to <nobr>learn—“An</nobr> enemy hath done this.” ... Only in
          the light that shines from Calvary can nature’s teaching be read aright.— Education, <nobr>99-101.</nobr></p>
