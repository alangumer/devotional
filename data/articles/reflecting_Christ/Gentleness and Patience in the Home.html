    <h1>Gentleness and Patience in the Home</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you. Isaiah 66:13, N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The home is a place where every heavenly grace may be developed. The Lord delights to dwell with those families
          who cultivate home religion, and with whom the spirit of praise and cheerfulness reigns. His people need to
          understand the principles that underlie the religion of Christ, and study how to make these principles the
          ruling element in the life. This will ﬁll the home with sunshine. The fruit of faith will be seen in true
          service for Christ.</p>
      <p>As those who profess to follow the meek and lowly Jesus, Christian parents should never permit temper to gain
          the mastery over them. Never should they strike their children in haste or anger. When they have done wrong,
          and you feel that they need correcting, take the matter to God in prayer. Kneeling before the Lord, tell your
          Father your grief because the Spirit of the Lord has been grieved. Seek for God’s blessing and guidance in the
          training of your children.... When through the aid of the divine Spirit parents succeed in turning</p>
      <p>their young hearts to Him, God and angels rejoice.</p>
      <p>Let parents remember that the example they set in the daily deportment, their children will follow.... Let them
          remember that scolding will accomplish nothing in the formation of</p>
      <p>Christian character. It will never bring about reformations, nor lead the youth to desire to become Christ’s
          chosen ones.</p>
      <p>By gentleness and patience, seek to win your children from wrong. Seek God for wisdom to train them so that
          they will love you and love God. When it is necessary to refuse them their desires, show them kindly that in
          doing this you are seeking their highest good. Love and cherish your children; but do not allow them to follow
          their own way, for this is the curse of the age in which we live. Show them where they make mistakes, and
          teach them that if they do not correct these wrongs, they can never be given a place in the mansions that
          Jesus is preparing for those who love Him. In this way you will retain their love and conﬁdence....</p>
      <p>Children and youth need the inﬂuence of a cheerful example. They need pleasant instruction.... By an example of
          patience and forbearance, the Christian parent is to teach</p>
      <p>that evil temper and harshness have no place in the life of the believer in Christ, that these qualities are
          displeasing to God. As your children see you bringing into your lives the principles of truth, they too will
          be led to ﬁght against wrong habits and practices, and with you will reﬂect the goodness and love of
          <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, November 14, 1911.</p>
