      <p><strong>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Philippians
          2:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Far more than we do, we need to understand the issues at stake in the conﬂict in which we are engaged. We need
          to understand more fully the value of the truths that God has given for this time and the danger of allowing
          our minds to be diverted from them by the great deceiver.</p>
      <p>The inﬁnite value of the sacriﬁce required for our redemption reveals the fact that sin is a tremendous evil.
          Through sin the whole human organism is deranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination corrupted. Sin has
          degraded the faculties of the soul. Temptations from without ﬁnd an answering chord within the heart, and the
          feet turn imperceptibly toward evil.</p>
      <p>As the sacriﬁce in our behalf was complete, so our restoration from the deﬁlement of sin is to be complete.
          There is no act of wickedness that the law will excuse; there is no unrighteousness that will escape its
          condemnation. The life of Christ was a perfect fulﬁllment of every precept of the law. He said, “I have kept
          my Father’s commandments” (John 15:10). His life is our standard of obedience and service.</p>
      <p>God alone can renew the heart. “It is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for His good pleasure”
          (Philippians 2:13, A.R.V.). But we are bidden: “Work out your own salvation” (verse 12, A.R.V.).</p>
      <p>Wrongs cannot be righted, nor can reformations in character be made, by a few feeble, intermittent efforts....
          The struggle for conquest over self, for holiness and heaven,</p>
      <p>is a lifelong struggle. Without continual effort and constant activity there can be no advancement in the
          divine life, no attainment of the victor’s crown.</p>
      <p>The strongest evidence of man’s fall from a higher state is the fact that it costs so much to return. The way
          of return can be gained only by hard ﬁghting, inch by inch, every hour. By a momentary act of the will, one
          may place himself in the power of evil; but it requires more than a momentary act of will to break these
          fetters and attain to a higher, holier life. The purpose may be formed, the work begun; but its accomplishment
          will require toil, time, and perseverance, patience and sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>Beset with temptations without number, we must resist ﬁrmly or be conquered.... Paul’s</p>
      <p>sanctiﬁcation was the result of a constant conﬂict with self. He said: “I die daily” (1 Corinthians 15:31). His
          will and his desires every day conﬂicted with duty and the will of God. Instead of following inclination, he
          did God’s will, however crucifying to his own nature. God leads His people on step by
          <nobr>step.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 8:312, 313.</p>
