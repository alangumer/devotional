    <h1>Gideon Shows Courtesy to the Ephraimites</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in
          comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. Judges 8:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Gideon returned from pursuing the enemies of the nation, to meet censure and accusation from his own
          countrymen. When at his call the men of Israel had rallied against the Midianites, the tribe of Ephraim had
          remained behind. They looked upon the effort as a perilous undertaking; and as Gideon sent them no special
          summons, they availed themselves of this excuse not to join their brethren. But when the news of Israel’s
          triumph reached them, the Ephraimites were envious because they had not shared it.</p>
      <p>After the rout of the Midianites, the men of Ephraim had, by Gideon’s direction, seized the fords of the
          Jordan, thus preventing the escape of the fugitives. By this means a large number of the enemy were slain,
          among whom were two princes, Oreb and Zeeb. Thus the men of Ephraim followed up the battle, and helped
          complete the victory. Nevertheless, they were jealous and angry, as though Gideon had been led by his own will
          and judgment. They did not discern God’s hand in the triumph of Israel, they did not appreciate His power and
          mercy in their deliverance....</p>
      <p>Returning with the trophies of victory, they angrily reproached Gideon: “Why hast thou served us thus, that
          thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to ﬁght with the Midianites?”</p>
      <p>“What have I done now, in comparison of you?” said Gideon. “Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better
          than the vintage of Abiezer? God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what
          was I able to do in comparison of you?”</p>
      <p>The spirit of jealousy might easily have been fanned into a quarrel that would have caused strife and
          bloodshed; but Gideon’s modest answer soothed the anger of the men of Ephraim, and they returned in peace to
          their homes. Firm and uncompromising where principle was concerned, and in war a “mighty man of valour,”
          Gideon displayed also a spirit of courtesy that is rarely witnessed.</p>
      <p>The people of Israel, in their gratitude at deliverance from the Midianites, proposed to Gideon that he should
          become their king, and that the throne should be conﬁrmed to his descendants. This proposition was in direct
          violation of the principles of the theocracy. God was the king of Israel, and for them to place a man upon the
          throne would be a rejection of their Divine Sovereign. Gideon recognized this fact; his answer shows how true
          and noble were his motives. “I will not rule over you,” he declared; “neither shall my son rule over you: the
          Lord shall rule over <nobr>you.”—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 554, 555.</p>
