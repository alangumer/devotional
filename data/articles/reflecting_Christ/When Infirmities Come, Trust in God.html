    <h1>When Inﬁrmities Come, Trust in God</h1>

      <p><strong>The Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall
          ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. Isaiah 12:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>Now when you can no longer be active, and inﬁrmities press upon you, all that God requires of you is to trust
          Him. Commit the keeping of your soul to Him as unto a faithful Creator. His mercies are sure, His covenant is
          everlasting. Happy is the man whose hope is in the Lord his God, who keepeth truth forever. Let your mind
          grasp the promises and hold to them. If you cannot call to mind readily the rich assurance contained in the
          precious promises, listen to them from the lips of another. What fullness, what love and assurance are found
          in these words from the lips of God Himself, proclaiming His Love, His pity and interest in the children of
          His care:</p>
      <p>“The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping
          mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin” (Exodus 34:6, 7).</p>
      <p>The Lord is full of compassion for His suffering ones. What sins are too great for His pardon? He is merciful,
          and as such is inﬁnitely more ready and more pleased to pardon than to condemn. He is gracious, not looking
          for wrong in us; He knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are but dust. In His boundless compassion and
          mercy He heals all our backslidings, loving us freely while we are yet sinners, withdrawing not His light, but
          shining on us for Christ’s sake.</p>
      <p>Will you ... always trust in Jesus, who is your righteousness? The love of God is shed abroad in your heart by
          the Holy Ghost, which is graciously given unto you. You are one with Christ. He will give you grace to be
          patient, He will give you grace to be trustful, He will give you grace to overcome restlessness, He will warm
          your heart with His own sweet Spirit, He will revive your soul in its weakness. Only a few days more to be as
          pilgrims and strangers in this world, seeking for a better country, even an heavenly. Our home is in heaven.
          Then stay your soul in conﬁdence upon God. Roll all your burdens upon Him.</p>
      <p>Oh, how many times has your heart been touched with the beauty of the Saviour’s countenance, charmed with the
          loveliness of His character, and subdued with the thought of His suffering. Now He wants you to lean your
          whole weight upon Him.... “And in that day</p>
      <p>thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and
          thou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid” (Isaiah 12:1,
          <nobr>2).—Selected</nobr> Messages, book 2, pp. 231, 232.</p>
