    <h1>Discipline Prepares Youth for High Destiny</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall
          preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee. Proverbs 2:10, 11.</strong></p>
      <p>Now, as in the days of Israel, every youth should be instructed in the duties of practical life. Each should
          acquire a knowledge of some branch of manual labor by which, if need be, he may obtain a livelihood. This is
          essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes of life, but from its bearing upon physical,
          mental, and moral development. Even if it were certain that one would never need to resort to manual labor for
          his support, still he should be taught to work. Without physical exercise, no one can have a sound
          constitution and vigorous health; and the discipline of <nobr>well-regulated</nobr> labor is no less essential
          to the securing of a strong and active mind and a noble character....</p>
      <p>Let the youth be led to understand the object of their creation, to honor God and bless their fellow men; let
          them see the tender love which the Father in heaven has manifested toward them, and the high destiny for which
          the discipline of this life is to prepare them, the dignity and honor to which they are called, even to become
          the sons of God, and thousands would turn with contempt and loathing from the low and selﬁsh aims and the
          frivolous pleasures that have hitherto engrossed them. They would learn to hate sin and to shun it, not merely
          from hope of reward or fear of punishment, but from a sense of its inherent baseness, because it would be a
          degrading of their <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers, a stain upon their Godlike manhood....</p>
      <p>The elements of character that make a man successful and honored among <nobr>men—the</nobr> irrepressible
          desire for some greater good, the indomitable will, the strenuous exertion, the untiring
          <nobr>perseverance—are</nobr> not to be crushed out. By the grace of God they are to be directed to objects as
          much higher than mere selﬁsh and temporal interests as the heavens are higher than the earth.</p>
      <p>And the education begun in this life will be continued in the life to come. Day by day the wonderful works of
          God, the evidences of His wisdom and power in creating and sustaining the universe, the inﬁnite mystery of
          love and wisdom in the plan of redemption, will open to the mind in new beauty.... Even in this life we may
          catch glimpses of His presence and</p>
      <p>may taste the joy of communion with heaven, but the fullness of its joy and blessing will be reached in the
          hereafter. Eternity alone can reveal the glorious destiny to which man, restored to God’s image, can
          <nobr>attain.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 601, 602.</p>
