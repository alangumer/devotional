    <h1>We Receive the Wisdom of Eternity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in
          learning. Proverbs 9:9.</strong></p>
      <p>As we cherish and obey the promptings of the Spirit, our hearts are enlarged to receive more and more of His
          power, and to do more and better work. Dormant energies are aroused, and palsied faculties receive new
          life.</p>
      <p>The humble worker who obediently responds to the call of God may be sure of receiving divine assistance. To
          accept so great and holy a responsibility is itself elevating to the character. It calls into action the
          highest mental and spiritual powers, and strengthens and puriﬁes the mind and heart. Through faith in the
          power of God, it is wonderful how strong a weak man may become, how decided his efforts, how proliﬁc of great
          results.</p>
      <p>He who begins with a little knowledge, in a humble way, and tells what he knows, while seeking diligently for
          further knowledge, will ﬁnd the whole heavenly treasure awaiting his demand. The more he seeks to impart
          light, the more light he will receive. The more one tries to explain the Word of God to others, with a love
          for souls, the plainer it becomes to himself. The more we use our knowledge and exercise our powers, the more
          knowledge and power we shall have.</p>
      <p>Every effort made for Christ will react in blessing upon ourselves. If we use our means for His glory, He will
          give us more. As we seek to win others to Christ, bearing the burden of souls in our prayers, our own hearts
          will throb with the quickening inﬂuence of God’s grace; our own affections will glow with more divine fervor;
          our whole Christian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.</p>
      <p>The value of man is estimated in heaven according to the capacity of the heart to know God. This knowledge is
          the spring from which ﬂows all power. God created man that every faculty might be the faculty of the divine
          mind; and He is ever seeking to bring the human mind into association with the divine. He offers us the
          privilege of cooperation with Christ in revealing His grace to the world, that we may receive increased
          knowledge of heavenly things.</p>
      <p>Looking unto Jesus we obtain brighter and more distinct views of God, and by beholding we become changed.
          Goodness, love for our fellow men, becomes our natural instinct. We develop a character which is the
          counterpart of the divine character. Growing into His likeness, we enlarge our capacity for knowing God. More
          and more we enter into fellowship with the heavenly world, and we have continually increasing power to receive
          the riches of the knowledge and wisdom of eternity. <nobr>—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons,
