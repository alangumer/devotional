    <h1>We Fight Life’s Battles in Christ’s Strength</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having
          done all, to stand. Ephesians 6:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Let everyone who names the name of Christ read this scripture again and again, and then inquire, Am I clothed
          with the whole armor of God, that I may be a successful colaborer with Christ? The more we know of ourselves,
          the more we probe our motives and desires, the more heartfelt will be our consciousness of our utter inability
          to ﬁght the battle of the Lord in our Own strength....</p>
      <p>Stablish your hearts in the belief that God knows of all the trials and difﬁculties you will encounter in the
          warfare against evil; for God is dishonored when any soul belittles His power by talking unbelief.</p>
      <p>This world is God’s great ﬁeld of labor; He has purchased those that dwell on it with the blood of His
          <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son, and He means that His message of mercy shall go to everyone. Those who are
          commissioned to do this work will be tested and tried, but they are always to remember that God is near to
          strengthen and uphold them. He does not ask us to depend upon any broken reed. We are not to look for human
          aid. God forbid that we should place man where God should be.... The Lord Jehovah is “everlasting
          strength.”</p>
      <p>A lesson of faith is given us in the experience of Christ with the disciples of John the Baptist. Imprisoned in
          the lonely dungeon, John had fallen into discouragement, and he sent his disciples to Jesus, asking, “Art thou
          he that should come, or do we look for another?” Christ knew on what errand these messengers had come, and by
          a mighty demonstration of His power He gave them unmistakable evidence of His divinity. Turning to the
          multitude, He spoke, and the deaf heard His voice. He spoke again, and the eyes of the blind were opened to
          behold the beauties of nature.... He put forth His hand, and at His touch the fever</p>
      <p>left the afﬂicted ones. At His command demoniacs were healed, and falling at His feet, worshipped Him. Then
          turning to the disciples of John, He said, “Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and
          see.”</p>
      <p>That same Jesus who wrought those mighty works, is our Saviour today, and is as willing to manifest His power
          on our behalf as He was in the behalf of John the Baptist. When we are hedged about by adverse circumstances,
          surrounded by difﬁculties which it seems impossible for us to surmount, we are not to murmur, but to remember
          the past loving kindnesses of the Lord. Looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, we may
          endure as seeing Him who is invisible, and this will keep our minds from being clouded by the shadow of
          <nobr>unbelief.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September 17, 1896.</p>
