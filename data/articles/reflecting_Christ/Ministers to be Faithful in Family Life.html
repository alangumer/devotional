    <h1>Ministers to be Faithful in Family Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. Proverbs
          22:6.</strong></p>
      <p>The father is the highest priest of the family. The souls of his wife and children, as God’s property, should
          be to him of the highest value, and he should faithfully guide the formation of their characters. The care of
          his children from their infancy should be his ﬁrst consideration; for it is for their present and eternal good
          that they develop right characters. He should carefully weigh his words and actions, considering their
          inﬂuence, and the results they may produce.</p>
      <p>He who is engaged in the work of the gospel ministry must be faithful in his family life. It is as essential
          that as a father he should improve the talents God has given him for the purpose of making the home a symbol
          of the heavenly family, as that in the work of the ministry he should make use of his <nobr>God-given</nobr>
          powers to win souls for the church. As the priest in the home, and as the ambassador of Christ in the church,
          he should exemplify in his life the character of Christ. He must be faithful in watching for souls as one that
          must give an account.</p>
      <p>In His service there must be seen no carelessness and inattentive work. God will not serve with the sins of men
          who have not a clear sense of the sacred responsibility involved in accepting a position as pastor of a
          church. He who fails to be a faithful, discerning shepherd in the home will surely fail of being a faithful
          shepherd to the ﬂock of God in the <nobr>church.—Manuscript</nobr> 42, 1903.</p>
      <p>Every family is a church, over which the parents preside. The ﬁrst consideration of the parents should be to
          work for the salvation of their children. When the father and mother as priest and teacher of the family take
          their position fully on the side of Christ, a good inﬂuence will be exerted in the home. And this sanctiﬁed
          inﬂuence will be felt in the church and will be recognized by every believer. Because of the great lack of
          piety and sanctiﬁcation in the home, the work of God is greatly hindered. No man can bring into the church an
          inﬂuence that he does not exert in his home life and in his business relations....</p>
      <p>The angels of God, who minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation, will help you to make your family a
          model of the heavenly family. Let there be peace in the home, and there will be peace in the church. This
          precious experience brought into the church will be the means of creating a kindly affection one for another.
          Quarrels will cease. True Christian courtesy will be seen among church members. The world will take knowledge
          of them that they have been with Jesus and have learned of Him. What an impression the church would make upon
          the world if all the members would live Christian <nobr>lives!—Child</nobr> Guidance, 549.</p>
