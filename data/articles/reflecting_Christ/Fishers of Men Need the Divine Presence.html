    <h1>Fishers of Men Need the Divine Presence</h1>

      <p><strong>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for
          a draught.... And when they had this done, they inclosed a great</strong></p>
      <p>multitude of ﬁshes: and their net brake. Luke <nobr>5:4-6.</nobr></p>
      <p>Everyone who in living faith follows Jesus, with an eye single to His glory, will see the salvation of God just
          as surely as these discouraged, despondent ﬁshermen saw their boats ﬁlled by the miraculous draught. It was
          because Christ was in the ship that they were successful in their efforts to catch ﬁsh. The indwelling
          presence of the Saviour is equally necessary in the work of winning souls.</p>
      <p>In order to save humanity, Christ, the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, laid aside His kingly crown and
          royal robe, clothed His divinity with humanity, and came to this earth as our Redeemer. For
          <nobr>thirty-three</nobr> years He lived the life of a man among men, meeting the temptations that we must
          meet, and overcoming through the strength imparted from above. His divinity was not manifested in any display
          of pomp and royal power. He could have surrounded Himself with legions of heavenly angels, thereby inducing
          everyone to believe on Him; but this would not have been in accordance with God’s purpose.</p>
      <p>Christ came to stand at the head of humanity, and to demonstrate that through the power of the Holy Spirit it
          is possible for man to withstand Satan’s temptations. With his long human arm the Saviour encircled humanity,
          while with His divine arm He grasped the throne of the Inﬁnite....</p>
      <p>We may endeavor to meet the enemy’s temptations in our own strength, doing the best we can to overcome; but we
          shall meet with disappointment after disappointment. This was the condition in which Christ found the
          disciples, after their night of unrewarded toil. They were annoyed and perplexed. Directing them to “launch
          out into the deep,” Christ said, “Let down your nets for a draught.”</p>
      <p>Long had the ﬁshermen toiled that night; often had they been disappointed in their expectations, as time and
          again the net was drawn up empty. When the Divine Presence was with them, and they, at His bidding, once more
          cast their net into the sea, what an abundance they gathered in! They were unprepared to handle so large a
          draught.... The</p>
      <p>sight of the miraculous draught of ﬁsh swept away the unbelief of the Galilean ﬁshermen, and they were ready to
          respond to Christ’s invitation to follow Him, and to learn to be ﬁshers of men.... However long and faithfully
          we may toil in our human strength, we can hope for</p>
      <p>no real results; but as soon as we welcome Christ into the heart, He will work with and through us, to the
          salvation of <nobr>souls.—Manuscript</nobr> 67, 1903.</p>
