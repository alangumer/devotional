    <h1>Joseph Resolves to be True to God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Joseph said unto [his brethren], Fear not: ... As for you, ye thought evil against me: but God
          meant it unto good ... to save much people alive. Genesis 50:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>Joseph with his captors was on the way to Egypt.... The boy could discern in the distance</p>
      <p>the hills among which lay his father’s tents. Bitterly he wept at the thought of that loving father in his
          loneliness and afﬂiction. Again the scene at Dothan came up before him. He saw his angry brothers and felt
          their ﬁerce glances bent upon him. The stinging, insulting words that had met his agonized entreaties were
          ringing in his ears. With a trembling heart he looked forward to the future. What a change in
          <nobr>situation—from</nobr> the tenderly cherished son to the despised and helpless slave! Alone and
          friendless, what would be his lot in the strange land to which he was going? For a time, Joseph gave himself
          up to uncontrolled grief and terror.</p>
      <p>But, in the providence of God, even this experience was to be a blessing to him. He had learned in a few hours
          that which years might not otherwise have taught him. His father, strong and tender as his love had been, had
          done him wrong by his partiality and indulgence. This unwise preference had angered his brothers and provoked
          them to the cruel deed that had separated him from his home. Its effects were manifest also in his own
          character. Faults had been encouraged that were now to be corrected. He was becoming
          <nobr>self-sufﬁcient</nobr> and exacting. Accustomed to the tenderness of his father’s care, he felt that he
          was unprepared to cope with the difﬁculties before him....</p>
      <p>Then his thoughts turned to his father’s God. In his childhood he had been taught to love and fear Him. Often
          in his father’s tent he had listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he ﬂed from his home an
          exile and a fugitive. He had been told of the Lord’s promises to Jacob, and how they had been
          <nobr>fulﬁlled—how,</nobr> in the hour of need, the angels of God had come to instruct, comfort, and protect
          him. And he had learned of the love of God in providing for men a Redeemer. Now all these precious lessons
          came vividly before him. Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would be his God. He then and there gave
          himself fully to the Lord, and he prayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in the land of his
          exile.</p>
      <p>His soul thrilled with the high resolve to prove himself true to <nobr>God—under</nobr> all circumstances to
          act as became a subject of the King of heaven. He would serve the Lord with undivided heart.... One day’s
          experience had been the turning point in Joseph’s life. Its</p>
      <p>terrible calamity had transformed him from a petted child to a man, thoughtful, courageous, and
          <nobr>self-possessed.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 213, 214.</p>
