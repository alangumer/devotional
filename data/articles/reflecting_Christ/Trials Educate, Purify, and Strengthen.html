    <h1>Trials Educate, Purify, and Strengthen</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the ﬁery trial which is to try you.... But</strong></p>
      <p>rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
          glad also with exceeding joy. 1 Peter 4:12, 13.</p>
      <p>Looking forward with prophetic vision to the perilous times into which the church of Christ was to enter, the
          apostle [Peter] exhorted the believers to steadfastness in the face of trial and suffering. “Beloved,” he
          wrote, “think it not strange concerning the ﬁery trial which is to try you.”</p>
      <p>Trial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to purify God’s children from the dross of
          earthliness. It is because God is leading His children that trying experiences come to them. Trials and
          obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and His appointed conditions of success.</p>
      <p>He who reads the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better than they themselves can know them. He sees that
          some have qualiﬁcations which, if rightly directed, could be used in the advancement of His work. In His
          providence He brings these souls into different positions and varied circumstances, that they may discover the
          defects that are concealed from their own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to overcome these defects and
          to ﬁt themselves for service. Often He permits the ﬁres of afﬂiction to burn, that they may be puriﬁed.</p>
      <p>God’s care for His heritage is unceasing. He suffers not afﬂiction to come upon His children but such as is
          essential for their present and eternal good. He will purify His church, even as Christ puriﬁed the temple
          during His ministry on earth. All that He brings upon His people in test and trial comes that they may gain
          deeper piety and greater strength to carry forward the triumphs of the cross.</p>
      <p>There had been a time in Peter’s experience when he was unwilling to see the cross in the work of Christ. When
          the Saviour made known to the disciples His impending sufferings and death, Peter exclaimed, “Be it far from
          thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee” (Matthew 16:22). <nobr>Self-pity,</nobr> which shrank from fellowship
          with Christ in suffering prompted Peter’s remonstrance. It was to the disciple a bitter lesson, and one which
          he learned but slowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay through agony and humiliation. But in the heat of
          the furnace ﬁre he was to learn its lesson. Now, when his <nobr>once-active</nobr> form was bowed with the
          burden of years and labors, he could write, “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the ﬁery trial which is
          to try you.... But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s</p>
      <p><nobr>sufferings.”—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 524, 525.</p>
