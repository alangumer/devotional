    <h1>Abraham’s Example as a Father</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way
          of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of
          him. Genesis 18:19.</strong></p>
      <p>Of Abraham it is written that “he was called the Friend of God” (James 2:23), “the father of all them that
          believe” (Romans 4:11). The testimony of God concerning this faithful patriarch is “Abraham obeyed my voice,
          and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws” (Genesis 26:5).... It was a high honor to which
          Abraham was</p>
      <p>called, that of being the father of the people who for centuries were the guardians and preservers of the truth
          of God for the <nobr>world—of</nobr> that people through whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed
          in the advent of the promised Messiah.</p>
      <p>But He who called the patriarch judged him worthy. It is God that speaks. He who understands the thoughts afar
          off, and places the right estimate upon men, says, “I know him.” There would be on the part of Abraham no
          betraying of the truth for selﬁsh purposes. He would keep the law and deal justly and righteously. And he
          would not only fear the Lord himself, but would cultivate religion in his home. He would instruct his family
          in righteousness. The law of God would be the rule in his household.</p>
      <p>Abraham’s household comprised more than a thousand souls. Those who were led by his teachings to worship the
          one God found a home in his encampment; and here, as in a school, they received such instruction as would
          prepare them to be representatives of the true faith. Thus a great responsibility rested upon him. He was
          training heads of families, and his methods of government would be carried out in the households over which
          they should preside....</p>
      <p>Abraham sought, by every means in his power, to guard the inmates of his encampment against mingling with the
          heathen and witnessing their idolatrous practices, for he knew that familiarity with evil would insensibly
          corrupt the principles. The greatest care was exercised to shut out every form of false religion and to
          impress the mind with the majesty and glory of the living God as the true object of worship....</p>
      <p>Abraham’s affection for his children and his household led him to guard their religious faith, to impart to
          them a knowledge of the divine statutes, as the most precious legacy he could transmit to them, and through
          them to the world. All were taught that they were under the rule of the God of heaven. There was to be no
          oppression on the part of parents, and no disobedience on the part of children. God’s law had appointed to
          each his duties, and only in obedience to it could any secure happiness or <nobr>prosperity.—Patriarchs</nobr>
          and Prophets, <nobr>140-142.</nobr></p>
