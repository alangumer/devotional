    <h1>Self Is Hidden And Christ Is Revealed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am cruciﬁed with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which
          I now live in the ﬂesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Galatians
          2:20.</strong></p>
      <p>As a Christian submits to the solemn rite of baptism, the three highest powers in the <nobr>universe—the</nobr>
          Father, the Son, and the Holy <nobr>Spirit—place</nobr> Their approval on his act, pledging Themselves to
          exert Their power in his behalf as he strives to honor God. He is buried in the likeness of Christ’s death,
          and is raised in the likeness of His resurrection....</p>
      <p>The three great powers of heaven pledge Themselves to furnish the Christian with all the assistance he
          requires. The Spirit changes the heart of stone to the heart of ﬂesh. And by partaking of the Word of God,
          Christians obtain an experience that is after the divine similitude. When Christ abides in the heart by faith,
          the Christian is the temple of God. Christ does not abide in the heart of the sinner, but in the heart of him
          who is susceptible to the inﬂuences of heaven.</p>
      <p>The light that shines forth from the life of the true Christian testiﬁes to his union with Christ. Self is
          hidden from view, and Christ is revealed....“Now are we the sons of God, and</p>
      <p>it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we
          shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2). Then those whose lives have been hidden with Christ, those who on this
          earth have fought the good ﬁght of faith, will shine forth with the Redeemer’s glory in the kingdom of
          God.</p>
      <p>My brother, my sister, God’s purpose for you is that you shall live a life that will make others
          <nobr>better—a</nobr> life which will show that Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. It is His purpose
          that you shall be able to say with the apostle Paul, “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me” (Galatians
          2:20). In perfect content, resting in the love of Christ, trusting the Redeemer and <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> to
          work out for you the salvation of your soul, you will know, as you draw nearer and still nearer to Him, what
          it means to endure the seeing of Him who is invisible.... The contentment that Christ bestows is a gift worth
          inﬁnitely more than gold</p>
      <p>and silver and precious stones....</p>
      <p>Our lives are pure only when we are under the control of God, and happy only when we hold communion with Him.
          The luster possessed by those who have gained the richest experience is but the reﬂection of the light of the
          Sun of Righteousness. He who lives nearest to Jesus shines the <nobr>brightest.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times,
          August 16, 1905.</p>
