    <h1>Parents to Teach Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Ephesians 6:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The children are to be taught that their capabilities were given them for the honor and glory of God. To this
          end they must learn the lesson of obedience; for only by lives of willing obedience can they render to God the
          service He requires. Before the child is old enough to reason, he must be taught to obey. By gentle,
          persistent effort, the habit should be established....</p>
      <p>Let children be shown that true reverence is revealed by obedience. God has commanded nothing that is
          unessential, and there is no other way of manifesting reverence so pleasing to Him as by obedience to that
          which He has spoken.</p>
      <p>The mother is the queen of the home, and the children are her subjects. She is to rule her household wisely, in
          the dignity of her motherhood.... Tell your children exactly what you</p>
      <p>require of them. Then let them understand that your word must be obeyed. Thus you are training them to respect
          the commandments of God, which plainly declare, “Thou shalt,” and “Thou shalt not.”</p>
      <p>Few parents begin early enough to teach their children to obey. The child is usually allowed to get two or
          three years the start of its parents, who forbear to discipline it, thinking it too young to learn to obey.
          But all this time self is growing strong in the little being, and every day makes harder the parent’s task of
          gaining control. At a very early age children can comprehend what is plainly and simply told them, and by kind
          and judicious management can be taught to obey. Never should they be allowed to show their parents disrespect.
          <nobr>Self-will</nobr> should never be permitted to go unrebuked. The future <nobr>well-being</nobr> of the
          child requires kindly, loving, but ﬁrm discipline....</p>
      <p>Wise parents will not say to their children, “Follow your own choice; go where you will, and do what you will”;
          but, “Listen to the instruction of the Lord.” Wise rules and regulations must be made and enforced, that the
          beauty of the homelife may not be spoiled....</p>
      <p>Children will be happier, far happier, under proper discipline than if left to do as their unrestrained
          impulses suggest. A child’s truest graces consist in modesty and <nobr>obedience—in</nobr> attentive ears to
          hear the words of direction, in willing feet and hands to walk and work in the path of duty....</p>
      <p>Above all things, parents should surround their children with an atmosphere of cheerfulness, courtesy, and
          love. A home where love dwells and where it ﬁnds expression in looks, in words, in acts, is a place where
          angels delight to <nobr>dwell.—Counsels</nobr> to Parents and Teachers, pp. <nobr>111-115.</nobr></p>
