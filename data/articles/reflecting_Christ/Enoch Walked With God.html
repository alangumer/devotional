    <h1>Enoch Walked With God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; ... for before his translation he had this
          testimony, that he pleased God. Hebrews 11:5.</strong></p>
      <p>The knowledge of God that works transformation of character is our great need. If we fulﬁll His purpose, there
          must be in our lives a revelation of God that shall correspond to the teaching of His Word.</p>
      <p>The experience of Enoch and of John the Baptist represents what ours should be. Far more than we do, we need to
          study the lives of these <nobr>men—he</nobr> who was translated to heaven without seeing death, and he who,
          before Christ’s ﬁrst advent, was called to prepare the way of the Lord, to make His paths straight.</p>
      <p>Of Enoch it is written that he lived <nobr>sixty-ﬁve</nobr> years and begat a son; after that he walked with
          God three hundred years. During those earlier years, Enoch had loved and feared God, and had kept His
          commandments. But after the birth of his ﬁrst son he reached a higher experience; he was drawn into closer
          relationship with God. As he saw the child’s love for its father, its simple trust in his protection; as he
          felt the deep, yearning tenderness of his own heart for that ﬁrstborn son, he learned a precious lesson of the
          wonderful love of God to man in the gift of His Son, and the conﬁdence which the children of God may repose in
          their heavenly Father. The inﬁnite, unfathomable love of God through Christ became the subject of his
          meditations day and night. With all the fervor of his soul he sought to reveal that love to the people among
          whom he dwelt....</p>
      <p>His faith waxed stronger, his love became more ardent, with the lapse of centuries. To him prayer was as the
          breath of the soul. He lived in the atmosphere of heaven....</p>
      <p>The power of God that wrought with His servant was felt by those who heard. Some gave heed to the warning and
          renounced their sins; but the multitudes mocked at the solemn message....</p>
      <p>For three hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity of heart, that he might be in harmony with heaven. For
          three centuries he had walked with God. Day by day he had longed for a closer union; nearer and nearer had
          grown the communion, until God took him to Himself. He had stood at the threshold of the eternal world, only a
          step between him and the land of the blest; and now the portals opened, the walk with God, so long pursued on
          earth, continued, and he passed through the gates of the Holy City, the ﬁrst from among men to enter
          there....</p>
      <p>To such communion God is calling us. As was Enoch’s must be their holiness of character who shall be redeemed
          from among men at the Lord’s second <nobr>coming.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church
          <nobr>8:329-331.</nobr></p>
