      <p><strong>Chap. 304 - Contemplating Heavenly Things</strong></p>
      <p>God ... hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Ephesians
          <nobr>2:4-6.</nobr></p>
      <p>If we would bear in mind the momentous events which are soon to take place, we would not be so weak in
          character. We would feel that we were living in the presence of God, and awed and amazed we should heed the
          injunction, “Be still, and know that I am God.” Oh, when shall we ever realize the full value of our Saviour’s
          work and intercession? When shall we rely upon Him with full conﬁdence, and live a noble, pure, and devoted
          life? To what heights may the imagination reach when sanctiﬁed and inspired by the virtue of Christ! We may
          take in the glories of the future, eternal world. We may live as seeing Him who is invisible. Walk by faith
          and not by sight....</p>
      <p>Through searching the Scriptures we may come to understand what we are to Christ, and what He is to us. By
          beholding Him we are to become changed into His image, becoming colaborers with Him, representatives of Him in
          life and character. We must learn to realize that we are to live as the sons and daughters of God, loving God
          supremely, and our neighbors as ourselves. We are to live a pure, perfect life for Christ’s sake. We are to
          love perfection because Jesus is the embodiment of perfection, the great center of attraction. The life we now
          live we must live by faith in the Son of God.</p>
      <p>If we follow Christ we shall not have a spasmodical experience, and be moved by circumstances and inﬂuenced by
          our surroundings. We shall not let feeling control us, and indulge in fretting, envying, faultﬁnding,
          jealousy, and vanity.</p>
      <p>It is indulgence in these things that puts us out of harmony with the harmonious life of Christ, and prevents
          us from becoming overcomers. We should be actuated by the noble purpose of winning daily victories, and by
          watchfulness and sincere prayer attain to complete control of self. When petty trials come upon us, and words
          are spoken that cut and bruise the soul, speak to yourself and say, “I am a child of God, heir with Jesus
          Christ, a colaborer with heaven, and I cannot afford to easily take offense, to be always thinking of self;
          for this will produce a distorted character, and is unworthy of my high calling. My heavenly Father has given
          me a work to do, and let me do it worthily for His name’s sake.”</p>
      <p>We should consider earnestly and continually the excellence of the character of Jesus Christ, that we may
          impart His blessings and lead men to follow in His <nobr>footsteps.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, July 10,
          1893.</p>
