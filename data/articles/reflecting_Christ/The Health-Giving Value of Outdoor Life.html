    <h1>The Health-Giving Value of Outdoor Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul
          prospereth. 3 John 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The things of nature are God’s blessings, provided to give health to body, mind, and soul. They are given to
          the well to keep them well and to the sick to make them well. Connected with water treatment, they are more
          effective in restoring health than all the drug medication in the world.</p>
      <p>In the country the sick ﬁnd many things to call their attention away from themselves and their sufferings.
          Everywhere they can look upon and enjoy the beautiful things of <nobr>nature—the</nobr> ﬂowers, the ﬁelds, the
          fruit trees laden with their rich treasure, the forest trees casting their grateful shade, and the hills and
          valleys with their varied verdure and many forms of life.</p>
      <p>And not only are they entertained by these surroundings, but at the same time they learn most precious
          spiritual lessons. Surrounded by the wonderful works of God, their minds are lifted from the things that are
          seen to the things that are unseen. The beauty of nature leads them to think of the matchless charms of the
          earth made new, where there will be nothing to mar the loveliness, nothing to taint or destroy, nothing to
          cause disease or death.</p>
      <p>Nature is God’s physician. The pure air, the glad sunshine, the beautiful ﬂowers and trees, the orchards and
          vineyards, and outdoor exercise amid these surroundings, are <nobr>health-giving—the</nobr> elixir of life.
          Outdoor life is the only medicine that many invalids need. Its inﬂuence is powerful to heal sickness caused by
          fashionable life, a life that weakens and destroys the physical, mental, and spiritual powers.</p>
      <p>How grateful to weary invalids accustomed to city life, the glare of many lights, and the noise of the streets
          are the quiet and freedom of the country! How eagerly do they turn to the scenes of nature! How glad would
          they be for the advantages of a sanitarium in the country, where they could sit in the open air, rejoice in
          the sunshine, and breathe the fragrance of tree and ﬂower! There are <nobr>life-giving</nobr> properties in
          the balsam of the pine, in the fragrance of the cedar and the ﬁr. And there are other trees that are
          <nobr>health-promoting.</nobr> Let no such trees be ruthlessly cut down. Cherish them where they are abundant,
          and plant more where there are but few....</p>
      <p>Nothing so tends to restore health and happiness as living amid attractive country surroundings.... May God
          help us to do our utmost to utilize the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of</p>
      <p>sunshine and fresh <nobr>air.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church <nobr>7:76-79.</nobr></p>
