      <p><strong>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God
          hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 2
          Corinthians 6:16.</strong></p>
      <p>We are abiding in Christ by a living faith. He is abiding in our hearts by our individual appropriating of
          faith. We have the companionship of the divine presence, and as we realize this presence our thoughts are
          brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. Our spiritual exercises are in accordance with the vividness of our
          sense of this companionship. Enoch walked with God in this way; and Christ is dwelling in our hearts by faith
          when we will consider what He is to us, and what a work He has wrought out for us in the plan of redemption.
          We shall be most happy in cultivating a sense of this great gift of God to our world and to us
          personally.</p>
      <p>These thoughts have a controlling power upon the whole character. I want to impress upon your mind that you may
          have a divine companion with you, if you will, always....</p>
      <p>As the mind dwells upon Christ, the character is molded after the divine similitude. The thoughts are pervaded
          with a sense of His goodness, His love. We contemplate His character, and thus He is in all our thoughts. His
          love encloses us. If we gaze even a moment upon the sun in its meridian glory, when we turn away our eyes the
          image of the sun will appear in everything upon which we look.</p>
      <p>Thus it is when we behold Jesus; everything we look upon reﬂects His image, the Sun of Righteousness. We cannot
          see anything else, or talk of anything else. His image is imprinted upon the eye of the soul, and affects
          every portion of our daily life, softening and subduing our whole nature. By beholding, we are conformed to
          the divine similitude, even the likeness of Christ. To all with whom we associate we reﬂect the bright and
          cheerful beams of His righteousness. We have become transformed in character; for heart, soul, mind, are
          irradiated by the reﬂection of Him who loved us and gave Himself for us. Here again there is the realization
          of a personal, living inﬂuence dwelling in our hearts by faith.</p>
      <p>When His words of instruction have been received, and have taken possession of us, Jesus is to us an abiding
          presence, controlling our thoughts and ideas and actions....</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ is everything to <nobr>us—the</nobr> ﬁrst, the last, the best in everything. Jesus Christ, His
          Spirit, His character, colors everything; it is the warp and woof, the very texture of our entire being....
          Continuing to look unto Jesus, we reﬂect His image to all around</p>
