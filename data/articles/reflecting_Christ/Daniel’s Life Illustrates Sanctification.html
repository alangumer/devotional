    <h1>Daniel’s Life Illustrates Sanctiﬁcation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
          Azariah, “Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.”
          Daniel 1:11, 12, N.K.J.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Daniel might have found a plausible excuse to depart from his strictly temperate habits; but the approval of
          God was dearer to him than the favor of the most powerful earthly <nobr>potentate—dearer</nobr> even than life
          itself....</p>
      <p>Daniel requested that the matter be decided by a ten days’ <nobr>trial—the</nobr> Hebrew youth during this
          brief period being permitted to eat of simple food, while their companions partook of the king’s dainties....
          The Lord regarded with approval the ﬁrmness and</p>
      <p><nobr>self-denial</nobr> of the Hebrew youth, and His blessing attended them....</p>
      <p>The life of Daniel is an inspired illustration of what constitutes a sanctiﬁed character. It presents a lesson
          for all, and especially for the young. A strict compliance with the requirements of God is beneﬁcial to the
          health of body and mind. In order to reach the highest standard of moral and intellectual attainments, it is
          necessary to seek wisdom and strength from God and to observe strict temperance in all the habits of
          life.</p>
      <p>In the experience of Daniel and his companions we have an instance of the triumph of principle over temptation
          to indulge the appetite. It shows us that through religious principle young men may triumph over the lusts of
          the ﬂesh and remain true to God’s requirements, even though it cost them a great sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>What if Daniel and his companions had made a compromise with those heathen ofﬁcers and had yielded to the
          pressure of the occasion by eating and drinking as was customary with the Babylonians? That single instance of
          departure from principle would have weakened their sense of right and their abhorrence of wrong. Indulgence of
          appetite would have involved the sacriﬁce of physical vigor, clearness of intellect, and spiritual power. One
          wrong step would probably have led to others, until, their connection with Heaven being severed, they would
          have been swept away by temptation.</p>
      <p>God has said, “Them that honour me I will honour” (1 Samuel 2:30). While Daniel clung to his God with
          unwavering trust, the Spirit of prophetic power came upon him. While he was instructed of man in the duties of
          court life, he was taught of God to read the mysteries of future ages and to present to coming generations,
          through ﬁgures and similitudes, the wonderful things that would come to pass in the last
          <nobr>days.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>21-24.</nobr></p>
