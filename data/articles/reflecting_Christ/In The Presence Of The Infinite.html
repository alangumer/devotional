    <h1>In The Presence Of The Inﬁnite</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the ﬁre, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
          fourth is like the Son of God. Daniel 3:25.</strong></p>
      <p>The ﬁery furnace had been heated seven times more than it was wont, and into it were cast the Hebrew exiles. So
          furious were the ﬂames, that the men who cast them in were burned to death.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the countenance of the king paled with terror. His eyes were ﬁxed upon the glowing ﬂames, and turning
          to his lords, he said, “Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the ﬁre?” (Daniel 3:4). The answer
          was, “True, O king.” And now the monarch exclaimed, “Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the
          ﬁre, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God” (verse 25).</p>
      <p>When Christ manifests Himself to the children of men, an unseen power speaks to their souls. They feel
          themselves to be in the presence of the Inﬁnite One. Before His majesty, kings and nobles tremble, and
          acknowledge that the living God is above every earthly power.</p>
      <p>With feelings of remorse and shame, the king exclaimed, “Ye servants of the most high God, come forth” (verse
          26). And they obeyed, showing themselves unhurt before that vast multitude, not even the smell of the ﬁre
          being upon their garments. This miracle produced a striking change in the minds of the people. The great
          golden image, set up with such display, was forgotten. The king published a decree that anyone speaking
          against the God of these men should be put to death, “because there is no other God that can deliver after
          this sort” (verse 29).</p>
      <p>These three Hebrews possessed genuine sanctiﬁcation. True Christian principle will not stop to weigh the
          consequences. It does not ask, What will people think of me if I do this? or, How will it affect my worldly
          prospects if I do that? With the most intense longing the children of God desire to know what He would have
          them do, that their works may glorify Him. The Lord has made ample provision that the hearts and lives of all
          His followers may be controlled by divine grace, that they may be as burning and shining lights in the
          world.</p>
      <p>These faithful Hebrews possessed great natural ability, they had enjoyed the highest intellectual culture, and
          now occupied a position of honor; but all this did not lead them to forget God. Their powers were yielded to
          the sanctifying inﬂuence of divine grace. By their steadfast integrity they showed forth the praises of Him
          who had called them out of darkness into His marvelous <nobr>light.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life,
          <nobr>38-40.</nobr></p>
