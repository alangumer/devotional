    <h1>Relieving the World’s Misery</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven ...: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be
          also. Matthew 6:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>Where their treasure is, there will their heart be also. Those who have the Lord’s talents of means are placed
          under a heavy responsibility. They are not to invest money merely for the gratiﬁcation of selﬁsh desires, for
          whatever is spent in this way is just that much kept from the Lord’s treasury. Through the sovereign goodness
          of God, the Holy Spirit works through the human agent, and causes him to make smaller or larger investments in
          the cause of God, to make them redound to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>Whenever you think of using the Lord’s money for your own selﬁsh gratiﬁcation, remember that there are many who
          are in deep poverty who cannot purchase either food or clothing, and they are God’s heritage. We are to do
          good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. If those who have abundant means
          are God’s agents in dealing in truth, they will use their treasures wisely, so that none of the household of
          faith need to go hungry or naked.</p>
      <p>The reason there is such accumulated misery in our world is because those who have been entrusted with money
          expend it to gratify unsanctiﬁed desires, in purchasing needless ornaments of gold and precious stones, and in
          procuring fancy articles for adornment’s sake. But at the same time those who have been purchased by the blood
          of Christ are starving for food, and their cry entereth into the ears of the God of Sabaoth....In every place
          where the</p>
      <p>truth is to go, those who are to be colaborers with God have a work to do....</p>
      <p>Earnest work must be done, not only by a few ministers, but by the whole membership of the church. The Lord God
          of heaven calls upon men to put away their idols, to cut off every extravagant desire, to indulge in nothing
          that is simply for display and parade, and to study economy in purchasing garments and furniture. Do not
          expend one dollar of God’s money in purchasing needless articles. Your money means the salvation of souls.
          Then let it not be spent for gems, for gold, or precious stones.</p>
      <p>Souls for whom Christ died are perishing in their sins, and we are continually bound about because of want of
          means wherewith to advance the cause of God. Would you not rather have gems in the crown which Jesus shall
          place upon your head than expend your money for precious stones to please the fancy here in this world?...
          Every pound is needed, every shilling can be put to use, and invested in such a way as to bring you
          imperishable <nobr>treasure.—Letter</nobr> 90, 1895.</p>
