    <h1>Invite the Youth to your Homes</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
          Matthew 25:40.</strong></p>
      <p>We are in a world of sin and temptation, and youth are perishing out of Christ all around us, and He wants you
          to labor for the youth in every conceivable way that you can. If you have a house, and a pleasant home, then
          invite the youth that have no homes, invite the youth that are in need of help, that are in need of sympathy
          and kind words, courtesy, and respect. They want all this. If you want to bring them to Christ, you must show
          your love and respect for the purchase of His blood, the souls whom He has ransomed by the inﬁnite cost of His
          own precious life, and is not that enough to lead us, as soon as we are a branch in the vine, to bear fruit?
          ...</p>
      <p>In heaven we shall see those youth that we helped, those youth that we invited to our house, those youth that
          we led from temptation, those youth that we tried to win away from being drunkards and tobacco users and wine
          drinkers and all these habits which are taking the underpinning out of the house, befogging the brain, and
          taking away the reason, and leaving men without a sound mind, and a sound body.... What do we want? A face
          that</p>
      <p>will reﬂect the sunshine of the glory of God, we want a face that reﬂects the likeness of the divine. We want a
          character reshaped. We want that the image of Christ should be restored to us. May God help us that we may ...
          do our best in our lifetime.</p>
      <p>You have no time to devote to the theater or the dance hall. You have no time to grumble. It is lost, lost. You
          have no time to play cards. You have no time to attend horse races. You have no time to attend shows. How is
          it with my soul? ... Have I a living connection with God? If I have, I must seek to win these souls that are
          attracted with these outward pleasures. Satan has managed it. Satan has devised it that one pleasure should
          crowd on the heels of another, a feverish excitement. No time to contemplate God, no time to think of heaven
          or heavenly things, no time to study the Bible, no time to put forth interested efforts for those that are out
          of Christ.</p>
      <p>But those that ... are giving themselves to Jesus ... can hear that voice that shall pronounce the benediction,
          “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” There,
          you see, that is election.... It was</p>
      <p>prepared for every soul that would be obedient to God and that would work in Christ’s lines, because that when
          they obtain the treasure of heavenly reward, they enter into the joy of their Lord, because their joy was full
          of Christ’s joy which was to win souls to the <nobr>Saviour.—Manuscript</nobr> 43, 1894.</p>
