    <h1>Love, the Ruling Principle of Action</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let us not love in word ...; but in deed and in truth. 1 John 3:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Divine love makes its most touching appeals to the heart when it calls upon us to manifest the same tender
          compassion that Christ manifested. That man only who has unselﬁsh love for his brother has true love for God.
          The true Christian will not willingly permit the soul in peril and need to go unwarned, uncared for. He will
          not hold himself aloof from the erring, leaving them to plunge farther into unhappiness and discouragement or
          to fall on Satan’s battleground.</p>
      <p>Those who have never experienced the tender, winning love of Christ cannot lead others to the fountain of life.
          His love in the heart is a constraining power, which leads men to reveal Him in the conversation, in the
          tender, pitiful spirit, in the uplifting of the lives of those with whom they associate. Christian workers who
          succeed in their efforts must know Christ; and in order to know Him, they must know His love. In heaven their
          ﬁtness as workers is measured by their ability to love as Christ loved and to work as He worked.</p>
      <p>“Let us not love in word,” the apostle writes, “but in deed and in truth.” The completeness of Christian
          character is attained when the impulse to help and bless others springs constantly from within. It is the
          atmosphere of this love surrounding the soul of the believer that makes him a savor of life unto life, and
          enables God to bless his work.</p>
      <p>Supreme love for God and unselﬁsh love for one <nobr>another—this</nobr> is the best gift that our heavenly
          Father can bestow. This love is not an impulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated
          heart cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found. “We love him, because
          he ﬁrst loved us.” In the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the ruling principle of action. It modiﬁes
          the character, governs the impulses, controls the passions, and ennobles the affections. This love, cherished
          in the soul, sweetens the life and sheds a reﬁning inﬂuence on all around.</p>
      <p>John strove to lead the believers to understand the exalted privileges that would come to them through the
          exercise of the spirit of love. This redeeming power, ﬁlling the heart, would control every other motive and
          raise its possessors above the corrupting inﬂuences of the world. And as this love was allowed full sway and
          became the motive power in the life, their trust and conﬁdence in God and His dealing with them would be
          <nobr>complete.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>550-552.</nobr></p>
