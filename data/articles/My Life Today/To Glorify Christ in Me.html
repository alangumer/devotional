    <h1>To Glorify Christ in Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Work of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. John 16:14</p>
      <p>In these words Christ declares the crowning work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit gloriﬁes Christ by making Him
          the object of supreme regard, and the Saviour becomes the delight, the rejoicing, of the human agent in whose
          heart is wrought this transformation....</p>
      <p>Repentance toward God and faith in Jesus Christ are the fruits of the renewing power of the grace of the
          Spirit. Repentance represents the process by which the soul seeks to reﬂect the image of Christ to the
          world.</p>
      <p>Christ gives them the breath of His own Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its
          highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multiplies their faculties, and
          every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls. Through
          cooperation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds
          of Omnipotence.</p>
      <p>It should be the work of the Christian’s life to put on Christ and to bring himself to a more perfect likeness
          of Christ. The sons and daughters of God are to advance in their resemblance to Christ, our pattern. Daily
          they are to behold His glory and contemplate His incomparable excellence.</p>
      <p>O that the baptism of the Holy Spirit might come upon you, that you might be imbued with the Spirit of God!
          Then day by day you will become more and more conformed to the image of Christ, and in every action of your
          life the question would be, “Will it glorify my Master?” By patient continuance in <nobr>well-doing</nobr> you
          would seek for glory and honor, and would receive the gift of immortality.</p>
