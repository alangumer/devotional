    <h1>Say Nothing That Will Wound or Grieve</h1>

      <p><strong>Emotional Maturity Brings Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they
          speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. 1 Peter 3:10, 11</p>
      <p>If the lips were constantly guarded so that no guile could corrupt them, what an amount of suffering,
          degradation, and misery might be prevented. If we would say nothing to wound or grieve, except in necessary
          reproof of sin, that God might not be dishonored, how much misunderstanding, bitterness, and anguish would be
          prevented. If we would speak words of good cheer, words of hope and faith in God, how much light we might shed
          upon the pathway of others, to be reﬂected in still brighter beams upon our own souls.... The plan of
          salvation, as revealed</p>
      <p>in the Holy Scriptures, opens up a way whereby man may secure happiness and prolong his days upon the earth, as
          well as enjoy the favor of Heaven and secure that future life which measures with the life of God.</p>
      <p>Many persons complain of Providence because of the discomfort and inconvenience which they suffer, when this is
          the sure result of their own course. They seem to feel that they are <nobr>ill-treated</nobr> of God, when
          they themselves are alone responsible for the ills which they endure. Our kind and merciful heavenly Father
          has established laws, which, obeyed, would promote physical, mental, and moral health....</p>
      <p>God requires us to yield our own will to His; but He does not ask us to give up anything that it would be for
          our good to retain. No one can be happy while he devotes his life to selﬁsh gratiﬁcation. A course of
          obedience to God is the wisest course for us to pursue; for it brings peace, content, and happiness as a sure
          result....</p>
      <p>If men would place themselves in right relation to God by heeding the counsel of His Word, they would escape
          innumerable dangers and experience a peace and content that would render life a joy rather than a burden.</p>
