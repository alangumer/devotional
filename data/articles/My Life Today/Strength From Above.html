    <h1>Strength From Above</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Partakers of the Divine Nature</strong></p>
      <p>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they
          shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. Isaiah 40:31</p>
      <p>Wonderful are the possibilities before the youth to grasp the assurances of God’s Word. Scarcely can the human
          mind comprehend the spiritual attainments which can be reached by them as they become partakers of the divine
          nature. Daily correcting mistakes and gaining victories, they grow into wise, strong men and women in
          Christ.</p>
      <p>He who has become a partaker of the divine nature knows that his citizenship is above. He catches the
          inspiration from the Spirit of Christ. His soul is hid with Christ in God. Such a man Satan can no longer
          employ as his instrumentality to insinuate himself into the very sanctuary of God, to deﬁle the temple of God.
          He gains victories at every step. He is ﬁlled with ennobling thoughts. He regards every human being as
          precious, because Christ has died for every soul.</p>
      <p>“They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles.” The man
          who waits upon the Lord is strong in his strength, strong enough to hold ﬁrm under great pressure. Yet he is
          easy to be entreated on the side of mercy and compassion, which is the side of Christ. The soul that is
          submissive to God is ready to do the will of God; he diligently and humbly seeks to know that will. He accepts
          discipline, and is afraid to walk according to his own ﬁnite judgment. He communes with God, and his
          conversation is in heaven.</p>
      <p>Linked to the Inﬁnite One, man is made partaker of the divine nature. Upon him the shafts of evil have no
          effect; for he is clothed with the panoply of Christ’s righteousness.</p>
