      <p><strong>God in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me.
          Isaiah 46:9</p>
      <p>In heaven God is all in all. There, holiness reigns supreme; there is nothing to mar the perfect harmony with
          God. If we are indeed journeying thither, the spirit of heaven will dwell in our hearts here. But if we ﬁnd no
          pleasure now in the contemplation of heavenly things; if we have no interest in seeking the knowledge of God,
          no delight in beholding the character of Christ; if holiness has no attractions for <nobr>us–then</nobr> we
          may be sure that our hope of heaven is vain. Perfect conformity to the will of God is the high aim to be
          constantly before the Christian. He will love to talk of God, of Jesus, of the home of bliss and purity which
          Christ has prepared for them that love Him. The contemplation of these themes, when the soul feasts upon the
          blessed assurances of God, the apostle represents as tasting “the powers of the world to come.”</p>
      <p>The knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowledge that all who are saved must have. It is the
          knowledge that works transformation of character. This knowledge, received, will <nobr>re-create</nobr> the
          soul in the image of God. It will impart to the whole being a spiritual power that is divine....</p>
      <p>“For this cause,” Paul says, “I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family
          in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be
          strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that
          ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
          length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be ﬁlled
          with all the fulness of God.</p>
