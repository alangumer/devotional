    <h1>Loving Thoughtfulness in the Home</h1>

      <p><strong>Roads to Happiness That Are Never Closed</strong></p>
      <p>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 1 John 4:12</p>
      <p>Make your home atmosphere fragrant with tender thoughtfulness.</p>
      <p>Home is to be the center of the purest and most elevated affection. Peace, harmony, affection, and happiness
          should be perseveringly cherished every day, until these precious things abide in the hearts of those who
          compose the family.</p>
      <p>The reason there are so many hardhearted men and women in our world is that true affection has been regarded as
          weakness and has been discouraged and repressed. The better part of the nature of persons of this class was
          perverted and dwarfed in childhood, and unless rays of divine light can melt away their coldness and
          hardhearted selﬁshness, the happiness of such is buried forever. If we would have tender hearts, such as Jesus
          had when He was upon the earth, and sanctiﬁed sympathy, such as the angels have for sinful mortals, we must
          cultivate the sympathies of childhood, which are simplicity itself.</p>
      <p>Commend your children whenever you can. Make their lives as happy as possible.... Keep the soil of the heart
          mellow by the manifestation of love and</p>
      <p>affection, thus preparing it for the seed of truth.... The Lord gives the earth</p>
      <p>not only clouds and rain but the beautiful, smiling sunshine, causing the seed to germinate and the blossoms to
          appear.</p>
      <p>An approving glance, a word of encouragement or commendation, will be like sunshine in their hearts, often
          making the whole day happy.</p>
      <p>The happiness of husband and children should be more sacred to every wife and mother than that of all
          others.</p>
