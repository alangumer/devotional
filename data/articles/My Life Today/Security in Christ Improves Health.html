      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days. Proverbs 10:27</p>
      <p>All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for communion with their own hearts, with nature, and
          with God.... We must individually hear</p>
      <p>Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence
          of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, “Be still, and know that I am God.” ... Amidst
          the hurrying throngs and the strain of life’s intense activities, he who is thus refreshed will be surrounded
          with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will receive a new endowment of both physical and mental
          strength.</p>
      <p>Let the mind become intelligent and the will be placed on the Lord’s side, and there will be a wonderful
          improvement in the physical health.</p>
      <p>Sickness of the mind prevails everywhere. Nine tenths of the diseases from which men suffer have their
          foundation here.... The religion of Christ ... is one of</p>
      <p>its most effectual remedies, for it is a potent soother of the nerves.</p>
      <p>Heaven is all health; and the more deeply heavenly inﬂuences are realized, the more sure will be the
          recovery....</p>
      <p>Godliness does not conﬂict with the laws of health, but is in harmony with them. The fear of the Lord is the
          foundation of all real prosperity.</p>
      <p>We should cooperate with God in the care of our bodies. Love for God is essential for life and health. Faith in
          God is essential for health. In order to have perfect health, our hearts must be ﬁlled with love and hope and
          joy in the Lord.</p>
