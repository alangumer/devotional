      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have
          commanded you, that it may be well unto you. Jeremiah 7:23</p>
      <p>You need and I need that the spiritual vision shall be cleared and intensiﬁed to behold the scheme of
          redemption as we have never viewed it before. We want that our hearts should feel the mighty throbs of a
          Saviour’s love. In searching the Scriptures, in feeding upon the words of life, O consider it is the voice of
          God to the soul. We may be confused sometimes over the voice of our friends; but in the Bible we have the
          counsel of God upon all important subjects which concern our eternal interests, and in temporal matters we may
          learn a great deal. Its teaching will be always suited to our peculiar circumstances and calculated to prepare
          us to endure trial and ﬁt us for our <nobr>God-given</nobr> work.</p>
      <p>The Bible is God’s voice speaking to us, just as surely as if we could hear it with our ears. If we realized
          this, with what awe we would open God’s Word and with what earnestness we would search its precepts. The
          reading and contemplation of the Scriptures would be regarded as an audience with the Inﬁnite One.</p>
      <p>We are to open the Word of God with reverence and with a sincere desire to know the will of God concerning us.
          The heavenly angels will direct our search. God speaks to us in His Word. We are in the audience chamber of
          the Most High, in the very presence of God. Christ enters the heart.</p>
      <p>Show that you reverence your faith, speaking reverently of sacred things. Never allow one expression of
          lightness and triﬂing to escape your lips when quoting Scripture. As you take the Bible in your hands,
          remember that you are on holy ground.</p>
