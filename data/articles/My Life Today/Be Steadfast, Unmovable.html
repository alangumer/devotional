      <p><strong>Victory in the Conﬂict</strong></p>
      <p>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as
          ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Corinthians 15:58</p>
      <p>Those who stand in defense of the honor of God, and maintain the purity of truth at any cost, will have
          manifold trials, as did our Saviour in the wilderness of temptation. The yielding temperaments, who have not
          courage to condemn wrong, but keep silent when their inﬂuence is needed to stand in the defense of right
          against any pressure, may avoid many heartaches and escape many perplexities, and lose a very rich reward, if
          not their own souls.</p>
      <p>Those who in harmony with God, and through faith in Him, receive strength to resist wrong, and stand in defense
          of the right, will always have severe conﬂicts and will frequently have to stand almost alone. But precious
          victories will be theirs while they make God their dependence. His grace will be their strength. Their moral
          sense will be keen, clear, and sensitive. Their moral powers will be equal to withstand wrong inﬂuences. Their
          integrity, like that of Moses, of the purest character.</p>
      <p>It will require moral courage to do God’s work unﬂinchingly. Those who do this can give no place to
          <nobr>self-love,</nobr> to selﬁsh considerations, ambition, love of ease, or desire to shun the cross....
          Shall we obey His voice, or shall we listen to the</p>
      <p>soothing voice of the evil one, and be rocked to a fatal slumber just on the eve of eternal realities?</p>
      <p>Our Saviour longs to save the young.... He is waiting to place upon their heads</p>
      <p>the crown of life and hear their happy voices join in ascribing honor and glory and majesty to God and the Lamb
          in the song of victory that shall echo and <nobr>re-echo</nobr> throughout the courts of heaven.</p>
