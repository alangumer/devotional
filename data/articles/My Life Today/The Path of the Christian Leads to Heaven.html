      <p><strong>Growing in Grace</strong></p>
      <p>The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. Proverbs
          4:18</p>
      <p>The youth may receive grace from Christ daily, and ﬁnd their light growing brighter and brighter as they follow
          in the path of holiness....</p>
      <p>Growth in grace will not lead you to be proud, <nobr>self-conﬁdent,</nobr> and boastful, but will make you more
          conscious of your own nothingness, of your entire dependence upon the Lord. He who is growing in grace will be
          ever reaching heavenward, obtaining clear views of the fullness of the provisions of the gospel.</p>
      <p>The youth may be free in Christ; they may be the children of light, and not of darkness. God calls upon every
          young man and young woman to renounce every evil habit, to be diligent in business, fervent in spirit, serving
          the Lord. Jesus will help you, so that you need not remain in indolence, making no effort to correct your
          wrongs or improve your conduct. The sincerity of your prayers will be proved by the vigor of the effort you
          make to obey all of God’s commandments. You may move intelligently, and at every step renounce evil habits and
          associations, believing that the Lord will renovate your heart by the power of His Spirit....</p>
      <p>Do not excuse your defects of character, but in the grace of Christ overcome them. Wrestle with the evil
          passions which the Word of God condemns; for in yielding to them, you abase yourself. Repent of sin while
          Mercy’s sweet voice invites you; for it is the ﬁrst step in the noblest work you can do. Strive for the
          mastery with all the powers God hath given you.</p>
      <p>The path of the just is a progressive one, from strength to strength, from grace to grace, and from glory to
          glory. The divine illumination will increase more and more, corresponding with our onward movements,
          qualifying us to meet the responsibilities and emergencies before us.</p>
