    <h1>Why the Great Controversy Was Permitted</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>All Life´s Expiriences Will Be Made Plain</strong></p>
      <p>And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been
          hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers
          in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God. Ephesians 3:9, 10</p>
      <p>For what was the great controversy permitted to continue throughout the ages? Why was it that Satan’s existence
          was not cut short at the outset of his <nobr>rebellion?–It</nobr> was that the universe might be convinced of
          God’s justice in His dealing with evil, that sin might receive eternal condemnation. In the plan of redemption
          there are heights and depths that eternity itself can never exhaust, marvels into which the angels desire to
          look. The redeemed only, of all created beings, have in their own experience known the actual conﬂict with
          sin; they have wrought with Christ, and, as even the angels could not do, have entered into the fellowship of
          His sufferings....</p>
      <p>He “hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places: ...</p>
      <p>that in the ages to come He might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through
          Christ Jesus.”</p>
      <p>As the nations of the saved look upon their Redeemer, and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in His
          countenance; as they behold His throne, which is from everlasting to everlasting, and know that His kingdom is
          to have no end, they break forth in rapturous song....</p>
      <p>Mercy, tenderness, and parental love are seen to blend with holiness, justice, and power. While we behold the
          majesty of His throne, high and lifted up, we see His character in its gracious manifestations, and
          comprehend, as never before, the signiﬁcance of that endearing title, “Our Father.” ...</p>
      <p>The result of the Saviour’s conﬂict with the powers of darkness is joy to the redeemed, redounding to the glory
          of God throughout eternity.</p>
