      <p><strong>Christian Growth</strong></p>
      <p>His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
          him that hath called us to glory and virtue. 2 Peter 1:3</p>
      <p>After receiving the faith of the gospel, our ﬁrst work is to seek to add virtuous and pure principles, and thus
          cleanse the mind and heart for the reception of true knowledge.</p>
      <p>The apostle has presented before us the importance of making continual advancement in the Christian life. There
          is no excuse for our lack of spiritual understanding....</p>
      <p>Faith is the ﬁrst round in the ladder of advancement. Without faith it is impossible to please God. But many
          stop on this round and never ascend higher. They seem to think that when they have professed Christ, when
          their names are on the church record, their work is completed. Faith is essential; but the Inspired Word says,
          “Add to your faith, virtue.” Those who are seeking for eternal life and a home in the kingdom of God must lay
          for their character building the foundation of virtue. Jesus must be the chief cornerstone. The things that
          deﬁle the soul must be banished from the mind and life. When temptations are presented, they must be resisted
          in the strength of Christ. The virtue of the spotless Lamb of God must be woven into the character till the
          soul can stand in its integrity.... Joseph is an</p>
      <p>example of how the youth may stand unspotted, amid the evil of the world, and add to their faith,
          virtue....</p>
      <p>Every moment of our lives is intensely real, and charged with solemn responsibilities. Ignorance will be no
          excuse for lack of spiritual understanding and attainment; for we are exhorted to add to virtue, knowledge....
          The uncultured</p>
      <p>ﬁshermen became men of reﬁnement and ability; and the lessons that they were privileged to learn are written
          for our admonition and instruction. We are invited to become learners in the school of Christ. We need to
          acquire all the knowledge possible.</p>
