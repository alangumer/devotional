    <h1>No Real Joy Apart From Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christians Are Truly Happy</strong></p>
      <p>Enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew 25:23</p>
      <p>The reason why some are restless is that they do not go to the only true source of happiness. They are ever
          trying to ﬁnd out of Christ that enjoyment which is found alone in Him. In Him are no disappointed hopes. Oh,
          how is the precious privilege of prayer neglected! ... Prayer is the strength of the Christian. When alone, he
          is not alone; he feels the presence of the One who said, “Lo, I am with you alway.”</p>
      <p>The young want just what they have not, namely, religion. Nothing can take the place of it.</p>
      <p>The Christian’s hope is just what is needed. Religion will prove to the believer a comforter, a sure guide to
          the Fountain of true happiness.</p>
      <p>There is no true joy except Christ’s joy. All the supposed happiness a man fancies he can gain without Christ
          will prove to be as ashes, a disappointment. Do not suppose for a moment that an irreligious man can be a
          happy man.</p>
      <p>No man can really enjoy life without religion. Love to God puriﬁes and ennobles every taste and every desire,
          intensiﬁes every affection, and brightens every worthy pleasure. It enables men to appreciate and enjoy all
          that is true, and good, and beautiful.</p>
      <p>You will ever ﬁnd with the true Christian a marked cheerfulness, a holy, happy conﬁdence in God, a submission
          to His providences, that is refreshing to the soul.</p>
      <p>Faith in God’s love and overruling providence lightens the burdens of anxiety and care. It ﬁlls the heart with
          joy and contentment in the highest or the lowliest lot. Religion tends directly to promote health, to lengthen
          life, and to heighten our enjoyment of all its blessings. It opens to the soul a <nobr>never-failing</nobr>
          fountain of happiness.</p>
