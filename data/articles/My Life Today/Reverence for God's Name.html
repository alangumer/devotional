    <h1>Reverence for God’s Name</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Holy and reverend is his name. Psalm 111:9</p>
      <p>Reverence should be shown also for the name of God. Never should that name be spoken lightly or thoughtlessly.
          Even in prayer its frequent or needless repetition should be avoided.</p>
      <p>Those who are brought into covenant relation with God are pledged to speak of Him in the most respectful,
          reverential manner....</p>
      <p>Swearing, and all words spoken in the form of an oath, are dishonoring to God. The Lord sees, the Lord hears,
          and He will not hold the transgressor guiltless. He will not be mocked. Those who take the name of the Lord in
          vain will ﬁnd it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
      <p>By the thoughtless mention of God in common conversation, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the
          frequent and thoughtless repetition of His name, we dishonor Him.</p>
      <p>What faint views some have of the holiness of God, and how much they take His holy and reverend name in vain,
          without realizing that it is God, the great and terrible God, of whom they are speaking. While praying, many
          use careless and irreverent expressions, which grieve the tender Spirit of the Lord and cause their petitions
          to be shut out of heaven.</p>
      <p>“Holy and reverend is His name.” We are never in any manner to treat lightly the titles or appellations of the
          Deity. In prayer we enter the audience chamber of the Most High, and we should come before Him with holy awe.
          The angels veil their faces in His presence. The cherubim and the bright and holy seraphim approach His throne
          with solemn reverence. How much more should we, ﬁnite, sinful beings, come in a reverent manner before the
          Lord, our Maker!</p>
