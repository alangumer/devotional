      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and
          worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. Psalm 15:1, 2</p>
      <p>We must present the principles of truth, and let them work upon the hearts of the people. We may pick the
          leaves from a tree as often as we please, but this will not cause the tree to die; the next season the leaves
          will come out again as thick as before. But strike the ax at the root of the tree, and not only will the
          leaves fall off of themselves, but the tree will die. Those who accept the truth, in the love of it, will die
          to the world, and will become meek and lowly in heart like their divine Lord. Just as soon as the heart is
          right, the dress, the conversation, the life, will be in harmony with the Word of God. We all need to humble
          ourselves under the mighty hand of God. May He help us to plant our feet ﬁrmly upon the platform of eternal
          truth.</p>
      <p>The transforming inﬂuence of truth sanctiﬁes the soul. He loves the commandments of God. His fear and
          condemnation are one. The love of Christ, expressed in His great sacriﬁce to save man, has broken every
          barrier down. The love of God ﬂows into the soul, and gratitude springs up in the heart that was as cold as a
          stone. Christ cruciﬁed, Christ our righteousness, wins the heart and brings it to repentance. This theme is so
          simple that children can grasp it, the wise and learned are charmed with it, while they behold it in its
          depths of wisdom, love, and power which they can never fathom. We want to present this precious truth to the
          people who are bound in sin. Let all see that Christ was slain for their transgressions, that He desires to
          save them.</p>
      <p>Let us remember that there is need of sanctiﬁed pens and sanctiﬁed tongues. When we as a people live as God
          would be pleased to have us live, we shall see the deep movings of His Spirit. Much will then be done for
          those who have never heard the truth.</p>
      <p>We should be pervaded with a deep, abiding sense of the value, sanctity, and the authority of the truth.</p>
