    <h1>December—An Eternal Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Make Your Calling and Election Sure</strong></p>
      <p>Prepering for Eternal Life</p>
      <p>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these
          things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting
          kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:10, 11</p>
      <p>Here a life insurance policy is offered us which insures for us eternal life in the kingdom of God. I ask you
          to study these words of the apostle Peter. There is understanding and intelligence in every sentence. By
          taking hold upon the Lifegiver, who gave His life for us, we receive eternal life.</p>
      <p>We are each deciding our eternal destiny, and it rests wholly with us whether we shall gain eternal life. Will
          we live the lessons given in the Word of God, Christ’s great lesson book? It is the grandest, and yet the most
          simply arranged and easily understood book ever prepared for giving an education in proper behaviour, in
          speech, in manners, in affection. It is the only book that will prepare human beings for the life that
          measures with the life of God. And those who make this Word their daily study are the only ones who are worthy
          of receiving a diploma entitling them to educate and train the children for entrance into the higher school,
          to be crowned as victorious overcomers.</p>
      <p>Christ Jesus is the only judge of the ﬁtness of human agents to receive eternal life. The gates of the holy
          city will open to those who have been humble, meek, lowly followers of His, having learned their lessons from
          Him, and received from Him their life insurance policy, forming characters after the divine similitude.</p>
      <p>When the ransomed are redeemed from the earth, the city of God will be opened to you.... Then the harp will be
          placed in your hand, and your voice will</p>
      <p>be raised in songs of praise to God and to the Lamb, by whose great sacriﬁce you are made partakers of His
          nature and given an immortal inheritance in the kingdom of God.</p>
