    <h1>Truth Will Triumph Gloriously</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. Isaiah 26:2</p>
      <p>The truth of God must be enshrined in the heart, and we must be determined to ﬁght the battles of the Lord, if
          we would come off conquerors with the ﬁnal triumph of the truth; for the truth will triumph gloriously.... If
          you are seeking to</p>
      <p>be a blessing to others, God will bless you. We should bring all the good possible into our lives, that we may
          glorify God and be a blessing to humanity.</p>
      <p>The church is God’s agency for the proclamation of truth, empowered by Him to do a special work; and if she is
          loyal to Him, obedient to all His commandments, there will dwell within her the excellency of divine grace. If
          she will be true to her allegiance, if she will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is no power that can stand
          against her.</p>
      <p>Zeal for God and His cause moved the disciples to bear witness to the gospel with mighty power. Should not a
          like zeal ﬁre our hearts with a determination to tell the story of redeeming love, of Christ and Him cruciﬁed?
          It is the privilege of every Christian not only to look for but to hasten the coming of the Saviour.</p>
      <p>If the church will put on the robe of Christ’s righteousness, withdrawing from all allegiance with the world,
          there is before her the dawn of a bright and glorious day. God’s promise to her will stand fast forever. He
          will make her an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. Truth, passing by those who despise and reject
          it, will triumph. Although at times apparently retarded, its progress has never been checked. When the message
          of God meets with opposition, He gives it additional force, that it may exert greater inﬂuence. Endowed with
          divine energy, it will cut its way through the strongest barriers, and triumph over every obstacle.</p>
