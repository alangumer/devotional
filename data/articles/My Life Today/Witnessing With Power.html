      <p><strong>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>With great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them
          all. Acts 4:33</p>
      <p>What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit? Thousands were converted in a day. The sword of the
          Spirit, newly edged with power and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way through unbelief,
          overcoming Satanic agencies and magnifying the Lord as possessing supreme power.</p>
      <p>Everywhere the gospel was proclaimed. Those who proclaimed it had no grievous complaints to make. The hearts of
          the disciples were surcharged with a benevolence so full, so deep, so far reaching, that it impelled them to
          go to the ends of the earth, testifying, God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
          Christ. As they proclaimed the gospel as the power of God unto salvation, hearts yielded to the power of the
          Holy Spirit. New territory was daily added to the church. In every place converts confessed Christ. Those who
          had been the bitterest opponents of the truth became her champions....</p>
      <p>The disciples ... were weighted with the burden for the salvation of souls. The gospel was to be carried to the
          uttermost parts of the earth, and they claimed the endowment of the power that Christ had promised. Then it
          was that the Holy Spirit was poured out, and thousands were converted in a day.</p>
      <p>So may it be now. Instead of man’s speculations, let the Word of God be preached. Let Christians put away their
          dissensions and give themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for the blessing, and
          it will come.</p>
      <p>Zeal for God moved the disciples to bear witness to the truth with mighty power. Should not this zeal ﬁre our
          hearts with a determination to tell the story of redeeming love, of Christ, and Him cruciﬁed?</p>
