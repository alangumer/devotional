      <p><strong>Angel Guidance in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have
          prepared. Exodus 23:20</p>
      <p>All heaven is engaged in the work of preparing a people to stand in the day of the Lord’s preparation. The
          connection of heaven with earth seems very close....</p>
      <p>The heavenly intelligences are waiting with almost impatient earnestness to make Him known to the human agents,
          that they may be laborers together with these heavenly angels in presenting <nobr>Jesus–the</nobr> world’s
          Redeemer, full of grace and truth....</p>
      <p>The ﬁrst tear of penitence for sins creates joy among the heavenly angels in the courts of heaven. The heavenly
          messengers are ready to be on the wing to minister to the soul who is seeking Jesus....</p>
      <p>Grand and glorious things hath God prepared for those who love Him. Angels are looking forward with earnest
          expectation to the ﬁnal triumph of the people of God, when seraphim and cherubim and the “ten thousand times
          ten thousand, and thousands of thousands” shall swell the anthems of the blessed and celebrate the triumphs of
          the mediatorial achievements in the recovery of man.</p>
      <p>Jesus counted the cost of the salvation of every son and daughter of Adam. He provided abundant means that, if
          they would but comply with the conditions, none need perish, but might have everlasting life.... Every
          heavenly intelligence</p>
      <p>works as His agent to win man to God.</p>
      <p>The angels of glory ﬁnd their joy in ... giving love and tireless watchcare to souls that are fallen and
          unholy. Heavenly beings woo the hearts of men; they bring to this dark world light from the courts above; by
          gentle and patient ministry they move upon the human spirit, to bring the lost into a fellowship with Christ
          which is even closer than they themselves can know.</p>
