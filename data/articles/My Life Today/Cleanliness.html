      <p><strong>Keeping Physically Fit</strong></p>
      <p>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
          conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Hebrews 10:22</p>
      <p>Scrupulous cleanliness is essential to both physical and mental health. Impurities are constantly thrown off
          from the body through the skin. Its millions of pores are quickly clogged unless kept clean by frequent
          bathing, and the impurities which should pass off through the skin become an additional burden to the other
          eliminating organs.... A bath, properly taken, fortiﬁes against cold,</p>
      <p>because it improves the circulation; the blood is brought to the surface, and a more easy and regular ﬂow is
          obtained. The mind and the body are alike invigorated. The muscles become more ﬂexible, the intellect is made
          brighter. The bath is a soother of the nerves.</p>
      <p>Teach the little ones that God is not pleased to see them with unclean bodies and untidy, torn garments....
          Having the clothing neat and clean will be one means</p>
      <p>of keeping the thoughts pure and sweet.... Especially should every article which</p>
      <p>comes in contact with the skin be kept clean.</p>
      <p>Truth never places her delicate feet in a path of uncleanness or impurity....</p>
      <p>He who was so particular that the children of Israel should cherish habits of cleanliness will not sanction any
          impurity in the homes of His people today. God looks with disfavor on uncleanness of any kind.</p>
      <p>Unclean, neglected corners in the house will tend to make impure, neglected corners in the soul.</p>
      <p>Perfect cleanliness, plenty of sunlight, careful attention to sanitation in every detail of the home life, are
          essential to freedom from disease and to the cheerfulness and vigor of the inmates of the home.</p>
      <p>Heaven is pure and holy, and those who pass through the gates of the city of God must here be clothed with
          inward and outward purity.</p>
