      <p>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. Isaiah
          26:3</p>
      <p>There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care because they seek to reach the world’s standard.
          They have chosen its service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its customs. Thus their character is marred
          and their life made a weariness. In order to gratify ambition and worldly desires, they wound the conscience
          and bring upon themselves an additional burden of remorse. The continual worry is wearing out the life forces.
          Our Lord desires them to lay aside this yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept His yoke; He says, “My yoke
          is easy, and My burden is light.” He bids them seek ﬁrst the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and His
          promise is that all things needful to them for this life shall be added. Worry is blind, and cannot discern
          the future; but Jesus sees the end from the beginning. In every difﬁculty He has His way prepared to bring
          relief. Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us, of which we know nothing. Those who accept
          the one principle of making the service and honor of God supreme will ﬁnd perplexities vanish, and a plain
          path before their feet....</p>
      <p>In the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony with God, there was perfect peace. He was never elated by
          applause or dejected by censure or disappointment. Amid the greatest opposition and the most cruel treatment
          He was still of good courage.</p>
      <p>True happiness is found ... in learning of Christ.... Those who take Christ at</p>
      <p>His Word and surrender the soul to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will ﬁnd peace and quietude.
          Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence.</p>
