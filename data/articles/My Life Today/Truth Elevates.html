      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to
          give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctiﬁed. Acts 20:32</p>
      <p>The precious faith inspired of God imparts strength and nobility of character. As His goodness, His mercy, and
          His love are dwelt upon, clearer and still clearer will be the perception of truth; higher, holier the desire
          for purity of heart and clearness of thought. The soul dwelling in the atmosphere of holy thought is
          transformed by intercourse with God through the study of His Word. Truth is so large, so far reaching, so
          deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of. The heart is softened and subdued into humility, kindness, and
          love.</p>
      <p>The natural powers are enlarged because of holy obedience. From the study of the words of life, students may
          come forth with minds expanded, elevated, ennobled.... Being <nobr>pure-minded,</nobr> they will become
          <nobr>strong-minded.</nobr></p>
      <p>Every intellectual faculty will be quickened. They may so educate and discipline themselves that all within the
          sphere of their inﬂuence may see what man can be, and what he can do, when connected with the God of wisdom
          and power.</p>
      <p>The truth of God never degrades the receiver. The inﬂuence of the truth upon him who accepts it will tend
          constantly to his elevation....</p>
      <p>Those who are sanctiﬁed through the truth are living recommendations of its power and representatives of their
          risen Lord. The religion of Christ will reﬁne the taste, sanctify the judgment, elevate, purify, and ennoble
          the soul, making the Christian more and more ﬁt for the society of the heavenly angels.</p>
      <p>God bids us ﬁll our minds with great thoughts, pure thoughts.... No one with a</p>
      <p>spirit to appreciate its teachings can read a single passage from the Bible without gaining from it some
          helpful thought.</p>
