      <p><strong>Saved to Serve</strong></p>
      <p>His disciples came to him, saying, ... Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
          themselves victuals. But Jesus said unto them, ... Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, We have here
          but ﬁve loaves, and two ﬁshes. He said, Bring them hither to me.... And looking up</p>
      <p>to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude....
          And they took up of fragments that remained</p>
      <p>twelve baskets full. Matthew <nobr>14:15-20</nobr></p>
      <p>In this parable is wrapped up a deep, spiritual lesson for God’s workers.... In</p>
      <p>full reliance upon God, Jesus took the small store of loaves; and although there was but a small supply for His
          own family of disciples, He did not invite them to eat, but began to distribute to them, bidding them serve
          the people. The food multiplied in His hands; and the hands of the disciples, reaching out to Christ, Himself
          the Bread of Life, were never empty. The little store was sufﬁcient for all. After the wants of the people had
          been supplied, the fragments were gathered up, and Christ and His disciples ate of the precious,
          <nobr>Heaven-supplied</nobr> food.</p>
      <p>The disciples were the channel of communication between Christ and the people. This should be a great
          encouragement to His disciples today. Christ is the great Center, the Source of all strength. His disciples
          are to receive their supplies from Him.... As we continue to impart, we shall continue to receive; and</p>
      <p>the more we impart, the more we shall receive....</p>
      <p>Mark that pool which receives the showers of heaven but has no outlet. It is a blessing to no one, but in
          stagnant selﬁshness poisons the air around. Now look at the stream ﬂowing from the mountainside, refreshing
          the thirsty land through which it passes. What blessing it brings! One would think that in giving so liberally
          it would exhaust its resources. But not so. It is a part of God’s great plan that the stream that gives shall
          never lack; and day by day and year by year it ﬂows on its way, ever receiving and ever giving.</p>
