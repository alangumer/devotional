      <p><strong>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was
          lightened with his glory. Revelation 18:1</p>
      <p>The end of all things is at hand. God is moving upon every mind that is open to receive the impressions of His
          Holy Spirit. He is sending our messengers that they may give the warning in every locality. God is testing the
          devotion of His churches and their willingness to render obedience to the Spirit’s guidance. Knowledge is to
          be increased. The messengers of Heaven are to be seen running to and fro, seeking in every possible way to
          warn the people of the coming judgments and presenting the glad tidings of salvation through our Lord Jesus
          Christ. The standard of righteousness is to be exalted. The Spirit of God is moving upon men’s hearts, and
          those who respond to its inﬂuence will become lights in the world. Everywhere they are seen going forth to
          communicate to others the light they have received as they did after the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day
          of Pentecost. And as they let their light shine, they receive more and more of the Spirit’s power. The earth
          is lighted with the glory of God.</p>
      <p>This message will close with power and strength far exceeding the midnight cry. Servants of God, endowed with
          power from on high, with their faces lighted up, and shining with holy consecration, went forth to proclaim
          the message from heaven.</p>
      <p>Many were praising God. The sick were healed, and other miracles were wrought. A spirit of intercession was
          seen, even as was manifested before the great Day of Pentecost. Hundreds and thousands were seen visiting
          families and opening before them the Word of God. Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a
          spirit of genuine conversion was manifest. On every side doors were thrown open to the proclamation of the
          truth. The world seemed to be lightened with the heavenly inﬂuence.</p>
