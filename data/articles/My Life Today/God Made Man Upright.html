      <p><strong>Keeping Physically Fit</strong></p>
      <p>God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. Ecclesiastes 7:29</p>
      <p>The health reform is an important part of the third angel’s message; and as a people professing this reform, we
          should not retrograde, but make continual advancement. It is a great thing to ensure health by placing
          ourselves in right relations to the laws of life.</p>
      <p>Among the ﬁrst things to be aimed at should be a correct position, both in sitting and in standing. God made
          man upright, and He desires him to possess not only the physical but the mental and moral beneﬁt, the grace
          and dignity and <nobr>self-possession,</nobr> the courage and <nobr>self-reliance,</nobr> which an erect
          bearing so greatly tends to promote.</p>
      <p>The lungs should be allowed the greatest freedom possible. Their capacity is developed by free action; it
          diminishes if they are cramped and compressed. Hence the ill effects of the practice so common, especially in
          sedentary pursuits of stooping at one’s work. In this position it is impossible to breathe deeply. Superﬁcial
          breathing soon becomes a habit, and the lungs lose their power to expand.... Thus an insufﬁcient supply of
          oxygen is received. The blood moves</p>
      <p>sluggishly.</p>
      <p>Next in importance to right position are respiration and vocal culture. The one who sits and stands erect is
          more likely than others to breathe properly.... To</p>
      <p>ensure correct delivery in reading and speaking, see that the abdominal muscles have full play in breathing,
          and that the respiratory organs are unrestricted. Let the strain come on the muscles of the abdomen rather
          than on those of the throat. Great weariness and serious disease of the throat and lungs may thus be
          prevented.</p>
      <p>In order to enjoy good health, we must ask the Lord to bless us, and then do what we can to place ourselves
          under conditions the most favorable to health.</p>
