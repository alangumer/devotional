      <p><strong>Elements of Good Health</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh
          of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a
          well of water springing up into everlasting life. John 4:13, 14</p>
      <p>In health and in sickness pure water is one of Heaven’s choicest blessings. Its proper use promotes health. It
          is the beverage which God provided to quench the thirst of animals and man. Drunk freely, it helps to supply
          the necessities of the system and assists nature to resist disease. The external application of water is one
          of the easiest and most satisfactory ways of regulating the circulation of the blood.</p>
      <p>Pure water to drink and fresh air to breathe invigorate the vital organs, purify the blood, and help nature in
          her task of overcoming the bad conditions of the system.</p>
      <p>Water is the best liquid possible to cleanse the tissues.</p>
      <p>If those who are afﬂicted would assist nature in her efforts by the use of pure, soft water, much suffering
          would be prevented.</p>
      <p>Water treatments, wisely and skillfully given, may be the means of saving many lives. Let diligent study be
          united with careful treatments. Let prayers of faith be offered by the bedside of the sick. Let the sick be
          encouraged to claim the promises of God for themselves.</p>
      <p>The refreshing water, welling up in a parched and barren land, causing the desert place to blossom and ﬂowing
          out to give life to the perishing, is an emblem of the divine grace which Christ alone can bestow, and which
          is as the living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul.</p>
