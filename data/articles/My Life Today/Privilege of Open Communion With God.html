    <h1>Privilege of Open Communion With God</h1>

      <p><strong>All Life´s Expiriences Will Be Made Plain</strong></p>
      <p>I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. Revelation 21:22</p>
      <p>The people of God are privileged to hold open communion with the Father and the Son. “Now we see through a
          glass, darkly.” We behold the image of God reﬂected, as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His
          dealings with men; but then we shall see Him face to face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in
          His presence and behold the glory of His countenance.</p>
      <p>We may address Him by the endearing name, “Our Father,” which is a sign of our affection for Him and a pledge
          of His tender regard and relationship to us. And the Son of God, beholding the heirs of grace, “is not ashamed
          to call them brethren.” They have even a more sacred relationship to God than have the angels who have never
          fallen.</p>
      <p>All the paternal love which has come down from generation to generation through the channel of human hearts,
          all the springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill to the boundless
          ocean when compared with the inﬁnite, exhaustless love of God.</p>
      <p>Heaven is a ceaseless approaching to God through Christ. The longer we are in the heaven of bliss, the more and
          still more of glory will be opened to us; and the more we know of God, the more intense will be our
          happiness.</p>
      <p>And what is the happiness of heaven but to see God? What greater joy could come to the sinner saved by the
          grace of Christ than to look upon the face of God and know Him as Father?</p>
      <p>How much comfort it gives to behold Him here by the eye of faith, that we may by beholding be made like Him,
          but what will it be to behold Him as He is, without one dimming veil between?</p>
