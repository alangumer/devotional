      <p><strong>The Work of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things,
          and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John 14:26</p>
      <p>Christ has risen from the dead, proclaiming over the rent sepulcher, “I am the resurrection and the life.” He
          has sent His Spirit into our world to bring all things to our remembrance. By a miracle of His power He has
          preserved His Written Word through the ages. Shall we not, then, make this Word our constant study, learning
          from it God’s purpose for us.</p>
      <p>The servants of Christ were to prepare no set speech to present when brought to trial. Their preparation was to
          be made day by day in treasuring up the precious truths of God’s Word, and through prayer strengthening their
          faith. When they were brought into trial, the Holy Spirit would bring to their remembrance the very truths
          that would be needed....</p>
      <p>A daily, earnest striving to know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, would bring power and efﬁciency to
          the soul. The knowledge obtained by diligent searching of the Scriptures, would be ﬂashed into the memory at
          the right time. But if any had neglected to acquaint themselves with the words of Christ, if they had never
          tested the power of His grace in trial, they could not expect that the Holy Spirit would bring His words to
          their remembrance.</p>
      <p>Christ has made every provision for us to be strong. He has given us His Holy Spirit, whose ofﬁce is to bring
          to our remembrance all the promises that Christ has made, that we may have peace and a sweet sense of
          forgiveness. If we will but keep our eyes ﬁxed on the Saviour and trust in His power, we shall be ﬁlled with a
          sense of security; for the righteousness of Christ will become our righteousness.</p>
