      <p><strong>Guarding the Avenues to the Soul</strong></p>
      <p>“I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to
          me. Psalm 101:3</p>
      <p>All should guard the senses, lest Satan gain victory over them; for these are the avenues to the soul.</p>
      <p>Avoid reading and seeing things which will suggest impure thoughts. Cultivate the moral and intellectual
          powers.</p>
      <p>Among the most dangerous resorts of pleasure is the theater. Instead of being a school of morality and virtue,
          as is so often claimed, it is the very hotbed of immorality. Vicious habits and sinful propensities are
          strengthened and conﬁrmed by these entertainments. Low songs, lewd gestures, expressions, and attitudes
          deprave the imagination and debase the morals. Every youth who habitually attends such exhibitions will be
          corrupted in principle. There is no inﬂuence in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to destroy
          religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of life than
          theatrical amusements.</p>
      <p>The love for these scenes increases with every indulgence, as the desire for intoxicating drink strengthens
          with its use. The only safe course is to shun the theater, the circus, and every other questionable place of
          amusement.</p>
      <p>There are modes of recreation which are highly beneﬁcial to both mind and body. An enlightened, discriminating
          mind will ﬁnd abundant means for entertainment and diversion, from sources not only innocent, but
          instructive....</p>
      <p>The great God whose glory shines from the heavens, and whose divine hand upholds millions of worlds, is our
          Father. We have only to love Him, trust in Him, as little children in faith and conﬁdence, and He will accept
          us as His sons and daughters, and we shall be heirs to all the inexpressible glory of the eternal world.</p>
