    <h1>Visit Fatherless and Widows</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Pure Religion Deﬁned</strong></p>
      <p>Pure religion and undeﬁled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and the widows in their
          afﬂiction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. James 1:27</p>
      <p>Among all whose needs demand our interest, the widow and the fatherless have the strongest claims upon our
          tender sympathy and care....</p>
      <p>The father who has died in the faith, resting upon the eternal promise of God, left his loved ones in full
          trust that the Lord would care for them. And how does the Lord provide for these bereaved ones? He does not
          work a miracle in sending manna from heaven, He does not send ravens to bring them food; but He works a
          miracle upon human hearts, He expels selﬁshness from the soul, He unseals the fountain of benevolence. He
          tests the love of His professed followers by committing to their tender mercies the afﬂicted and bereaved
          ones, the poor and the orphan.</p>
      <p>Many a widowed mother with her fatherless children is bravely striving to bear her double burden, often toiling
          far beyond her strength in order to keep her little ones with her and to provide for their needs. Little time
          has she for their training and instruction, little opportunity to surround them with inﬂuences that would
          brighten their lives. She needs encouragement, sympathy, and tangible help. God calls upon us to supply to
          these children, so far as we can, the want of a father’s care.... Seek to aid the careworn mother.</p>
      <p>In homes supplied with life’s comforts, in bins and granaries ﬁlled with the yield of abundant harvests, in
          warehouses stocked with the products of the loom, and vaults stored with gold and silver, God has supplied
          means for the sustenance of these needy ones.</p>
      <p>Those who have pity for the ... widows, the orphans, and the needy, Christ represents as commandment keepers,
          who shall have eternal life.</p>
