      <p><strong>Emotional Maturity Brings Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth
          God. 1 John 4:7</p>
      <p>From the Christian standpoint, love is power. Intellectual and spiritual strength are involved in this
          principle. Pure love has special efﬁcacy to do good, and can do nothing but good. It prevents discord and
          misery and brings the truest happiness. Wealth is often an inﬂuence to corrupt and destroy; force is strong to
          do hurt; but truth and goodness are the properties of pure love.</p>
      <p>A man at peace with God and his fellow men cannot be made miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil
          surmising will ﬁnd no room there; hatred cannot exist. The heart in harmony with God is lifted above the
          annoyances and trials of this life.</p>
      <p>That which Satan plants in the <nobr>heart–envy,</nobr> jealousy, evil surmising, evil speaking, impatience,
          prejudice, selﬁshness, covetousness, and <nobr>vanity–must</nobr> be uprooted. If these evil things are
          allowed to remain in the soul, they will bear fruit by which many shall be deﬁled. Oh, how many cultivate the
          poisonous plants, that kill out the precious fruits of love and deﬁle the soul!</p>
      <p>Only the love that ﬂows from the heart of Christ can heal. Only He in whom that love ﬂows, even as the sap in
          the tree or the blood in the body, can restore the wounded soul.</p>
      <p>Love’s agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine. The soft answer that “turneth away wrath,” the love
          that “suffereth long, and is kind,” the charity that “covereth a multitude of <nobr>sins”–would</nobr> we
          learn the lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted! How life would be transformed, and
          the earth become a very likeness and foretaste of heaven!</p>
