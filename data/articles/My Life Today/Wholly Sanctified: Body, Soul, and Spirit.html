    <h1>September—A Sanctiﬁed Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wholly Sanctiﬁed: Body, Soul, and Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Sanctiﬁcation</p>
      <p>The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
          blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thessalonians 5:23</p>
      <p>The sanctiﬁcation set forth in the Sacred Scriptures has to do with the entire <nobr>being–spirit,</nobr> soul,
          and body. Here is the true idea of entire consecration. Paul prays that the church at Thessalonica may enjoy
          this great blessing. “The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and
          body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” 1 Thessalonians 5:23....</p>
      <p>True sanctiﬁcation is an entire conformity to the will of God. Rebellious thoughts and feelings are overcome,
          and the voice of Jesus awakens a new life, which pervades the entire being. Those who are truly sanctiﬁed will
          not set up their own opinion as a standard of right and wrong. They are not bigoted or
          <nobr>self-righteous;</nobr> but they are jealous of self, ever fearing, lest a promise being left them, they
          should come short of complying with the conditions upon which the promises are based....</p>
      <p>Bible sanctiﬁcation does not consist in strong emotion. Here is where many are led into error. They make
          feelings their criterion. When they feel elated or happy, they claim that they are sanctiﬁed. Happy feelings
          or the absence of joy is no evidence that a person is or is not sanctiﬁed. There is no such thing as
          instantaneous sanctiﬁcation. True sanctiﬁcation is a daily work, continuing as long as life shall last. Those
          who are battling with daily temptations, <nobr>over-coming</nobr> their own sinful tendencies, and seeking for
          holiness of heart and life make no boastful claims of holiness. They are hungering and thirsting for
          righteousness. Sin appears to them exceedingly sinful.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Genuine sanctiﬁcation ... is nothing less than a daily dying to self and daily conformity to the will of
          God.</p>
