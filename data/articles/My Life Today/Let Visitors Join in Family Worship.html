      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew
          forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter 2:9</p>
      <p>In a sense the father is the priest of the household, laying upon the family altar the morning and evening
          sacriﬁce. But the wife and children should unite in prayer and join in the song of praise. In the morning
          before he leaves home for his daily labor let the father gather his children about him and, bowing before God,
          commit them to the care of the Father in heaven. When the cares of the day are past, let the family unite in
          offering grateful prayer and raising the song of praise, in acknowledgment of divine care during the day....
          Do not fail to gather</p>
      <p>your family around God’s altar.</p>
      <p>In our efforts for the comfort and happiness of guests let us not overlook our obligations to God. The hour of
          prayer should not be neglected for any consideration. Do not talk and amuse yourselves till all are too weary
          to enjoy the season of devotion. To do this is to present to God a lame offering. At an early hour of the
          evening, when we can pray unhurriedly and understandingly, we should present our supplications and raise our
          voices in happy, grateful praise.</p>
      <p>Let all who visit Christians see that the hour of prayer is the most precious, the most sacred, and the
          happiest hour of the day. These seasons of devotion exert a reﬁning, elevating inﬂuence upon all who
          participate in them. They bring a peace and rest grateful to the spirit.</p>
      <p>A lamp, however small, if kept steadily burning, may be the means of lighting many other lamps.... Wonderful
          opportunities are ours through a faithful use of</p>
      <p>the opportunities of our own homes. If we will open our hearts and homes to the divine principles of life, we
          shall become channels for currents of <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power. From our homes will ﬂow streams of
          healing, bringing life, and beauty, and fruitfulness where now are barrenness and dearth.</p>
