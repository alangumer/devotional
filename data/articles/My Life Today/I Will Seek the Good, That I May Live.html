      <p>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you. Amos 5:14</p>
      <p>Satan is using every means to make crime and debasing vice popular. We cannot walk the streets of our cities
          without encountering ï¬‚aring notices of crime presented in some novel or to be acted at some theater. The mind
          is educated to familiarity with sin. The course pursued by the base and vile is kept before the people in the
          periodicals of the day, and everything that can excite passion is brought before them in exciting stories.
          They hear and read so much of debasing crime that the once tender conscience, which would have recoiled with
          horror from such scenes, becomes hardened, and they dwell upon these things with greedy interest.</p>
      <p>Many of the amusements popular in the world today, even with those who claim to be Christians, tend to the same
          end as did those of the heathen. There are indeed few among them that Satan does not turn to account in
          destroying souls. Through the drama he has worked for ages to excite passion and glorify vice. The opera, with
          its fascinating display and bewildering music, the masquerade, the dance, the card table, Satan employs to
          break down the barriers of principle and open the door to sensual indulgence. In every gathering for pleasure
          where pride is fostered or appetite indulged, where one is led to forget God and lose sight of eternal
          interests, there Satan is binding his chains about the soul.</p>
      <p>Our only safety is to be shielded by the grace of God every moment, and not put out our own spiritual eyesight
          so that we will call evil, good, and good, evil. Without hesitation or argument, we must close and guard the
          avenues of the soul against evil.</p>
