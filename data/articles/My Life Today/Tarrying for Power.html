      <p><strong>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. Luke 24:49</p>
      <p>Every truly converted soul will be intensely desirous to bring others from the darkness of error into the
          marvelous light of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. The great outpouring of the Spirit of God, which
          lightens the whole earth with His glory, will not come until we have an enlightened people, that know by
          experience what it means to be laborers together with God. When we have entire, wholehearted consecration to
          the service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but this
          will not be while the largest portion of the church are not laborers together with God. God cannot pour out
          His Spirit when selﬁshness and <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> are so manifest; when a spirit prevails that, if
          put into words, would express that answer of <nobr>Cain–“Am</nobr> I my brother’s keeper?” ...</p>
      <p>When the hearts of the believers are warm with the love for God, they will do a continual work for Jesus. They
          will manifest the meekness of Christ and display a steadfast purpose that will not fail nor be discouraged.
          God will use humble men to do His work, for there is a large vineyard calling for laborers.</p>
      <p>The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race. Christ declared that the divine
          inﬂuence of His Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost to the present
          time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service....
          The</p>
      <p>more closely believers have walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they testiﬁed of their
          Redeemer’s love and of His saving grace. The men and women who through the long centuries of persecution and
          trial enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives, have stood as signs and wonders in
          the world.</p>
