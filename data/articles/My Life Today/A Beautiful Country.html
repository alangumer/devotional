    <h1>A Beautiful Country</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Heavens Is a Real and Wonderful Place</strong></p>
      <p>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity
          to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to
          be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. Hebrews 11:15, 16</p>
      <p>A fear of making the future inheritance seem too material has led many to spiritualize away the very truths
          which lead us to look upon it as our home. Christ assured His disciples that He went to prepare mansions for
          them in the Father’s house. Those who accept the teachings of God’s Word will not be wholly ignorant
          concerning the heavenly abode. And yet “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
          of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.” Human language is inadequate to describe
          the reward of the righteous. It will be known only to those who behold it. No ﬁnite mind can comprehend the
          glory of the Paradise of God.</p>
      <p>In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called a country. There the heavenly Shepherd leads His ﬂock to
          fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for
          the service of the nations. There are <nobr>ever-ﬂowing</nobr> streams, clear as crystal, and beside them
          waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord.</p>
      <p>The grass will be a living green, and will never wither. There will be roses and lilies and all kinds of ﬂowers
          there. They will never blight or fade or lose their beauty and fragrance.</p>
      <p>The lion, we should much dread and fear here, will then lie down with the lamb, and everything in the New Earth
          will be peace and harmony. The trees of the New Earth will be straight and lofty, without deformity.</p>
      <p>In the New Earth there are no chilling winds, no disagreeable changes. The atmosphere is ever right and
          healthful.</p>
