      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. Job 22:22</p>
      <p>It is of the greatest importance that you continually search the Scriptures, storing the mind with the truths
          of God. You may be separated from the companionship of Christians and placed where you will not have the
          privilege of meeting with the children of God. You need the treasures of God’s Word hidden in your heart.</p>
      <p>All over the ﬁeld of revelation are scattered grains of <nobr>gold–the</nobr> sayings of the wisdom of God. If
          you are wise, you will gather up these precious grains of truth. Make the promises of God your own. Then when
          test and trial come, these promises will be to you glad springs of heavenly comfort.</p>
      <p>Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the
          tempted one cannot readily remember God’s promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are
          round about those who are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great necessity they will
          bring to their remembrance the very truths which are needed. Thus “when the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood,
          the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.”</p>
      <p>The heart that is stored with the precious truths of God’s Word is fortiﬁed against the temptation of Satan,
          against impure thoughts and unholy actions.</p>
      <p>Keep close to the Scriptures. The more you search and explain the Word, the more your mind and heart will be
          fortiﬁed with the blessed words of encouragement and promise.</p>
      <p>Let us commit its precious promises to memory, so that, when we are deprived of our Bibles, we may still be in
          possession of the Word of God.</p>
