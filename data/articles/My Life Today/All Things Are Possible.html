      <p><strong>Faith in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>All things are possible to him that believeth. Mark 9:23</p>
      <p>It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In
          Christ, God has provided means for subduing every evil trait, and resisting every temptation, however
          strong.</p>
      <p>The righteous have ever obtained help from above. How often have the enemies of God united their strength and
          wisdom to destroy the character and inﬂuence of a few simple persons who trusted in God. But because the Lord
          was for them, none could prevail against them.... Let them be separated from their</p>
      <p>idols and from the world, and the world will not separate them from God. Christ is our present,
          <nobr>all-sufﬁcient</nobr> Saviour. In Him all fullness dwells. It is the privilege of Christians to know
          indeed that Christ is in them of a truth. “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” All
          things are possible to him that believeth; and whatsoever things we desire when we pray, if we believe that we
          receive them we shall have them. This faith will penetrate the darkest cloud and bring rays of light and hope
          to the drooping, desponding soul. It is the absence of this faith and trust which brings perplexity,
          distressing fears, and surmisings of evil. God will do great things for His people when they put their entire
          trust in Him.</p>
      <p>Through faith God’s children have “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the
          mouths of lions, quenched the violence of ﬁre, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made
          strong, waxed valiant in ﬁght, turned to ﬂight the armies of the aliens.” And through faith we today are to
          reach the heights of God’s purpose for us.</p>
