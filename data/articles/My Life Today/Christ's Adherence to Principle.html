    <h1>Christ’s Adherence to Principle</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Living by Principle Not Inclination</strong></p>
      <p>In the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
          heart. Psalm 40:7, 8</p>
      <p>The life of Christ was distinguished from the generality of children. His strength of moral character and His
          ﬁrmness ever led Him to be true to His sense of duty and to adhere to the principles of right, from which no
          motive, however powerful, could move Him. Money or pleasure, applause or censure, could not purchase or ﬂatter
          Him to consent to a wrong action. He was strong to resist temptation, wise to discover evil, and ﬁrm to abide
          faithful to His convictions.</p>
      <p>The wicked and unprincipled would ﬂatter and portray the pleasures of sinful indulgences, but His strength of
          principle was strong to resist the suggestions of Satan. His penetration had been cultivated, that He could
          discern the voice of the tempter. He would not swerve from duty to obtain the favor of any. He would not sell
          His principles for human praise or to avoid reproach and the envy and hatred of those who were enemies of
          righteousness and true goodness.</p>
      <p>He took pleasure in discharging His obligations to His parents and to society, without yielding His principles
          or being contaminated with the impure inﬂuence surrounding Him at Nazareth.</p>
      <p>Never did Christ deviate from loyalty to the principles of God’s law. Never did He do anything contrary to the
          will of His Father.</p>
      <p>Jesus does not, after giving us general directions, leave us to guess the way amid bypaths and dangerous
          passes. He leads us in a straight path, and while we follow Him our footsteps will not slide.</p>
      <p>Each soul must live in hourly communion with Christ; for he says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” His
          principles are to be our principles; for these principles are the everlasting truth, proclaimed in
          righteousness, goodness, mercy, and love.</p>
      <p>His principles are the only steadfast things our world knows.</p>
