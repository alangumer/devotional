      <p><strong>Roads to Happiness That Are Never Closed</strong></p>
      <p>Godliness with contentment is great gain. 1 Timothy 6:6</p>
      <p>Too many cares and burdens are brought into our families, and too little of natural simplicity and peace and
          happiness is cherished. There should be less care for what the outside world will say and more thoughtful
          attention to the members of the family circle. There should be less display and affectation of worldly
          politeness, and much more tenderness and love, cheerfulness and Christian courtesy, among the members of the
          household. Many need to learn how to make home attractive, a place of enjoyment. Thankful hearts and kind
          looks are more valuable than wealth and luxury, and contentment with simple things will make home happy if
          love be there.</p>
      <p>Jesus, our Redeemer, walked the earth with the dignity of a king; yet He was meek and lowly of heart. He was a
          light and blessing in every home because He carried cheerfulness, hope, and courage with Him. Oh, that we
          could be satisﬁed with less heart longings, less striving for things difﬁcult to obtain wherewith to beautify
          our homes, while that which God values above jewels, the meek and quiet spirit, is not cherished. The grace of
          simplicity, meekness, and true affection would make a paradise of the humblest home. It is better to endure
          cheerfully every inconvenience than to part with peace and contentment.</p>
      <p>Here is the secret of content and peace and happiness.... The true Christian ...</p>
      <p>seeks to live a life of usefulness and conform his habits to the example of Jesus. Such a one will ﬁnd the
          truest happiness, the reward of <nobr>well-doing.</nobr> Such a one will be lifted above the slavery of an
          artiﬁcial life into the freedom and grace of Christlike simplicity.</p>
