      <p><strong>Prayer in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. John
          15:7</p>
      <p>The patriarchs were men of prayer, and God did great things for them. When Jacob left his father’s house for a
          strange land, he prayed in humble contrition, and in the night season the Lord answered him through vision....
          The Lord</p>
      <p>comforted the lonely wanderer with precious promises; and protecting angels were represented as stationed on
          each side of his path....</p>
      <p>Joseph prayed, and he was preserved from sin amid inﬂuences that were calculated to lead him away from God.
          When tempted to leave the path of purity and uprightness, he rejected the suggestion with, “How can I do this
          great wickedness, and sin against God?”</p>
      <p>Moses, who was much in prayer, was known as the meekest man on the face of the earth.... While he was leading
          the children of Israel through the wilderness,</p>
      <p>again and again it seemed that they must be exterminated on account of their murmuring and rebellion. But Moses
          went to the true Source of power; he laid the case before the Lord.... And the Lord said, “I have pardoned
          according to thy</p>
      <p>word.” ...</p>
      <p>Daniel was a man of prayer, and God gave him wisdom and ﬁrmness to resist every inﬂuence that conspired to draw
          him into the snare of intemperance. Even in his youth he was a moral giant in the strength of the Mighty
          One....</p>
      <p>In the prison at Philippi, while suffering from the cruel stripes they had received, their feet fast in the
          stocks, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praise to God; and angels were sent from heaven to deliver them. The
          earth shook under the tread of these heavenly messengers, and the prison doors ﬂew open, setting the prisoners
          free.</p>

      <p>Prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence, and gains us the victory.</p>
