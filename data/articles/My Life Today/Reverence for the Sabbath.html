      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Exodus 20:8</p>
      <p>“Remember” is placed at the very ﬁrst of the fourth commandment. Parents, you need to remember the Sabbath day
          yourselves to keep it holy. And if you do this, you are giving the proper instruction to your children; they
          will reverence God’s holy day.... All through the week keep the Lord’s holy Sabbath in view, for</p>
      <p>that day is to be devoted to the service of God. It is a day when the hands are to rest from worldly
          employment, when the soul’s needs are to receive especial attention.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>Sabbath–oh!</nobr> make it the sweetest, the most blessed day of the whole week.... Parents can and
          should give attention to their children, reading to</p>
      <p>them the most attractive portions of Bible history, educating them to reverence the Sabbath day, keeping it
          according to the commandment.... They can make</p>
      <p>the Sabbath a delight if they will take the proper course. The children can be interested in good reading or in
          conversation about the salvation of their souls.</p>
      <p>During a portion of the day all should have an opportunity to be out of doors....</p>
      <p>Let their young minds be associated with God in the beautiful scenery of nature, let their attention be called
          to the tokens of His love to man in His created works....</p>
      <p>As they view the beautiful things which He has created for the happiness of man, they will be led to regard Him
          as a tender, loving Father.... As the character of God</p>
      <p>puts on the aspect of love, benevolence, beauty, and attraction, they are drawn to love Him.</p>
      <p>The Sabbath is the golden clasp that unites God and His people. It means eternal salvation to keep the Sabbath
          holy unto the Lord.</p>
