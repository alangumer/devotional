    <h1>Love Not the World</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Living by Principle Not Inclination</strong></p>
      <p>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father
          is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the ﬂesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
          life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 1 John 2:15, 16</p>
      <p>The youth living in this age will have a stern battle to ﬁght if they make right principles their rule of
          action. It is the highest effort of a large class in society to do as others do, to shape their course
          according to the world’s standard. Like the empty bubble or the worthless weed, they drift with the current.
          They have no individuality, no moral independence. The approval of the world is of more value to them than the
          approval of God or the esteem of those whom He esteems. Their only motive or rule of action is policy. As they
          do not value truth or act from principle, no dependence can be placed upon them. They are the sport of Satan’s
          temptations. They have no true respect for themselves and no real happiness in life. This class are to be
          pitied for their weakness and folly, and their example should be shunned by all who desire to be truly worthy
          of respect. But instead of this, their society is too often courted, and they seem to exert a fascinating
          power, <nobr>well-nigh</nobr> impossible to break....</p>
      <p>In forming your opinions and choosing your associates let reason and the fear of God be your guide. Be ﬁrm in
          your purpose here, regardless of the opinions which others may entertain concerning you. When God’s
          requirements lead you to an opposite course from that which your associates are pursuing, go resolutely
          forward, whether you follow many or few. Whatever God’s Word condemns, that reject even though the whole world
          adopt and advocate it....</p>
      <p>Those who are drifting with the tide, who love pleasure and <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> and choose the easier
          way, regardless of principle so long as their desires are <nobr>gratiﬁed–these</nobr> will never stand with
          the overcomers around the great white throne.</p>
