      <p><strong>Highways to Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>Where there is no vision the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. Proverbs 29:18</p>
      <p>To those who love God it will be the highest delight to keep His commandments and to do those things that are
          pleasing in His sight....</p>
      <p>Says the psalmist, “The law of the Lord is perfect.” How wonderful in its simplicity, its comprehensiveness and
          perfection, is the law of Jehovah! It is so brief that we can easily commit every precept to memory, and yet
          so <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> as to express the whole will of God and to take cognizance, not only of the
          outward actions, but of the thoughts and intents, the desires and emotions, of the heart. Human laws cannot do
          this, They can deal with the outward actions only.... The</p>
      <p>law of God takes note of the jealousy, envy, hatred, malignity, revenge, lust, and ambition that surge through
          the soul, but have not found expression in the outward action; ... and these sinful emotions will be brought
          into account in the day when “God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be
          good, or whether it be evil.” ...</p>
      <p>There is no mystery in the law of God. All can comprehend the great truths which it embodies. The feeblest
          intellect can grasp these rules....</p>
      <p>Obedience to the law is essential, not only to our salvation, but to our own happiness and the happiness of all
          with whom we are connected.</p>
      <p>Man’s happiness must always be guarded by the law of God.... The law is</p>
      <p>the hedge which God has placed about His vineyard. By it those who obey are protected from evil.</p>
      <p>We owe to Him all that makes life desirable, and He asks of us the affections of the heart and the obedience of
          the life. His precepts, if obeyed, will bring happiness into the home life, happiness to every
          individual.</p>

      <p>Rightdoing will bring peace and holy joy.</p>
