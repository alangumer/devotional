      <p><strong>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. 2 Samuel 22:36</p>
      <p>You are to represent Christ in His meekness and gentleness and love. True gentleness is a gem of great value in
          the sight of God.</p>
      <p>We want a spirit of gentleness. We cannot live right in the family circle without it. In order to have the
          proper control of our children, we must manifest a spirit of gentleness and of meekness and of
          <nobr>long-suffering.</nobr> We do not want to have a faultﬁnding, fretful, scolding spirit. If we teach them
          to have a spirit of gentleness, we must have a spirit of gentleness ourselves; ... if we would have them
          manifest a spirit of love toward us, we must manifest a gentle, loving spirit toward them. But at the same
          time there need be no weakness or unwise indulgence on the part of parents. The mother must have ﬁrmness and
          decision. She must be as ﬁrm as a rock, and not swerve from the right. Her laws and rules should be carried
          out at all times and under all hazards, but she can do this with all gentleness and meekness.... The children
          will grow up <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> men and</p>
      <p>women.</p>
      <p>No member of the family can enclose himself within himself, where other members of the family shall not feel
          his inﬂuence and spirit. The very expression of the countenance has an inﬂuence for good or evil. His spirit,
          his words, his actions, his attitude toward others, are unmistakable.... If he is ﬁlled with the</p>
      <p>love of Christ, he will manifest courtesy, kindness, tender regard for the feelings of others, and will
          communicate to his associates, by his acts of love, a tender, grateful, happy feeling. It will be made
          manifest that he is living for Jesus.... He</p>
      <p>will be able to say to the Lord, “Thy gentleness hath made me great.”</p>
