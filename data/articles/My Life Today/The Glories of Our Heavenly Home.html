      <p><strong>Heavens Is a Real and Wonderful Place</strong></p>
      <p>And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the
          foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. Revelation 21:18,
          19</p>
      <p>The glorious city of God has twelve gates, set with pearls most glorious. It also has twelve foundations of
          various colors. The streets of the city are of pure gold. In this city is the throne of God, and a pure,
          beautiful river proceeding out of it, as clear as crystal. Its sparkling purity and beauty make glad the city
          of God. The saints will drink freely of the healing waters of the river of life....</p>
      <p>All faces will reﬂect the image of their Redeemer. There will then be no anxious, troubled countenances, but
          all will be bright, and smiling in spotless purity. The angels will be there, also the resurrected saints with
          the martyrs, and the best of all, and what will cause us the most joy, our lovely Saviour, who suffered and
          died that we might enjoy that happiness and freedom, will be <nobr>there.–His</nobr> glorious face will shine
          brighter than the sun, and light up the beautiful city and reﬂect glory all around.</p>
      <p>Children will be there. They will never be engaged in strife or discord. Their love will be fervent and holy.
          They will also have a crown of gold upon their heads and a harp in their hands. And their little countenances,
          that we here see so often troubled and perplexed, will beam with holy joy, expressive of their perfect freedom
          and happiness....</p>
      <p>The saints will have crowns of glory upon their heads and harps of gold in their hands. They will play upon the
          golden harp and sing redeeming love, and make melody unto God. Their former trials and suffering in this world
          will be forgotten and lost amid the glories of the New Earth. And they will ever have the approving smiles of
          Jesus upon them, and their happiness will be complete.... The</p>
      <p>future abode of the saints will be all glorious.</p>
