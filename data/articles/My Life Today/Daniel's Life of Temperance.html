    <h1>Daniel’s Life of Temperance</h1>

      <p><strong>Examples of Sanctiﬁed Lives</strong></p>
      <p>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not deﬁle himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with
          the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not deﬁle himself.
          Daniel 1:8</p>
      <p>The life of Daniel is an inspired illustration of what constitutes a sanctiﬁed character. It presents a lesson
          for all, and especially for the young. A strict compliance with the requirements of God is beneﬁcial to the
          health of body and mind. In order to reach the highest standard of moral and intellectual attainments, it is
          necessary to seek wisdom and strength from God and to observe strict temperance in all the habits of life. In
          the experience of Daniel and his companions we have an instance of the triumph of principle over temptation to
          indulge the appetite. It shows us that through religious principle young men may triumph over the lusts of the
          ﬂesh, and remain true to God’s requirements, even though it cost them a great sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>Daniel was a devoted servant of the Most High. His long life was ﬁlled with noble deeds of service for his
          Master. His purity of character and unwavering ﬁdelity are equaled only by his humility of heart and his
          contrition before God. We repeat, The life of Daniel is an inspired illustration of true sanctiﬁcation.</p>
      <p>Wherever they may be, those who are truly sanctiﬁed will elevate the moral standards by preserving correct
          physical habits and, like Daniel, presenting to others an example of temperance and
          <nobr>self-denial....</nobr></p>
      <p>With what care should Christians regulate their habits, that they may preserve the full vigor of every faculty
          to give to the service of Christ.</p>

      <p>He who cherishes the light which God has given him upon health reform has an important aid in the work of
          becoming sanctiﬁed through the truth and ﬁtted for immortality.</p>
