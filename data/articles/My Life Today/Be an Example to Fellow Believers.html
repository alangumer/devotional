      <p><strong>Exerting a Right Inﬂuence</strong></p>
      <p>Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 1
          Timothy 4:12</p>
      <p>By the atmosphere surrounding us, every person with whom we come in contact is consciously or unconsciously
          affected.... Our words, our acts, our</p>
      <p>dress, our deportment, even the expression of the countenance, has an inﬂuence....</p>
      <p>Every impulse thus imparted is seed sown which will produce its harvest. It is a link in the long chain of
          human events, extending we know not whither. If by our example we aid others in the development of good
          principles, we give them power to do good. In their turn they exert the same inﬂuence upon others, and they
          upon still others. Thus by our unconscious inﬂuence thousands may be blessed.</p>
      <p>Throw a pebble into the lake, and a wave is formed; and another and another; and as they increase, the circle
          widens, until it reaches the very shore. So with our inﬂuence. Beyond our knowledge or control it tells upon
          others in blessing or in cursing....</p>
      <p>And the wider the sphere of our inﬂuence the more good we may do. When those who profess to serve God follow
          Christ’s example, practicing the principles of the law in their daily life; when every act bears witness that
          they love God supremely and their neighbor as themselves, then will the church have power to move the
          world.</p>
      <p>If young men make their model an exalted one, having pure morals and ﬁrm principles, and if blended with this
          are affability and true Christian courtesy, there is a reﬁned perfection to the character which will win its
          way anywhere, and a powerful inﬂuence will be wielded in favor of virtue, temperance, and righteousness. Such
          characters will be of the highest value to society, more precious than gold. Their inﬂuence is for time and
          for eternity.</p>
