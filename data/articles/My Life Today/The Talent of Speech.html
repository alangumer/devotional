      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
          Colossians 4:6</p>
      <p>The voice is an entrusted talent, and it should be used to help and encourage and strengthen our fellowmen. If
          parents will love God and keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment, their language ... will be of a
          sound, pure, edifying character. Whether they are at home or abroad, their words will be well chosen.</p>
      <p>The very best school for voice culture is in the home life. Study in every way, not to annoy, but to cultivate
          a soft voice, distinct and plain.... Mothers should</p>
      <p>themselves act like Christ, speaking tender, loving words in the home.</p>
      <p>The right culture and use of the power of speech has to do with every line of Christian work; it enters into
          the home life and into all our intercourse with one another. We should accustom ourselves to speak in pleasant
          tones, to use pure and correct language, and words that are kind and courteous. Sweet, kind words are as dew
          and gentle showers to the soul. The Scripture says of Christ that grace was poured into His lips, that He
          might “know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.” And the Lord bids us, “Let your speech be
          alway with grace,” “that it may minister grace unto the hearers.” ... If we follow Christ’s example in doing
          good, hearts will open to us as they did to Him.</p>
      <p>Not abruptly, but with tact born of divine love, we can tell them of Him who is the “Chiefest among ten
          thousand,” and the One “altogether lovely.” This is the very highest work in which we can employ the talent of
          speech.</p>
      <p>Righteous words and deeds have a more powerful inﬂuence for good than all the sermons that can be
          preached.</p>
