      <p>Pure Religion Deﬁned</p>
      <p>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. Job 29:15</p>
      <p>Watch carefully, prayerfully, conscientiously, lest the mind become so engrossed with many important business
          transactions that true godliness is overlooked and love is quenched from the soul, notwithstanding the great
          and pitiful need of your being God’s helping hand to the blind and to all others who are unfortunate. The most
          friendless demand the most attention. Use your time and strength in learning to be “fervent in spirit,” to
          deal justly, and to love mercy, “serving the Lord.” Remember that Christ says, “Inasmuch as ye have done it
          unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.”</p>
      <p>God requires His people to be far more pitiful and considerate of the unfortunate than they are.... God
          requires that the same consideration which</p>
      <p>should be given to the widow and fatherless be given to the blind and to those suffering under the afﬂiction of
          other physical inﬁrmities. Disinterested benevolence is very rare in this age of the world.... It is strange
          that professed</p>
      <p>Christian men should disregard the plain, positive teachings of the Word of God and feel no compunction of
          conscience. God places upon them the responsibility of caring for the unfortunate, the blind, the lame, the
          widow, and the fatherless; but many make no effort to regard it.</p>
      <p>There is a great work to be done in our world, and as we approach the close of earth’s history, it does not
          lessen in the least degree; but when the perfect love of God is in the heart, wonderful things will be
          done.</p>
