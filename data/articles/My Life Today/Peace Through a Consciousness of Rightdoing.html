    <h1>Peace Through a Consciousness of Rightdoing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. Psalm 119:165</p>
      <p>If the mind is free and happy, from a consciousness of rightdoing and a sense of satisfaction in causing
          happiness to others, it creates a cheerfulness that will react upon the whole system, causing a freer
          circulation of the blood and a toning up of the entire body. The blessing of God is a healing power, and those
          who are abundant in beneﬁting others will realize that wondrous blessing in both heart and life.</p>
      <p>Those who follow the path of wisdom and holiness will not be troubled with vain regrets over misspent hours,
          neither will they be troubled with gloom or horror of mind, as some are, unless engaged in vain, triﬂing
          amusements....</p>
      <p>Amusements excite the mind, but depression is sure to follow. Useful labor and physical exercise will have a
          more healthful inﬂuence upon the mind and will strengthen the muscles, improve the circulation, and will prove
          a powerful agent in the recovery of health....</p>
      <p>The consciousness of rightdoing is the best medicine for diseased bodies and minds. The special blessing of God
          resting upon the receiver is health and strength.</p>
      <p>Doing good is a work that beneﬁts both giver and receiver. If you forget self in your interest for others, you
          gain a victory over your inﬁrmities. The satisfaction you will realize in doing good will greatly aid you in
          the recovery of the healthy tone of the imagination. The pleasure of doing good animates the mind and vibrates
          through the whole body.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>A person whose mind is quiet and satisﬁed in God is in the pathway to health.</p>
