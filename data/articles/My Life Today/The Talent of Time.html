      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
          Ephesians 5:15, 16</p>
      <p>God bestows talents upon men, not that these talents may lie unused or be employed in
          <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation,</nobr> but that they may be used to bless others. God grants men the gift of time for
          the purpose of promoting His glory. When this time is used in selﬁsh pleasure, the hours thus spent are lost
          for all eternity.</p>
      <p>Our time belongs to God. Every moment is His, and we are under the most solemn obligation to improve it to His
          glory. Of no talent He has given will He require a more strict account than of our time.</p>
      <p>The value of time is beyond computation. Christ regarded every moment as precious, and it is thus that we
          should regard it. Life is too short to be triﬂed away. We have but a few days of probation in which to prepare
          for eternity....</p>
      <p>The human family have scarcely begun to live when they begin to die, and the world’s incessant labor ends in
          nothingness unless a true knowledge in regard to eternal life is gained. The man who appreciates time as his
          working day will ﬁt himself for a mansion and for a life that is immortal. It is well that he was
          born....</p>
      <p>Life is too solemn to be absorbed in temporal and earthly matters, in a treadmill of care and anxiety for the
          things that are but an atom in comparison with the things of eternal interest. Yet God has called us to serve
          Him in the temporal affairs of life. Diligence in this work is as much a part of true religion as is devotion.
          The Bible gives no endorsement to idleness. It is the greatest curse that afﬂicts our world. Every man and
          woman who is truly converted will be a diligent worker.</p>
