    <h1>I Will Be Master of My Mind</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exercising <nobr>Self-control</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at
          the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:13 We have each of us an individual work to do, to gird up the loins
          of our minds, to be sober, to watch unto prayer. The mind must be ﬁrmly controlled to dwell</p>
      <p>upon subjects that will strengthen the moral powers.... The thoughts must be</p>
      <p>pure, the meditations of the heart must be clean, if the words of the mouth are to be words acceptable to
          Heaven and helpful to your associates.</p>
      <p>The mind should be guarded carefully. Nothing should be allowed to enter that will harm or destroy its healthy
          vigor. But to prevent this, it should be preoccupied with good seed, which, springing to life, will bring
          forth <nobr>fruit-bearing</nobr> branches.... A ﬁeld left uncultivated speedily produces a rank growth of
          thistles</p>
      <p>and tangled vines, which exhaust the soil and are worthless to the owner. The ground is full of seeds blown and
          carried by the wind from every quarter; and if it is left uncultivated, they spring up to life spontaneously,
          choking every precious <nobr>fruit-bearing</nobr> plant that is struggling for existence. If the ﬁeld were
          tilled and sown to grain, these valueless weeds would be extinguished, and could not ﬂourish.</p>
      <p>The youth who ﬁnds joy and happiness in reading the Word of God and in the hour of prayer is constantly
          refreshed by drafts from the Fountain of life. He will attain a height of moral excellence and a breadth of
          thought of which others cannot conceive. Communion with God encourages good thoughts, noble aspirations, clear
          perceptions of truth, and lofty purposes of action. Those who thus connect their souls with God are
          acknowledged by Him as His sons and daughters. They are constantly reaching higher and still higher, obtaining
          clear views of God and of eternity, until the Lord makes them channels of light and wisdom to the world.</p>
