      <p><strong>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all ﬂesh; and your sons and your
          daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. Joel 2:28,
          29</p>
      <p>We are living in the last days, in a time when we may expect much from the Lord. These words should bring us to
          the throne of grace to claim great things of Him. Here the promise is given that on the men and women and on
          our sons and daughters the Holy Spirit is to come; and “whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall
          be saved.” This brings to view a wonderful work to be done, for which we need the converting power of God in
          our hearts every day. It is our privilege to experience this. Heaven is full of blessings, and it is our
          privilege to claim the rich promises of God for our individual selves. We need to seek the Lord day and night
          that we may know just what steps to take and just what we ought to do.</p>
      <p>The Lord has a special work to do for us individually. As we see the wickedness of the world brought to light
          in the courts of justice and published in the daily papers, let us draw near to God, and by living faith lay
          hold of His promises, that the grace of Christ may be manifest in us. We may have an inﬂuence, a powerful
          inﬂuence, in the world. If the convicting power of God is in us, we shall be enabled to lead souls that are in
          sin to conversion.</p>
      <p>In the closing scenes of this earth’s history, many ... children and youth [who receive a true Christian
          education] will astonish people by their witness to the truth, which will be borne in simplicity, yet with
          spirit and power. They have been taught the fear of the Lord, and their hearts have been softened by a careful
          and prayerful study of the Bible. In the near future many children will be endued with the Spirit of God, and
          will do a work proclaiming the truth to the world....</p>
      <p>They will do a work in the world that not all the powers of evil can counteract.</p>
