      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. John
          14:6</p>
      <p>When Christ bowed on the banks of Jordan, after His baptism, the heavens were opened, and the Spirit descended
          in the form of a dove, like burnished gold, and encircled Him with its glory; and the voice of God from the
          highest heaven was heard, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” The prayer of Christ in
          man’s behalf opened the gates of heaven, and the Father had responded, accepting the petition for the fallen
          race. Jesus prayed as our substitute and surety, and now the human family may ﬁnd access to the Father through
          the merits of His <nobr>well-beloved</nobr> Son. This earth, because of transgression, had been struck off
          from the continent of heaven. Communication had ceased between man and his Maker; but the way has been opened
          so that he may return to the Father’s house. Jesus is “the way, the truth, and the life.” The gate of heaven
          has been left ajar, and the radiance from the throne of God shines into the hearts of those who love Him, even
          though they dwell in this <nobr>sin-cursed</nobr> earth. The light that encircled the divine Son of God will
          fall upon the pathway of all who follow in His footsteps. There is no reason for discouragement. The promises
          of God are sure and steadfast.</p>
      <p>“Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing; and I will
          receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”
          Do you desire to become the sons and daughters of the Most High? ... You may come unto the Father in the name
          of His Son, and, no matter how broken and feeble your petitions, Jesus will present them before the throne of
          inﬁnite power, and the light that was shed upon Him will be reﬂected upon you. You will be “accepted in the
          Beloved.”</p>
