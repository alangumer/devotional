    <h1>Clothed in the Robe of Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Perfection of Character</strong></p>
      <p>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in ﬁne linen, clean and white: for the ﬁne linen is the
          righteousness of saints. Revelation 19:8</p>
      <p>By the wedding garment ... is represented the pure, spotless character which Christ’s true followers will
          possess. To the church it is given “that she should be arrayed in ﬁne linen, clean and white,” “not having
          spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.” The ﬁne linen, says the Scripture, “is the righteousness of saints.” It
          is the righteousness of Christ, His own unblemished character, that through faith is imparted to all who
          receive Him as their personal Saviour....</p>
      <p>This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity
          wrought out a perfect character, and this character He offers to impart to us....</p>
      <p>When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the
          mind becomes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live His life. This is what
          it means to be clothed with the garment of His righteousness....</p>
      <p>Righteousness is rightdoing, and it is by their deeds that all will be judged. Our characters are revealed by
          what we do.</p>
      <p>Let the youth and the little children be taught to choose for themselves that royal robe woven in heaven’s
          <nobr>loom–the</nobr> “ﬁne linen, clean and white,” which all the holy ones of earth will wear. This robe,
          Christ’s own spotless character, is freely offered to every human being. But all who receive it will receive
          and wear it here.</p>
      <p>Clothed in the glorious apparel of Christ’s righteousness, they have a place at the King’s feast. They have a
          right to join the <nobr>blood-washed</nobr> throng.</p>
