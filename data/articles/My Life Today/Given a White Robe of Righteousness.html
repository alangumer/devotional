    <h1>Given a White Robe of Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ Redeems Me Unto Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the
          blood of the Lamb. Revelation 7:14</p>
      <p>Glorious will be the reward bestowed when the faithful workers gather about the throne of God and of the
          Lamb.... They will stand before the throne, accepted</p>
      <p>in the Beloved. All their sins have been blotted out, all their transgressions borne away. Now they can look
          upon the undimmed glory of the throne of God.... In</p>
      <p>that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and the Son. The angels, touching their
          golden harps, will welcome the King and His trophies of <nobr>victory–those</nobr> who have been washed and
          made white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
      <p>All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise and <nobr>thanksgiving–the</nobr> robe
          of Christ’s righteousness. All nature in its surpassing loveliness will offer to God a constant tribute of
          praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven. The years will move on in gladness. The
          light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater than it
          is now. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God
          and Christ will unite in proclaiming, “There shall be no more sin, neither shall there be any more
          death.”</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>The conﬂict is over. All tribulation and strife are at an end. Songs of victory ﬁll all heaven as the redeemed
          stand around the throne of God. All take up the joyful strain, “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and
          lives again, a triumphant conqueror.”</p>
      <p>“I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
          tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and
          cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.”</p>
