    <h1>Choose the Way of Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Living by Principle Not Inclination</strong></p>
      <p>I have chosen the way of truth; thy judgments have I laid before me. I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O Lord,
          put me not to shame. Psalm 119:30, 31</p>
      <p>There are two great principles, one of loyalty, the other of disloyalty. We all need greater Christian courage,
          that we may uplift the standard on which is inscribed the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.... The
          line of</p>
      <p>demarcation between the obedient and the disobedient must be plain and distinct. We must have a ﬁrm
          determination to do the Lord’s will at all times and in all places....</p>
      <p>Christian strength is obtained by serving the Lord faithfully. Young men and young women should realize that to
          be one with Christ is the highest honor to which they can attain. By the strictest ﬁdelity they should strive
          for moral independence, and this independence they should maintain against every inﬂuence that may try to turn
          them from righteous principles. Stronger minds may, yes, they will, make assertions that have no foundation in
          truth. Let the heavenly eyesalve be applied to the eyes of your understanding, that you may distinguish
          between truth and error. Search the Word; and when you ﬁnd a “Thus saith the Lord,” take your stand....</p>
      <p>In Pilgrim’s Progress there is a character called Pliable. Youth, shun this character. Those represented by it
          are very accommodating, but they are as a reed shaken by the wind. They possess no will power. Every youth
          needs to cultivate decision. A divided state of the will is a snare, and will be the ruin of many youth. Be
          ﬁrm, else you will be left with your house, or character, built upon a sandy foundation.</p>
      <p>The Lord’s philosophy is the rule of the Christian’s life. The entire being should be imbued with the
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> principles of heaven. The busy nothings which consume the time of so many shrink into
          their proper position before a healthy, sanctifying Bible piety.</p>
