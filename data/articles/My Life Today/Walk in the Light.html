      <p><strong>Victory in the Conﬂict</strong></p>
      <p>O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy
          tabernacles. Psalm 43:3</p>
      <p>In these days of peril we should be exceedingly careful not to reject the rays of light which Heaven in mercy
          sends us, for it is by these that we are to discern the devices of the enemy. We need light from Heaven every
          hour, that we may distinguish between the sacred and the common, the eternal and the temporal. If left to
          ourselves, we shall blunder at every step; we shall incline to the world, we shall shun
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and see no necessity for constant watchfulness and prayer, and we shall be taken
          captive by Satan at his will. Some are today in this position. Having refused the light which God has sent
          them, they know not at what they stumble.</p>
      <p>All whose names shall at last be found written in the Lamb’s book of life will ﬁght manfully the battles of the
          Lord. They will labor most earnestly to discern and put away temptations and every evil thing. They will feel
          that the eye of God is upon them and that the strictest ﬁdelity is required. As faithful sentinels they will
          keep the passage barred, that Satan may not pass them disguised as an angel of light to work his work of death
          in their midst....</p>
      <p>The <nobr>white-robed</nobr> ones who surround the throne of God are not composed of that company who were
          lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, and who choose to drift with the current rather than to breast
          the waves of opposition. All who remain pure and uncorrupted from the spirit and inﬂuence prevailing at this
          time will have stern conﬂicts. They will come through great tribulation; they will wash their robes of
          character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. These will sing the song of triumph in the kingdom of
          glory.</p>
