      <p><strong>Examples of Sanctiﬁed Lives</strong></p>
      <p>The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 1 John
          2:17</p>
      <p>John and his fellow disciples were in a school in which Christ was teacher....</p>
      <p>John treasured every lesson and constantly sought to bring his life into harmony with the Divine Pattern. The
          lessons of Jesus, setting forth meekness, humility, and love as essential to growth in grace and a ﬁtness for
          his work, were of the highest value to John....</p>
      <p>An instructive lesson may be drawn from the striking contrast between the character of John and that of Judas.
          John was a living illustration of sanctiﬁcation. On the other hand, Judas possessed a form of godliness, while
          his character was more satanic than divine. He professed to be a disciple of Christ, but in words and in works
          denied Him.</p>
      <p>Judas had the same precious opportunities as had John to study and to imitate the Pattern. He listened to the
          lessons of Christ, and his character might have been transformed by divine grace. But while John was earnestly
          warring against his own faults and seeking to assimilate to Christ, Judas was violating his conscience,
          yielding to temptation, and fastening upon himself habits of dishonesty that would transform him into the
          image of Satan.</p>
      <p>These two disciples represent the Christian world. All profess to be Christ’s followers; but while one class
          walk in humility and meekness, learning of Jesus, the other show that they are not doers of the Word, but
          hearers only. One class are sanctiﬁed through the truth; the other know nothing of the transforming power of
          divine grace. The former are daily dying to self, and are overcoming sin. The latter are indulging their own
          lusts, and becoming the servants of Satan.</p>
