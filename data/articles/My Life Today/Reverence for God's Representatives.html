      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he
          had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place: but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised
          his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no
          remedy. 2 Chronicles 36:15, 16</p>
      <p>Reverence should be shown for God’s <nobr>representatives–for</nobr> ministers, teachers, and parents who are
          called to speak and act in His stead. In the respect shown to them He is honored.</p>
      <p>The education and training of the youth should be of a character that would exalt sacred things and encourage
          pure devotion for God in His house. Many who profess to be children of the heavenly King have no true
          appreciation of the sacredness of eternal things....</p>
      <p>They are seldom instructed that the minister is God’s ambassador, that the message he brings is one of God’s
          appointed agencies in the salvation of souls, and that to all who have the privilege brought within their
          reach it will be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death....</p>
      <p>Many ... make the service a subject of criticism at home, approving a few things and condemning others.... In
          regard to the service of the sanctuary, if the</p>
      <p>speaker has a blemish, be afraid to mention it. Talk only of the good work he is doing, of the good ideas he
          presented, which you should heed as coming through God’s agent....</p>
      <p>Unless correct ideas of true worship and true reverence are impressed upon the people, there will be a growing
          tendency to place the sacred and eternal on a level with common things, and those professing the truth will be
          an offense to God and a disgrace to religion. They can never, with their uncultivated ideas, appreciate a pure
          and holy heaven, and be prepared to join with the worshipers in the heavenly courts above, where all is purity
          and perfection, where every being has perfect reverence for God and His holiness.</p>
      <p>Paul describes the work of God’s ambassadors as that by which every man shall be presented perfect in Christ
          Jesus.</p>
