    <h1>Enoch’s Life of Holiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Examples of Sanctiﬁed Lives</strong></p>
      <p>Enoch walked with God ... three hundred years. Genesis 5:22</p>
      <p>There was a line of holy men who, elevated and ennobled by communion with God, lived as in the companionship of
          Heaven. They were men of massive intellect, of wonderful attainments. They had a great and holy
          <nobr>mission–to</nobr> develop a character of righteousness, to teach a lesson of godliness, not only to the
          men of their time, but for future generations....</p>
      <p>Of Enoch it is written that he lived <nobr>sixty-ﬁve</nobr> years, and begat a son. After that he walked with
          God three hundred years. During these earlier years Enoch had loved and feared God and had kept His
          commandments.... From the lips of</p>
      <p>Adam he had learned the dark story of the fall and the cheering one of God’s grace as seen in the promise, and
          he relied upon the Redeemer to come. But after the birth of his ﬁrst son Enoch reached a higher experience; he
          was drawn into a closer relationship with God. He realized more fully his own obligations and responsibility
          as a son of God. And as he saw the child’s love for its father, its simple trust in his protection; as he felt
          the deep, yearning tenderness of his own heart for that <nobr>ﬁrst-born</nobr> son, he learned a precious
          lesson of the wonderful love of God to men in the gift of His Son and the conﬁdence which the children of God
          may repose in their heavenly Father. The inﬁnite, unfathomable love of God through Christ became the subject
          of his meditations day and night, and with all the fervor of his soul he sought to reveal that love to the
          people among whom he dwelt.</p>
      <p>Enoch’s walk with God was not in a trance or a vision, but in all the duties of his daily life.... In the
          family and in his intercourse with men, as a husband and</p>
      <p>father, a friend, a citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering servant of the Lord.</p>
