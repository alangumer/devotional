      <p><strong>Enduring Trials</strong></p>
      <p>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a reﬁner’s ﬁre,
          and like fullers’ soap: and he shall sit as a reﬁner and puriﬁer of silver: and he shall purify the sons of
          Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.
          Malachi 3:2, 3</p>
      <p>A reﬁning, purifying process is going on among the people of God, and the Lord of hosts has set His hand to
          this work. This process is most trying to the soul, but it is necessary in order that deﬁlement may be
          removed. Trials are essential in order that we may be brought close to our heavenly Father, in submission to
          His will, that we may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.... The Lord</p>
      <p>brings His children over the same ground again and again, increasing the pressure until perfect humility ﬁlls
          the mind, and the character is transformed; then they are victorious over self, and in harmony with Christ and
          the Spirit of heaven. The puriﬁcation of God’s people cannot be accomplished without suffering.... He</p>
      <p>passes us from one ﬁre to another, testing our true worth. True grace is willing to be tried. If we are loath
          to be searched by the Lord, our condition is one of peril....</p>
      <p>It is in mercy that the Lord reveals to men their hidden defects. He would have them critically examine the
          complicated emotions and motives of their own hearts, and detect that which is wrong, and modify their
          dispositions and reﬁne their manners. God would have His servants become acquainted with their own hearts. In
          order to bring to them a true knowledge of their condition, He permits the ﬁre of afﬂiction to assail them, so
          that they may be puriﬁed. The trials of life are God’s workmen to remove the impurities, inﬁrmities, and
          roughness from our characters, and ﬁt them for the society of pure, heavenly angels in glory.... The</p>
      <p>ﬁre will not consume us, but only remove the dross, and we shall come forth seven times puriﬁed, bearing the
          impress of the Divine.</p>
