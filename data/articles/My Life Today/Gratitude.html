      <p><strong>Roads to Happiness That Are Never Closed</strong></p>
      <p>I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. Psalm 13:6</p>
      <p>Every earthly wish may be gratiﬁed, and yet men pass on as did the ungrateful lepers who had been cleansed and
          healed of their obnoxious disease. These lepers had been restored to health by Christ, and the parts that had
          been destroyed by the disease were <nobr>re-created;</nobr> but only one, on ﬁnding himself made whole,
          returned to give God glory....</p>
      <p>The lesson which is recorded concerning the ten lepers should awaken in every heart a most earnest desire to
          change the existing order of ingratitude into one of praise and thanksgiving. Let the professed people of God
          stop murmuring and complaining. Let us remember who is the ﬁrst great Giver of all our blessings. We are fed
          and clothed and sustained in life, and should we not educate ourselves and our children to respond with
          gratitude to our heavenly Father?</p>
      <p>Have we not reason to talk of God’s goodness and to tell of His power? When friends are kind to us we esteem it
          a privilege to thank them for their kindness. How much more should we count it a joy to return thanks to the
          Friend who has given us every good and perfect gift. Then let us, in every church, cultivate thanksgiving to
          God. Let us educate our lips to praise God in the family circle....</p>
      <p>Let our gifts and offerings declare our gratitude for the favors we daily receive. In everything we should show
          forth the joy of the Lord and make known the message of God’s saving grace.</p>
      <p>The hearts of those who reveal the attributes of Christ glow with divine love. They are imbued with the spirit
          of gratitude.... Lift up Jesus. Lift Him up, the</p>
      <p>man of Calvary, with the voice of song and prayer. Seek earnestly to spread the gospel. Tell the precious story
          of God’s love for man. In this work you will ﬁnd a satisfaction that will last through the eternal ages.</p>
