      <p><strong>Heroes for God</strong></p>
      <p>At my ﬁrst answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me....</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and
          that all the Gentiles might hear. 2 Timothy 4:16, 17</p>
      <p>Paul before <nobr>Nero–how</nobr> striking the contrast! ... In power and greatness Nero stood unrivaled....
          Without money, without friends, without counsel, Paul had</p>
      <p>been brought forth from a dungeon to be tried for his life....</p>
      <p>The countenance of the monarch bearing the shameful record of the passions that raged within; the countenance
          of the prisoner telling the story of a heart at peace with God and man. The results of opposite systems of
          education stood that day <nobr>contrasted–a</nobr> life of unbounded <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> and a life
          of entire <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> Here were the representatives of two theories of
          <nobr>life–all-absorbing</nobr> selﬁshness, which counts nothing too valuable to be sacriﬁced for momentary
          gratiﬁcation, and <nobr>self-denying</nobr> endurance, ready to give up life itself, if need be, for the good
          of others....</p>
      <p>The people and the judges ... had been present at many trials, and had looked upon many a criminal; but never
          had they seen a man wear a look of such holy calmness.... His words struck a chord that vibrated in the hearts
          even of the most</p>
      <p>hardened. Truth, clear and convincing, overthrew error. Light shone into the minds of many who afterward gladly
          followed its rays.... He pointed his hearers</p>
      <p>to the sacriﬁce made for the fallen race....</p>
      <p>Thus pleads the advocate of truth; faithful among the faithless, loyal among the disloyal, he stands as God’s
          representative, and his voice is as a voice from heaven. There is no fear, no sadness, no discouragement, in
          word or look.... His</p>
      <p>words are as a shout of victory above the roar of battle.</p>
      <p>Let this hero of faith speak for himself. He says, “I take pleasure in inﬁrmities, in reproaches, in
          necessities, in persecution, in distresses for Christ’s sake.”</p>
