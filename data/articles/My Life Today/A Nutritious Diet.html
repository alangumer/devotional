      <p><strong>Keeping Physically Fit</strong></p>
      <p>Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisﬁeth not? hearken
          diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Isaiah
          55:2</p>
      <p>Health reform is an intelligent selection of the most healthful article of food prepared in the most healthful,
          simplest form.</p>
      <p>Our bodies are built up from the food we eat. There is a constant breaking down of the tissues of the body;
          every movement of every organ involves waste, and this waste is repaired from our food. Each organ of the body
          requires its share of nutrition. The brain must be supplied with its portion; the bones, muscles, and nerves
          demand theirs. It is a wonderful process that transforms the food into blood and uses this blood to build up
          the varied parts of the body; but this process is going on continually, supplying with life and strength each
          nerve, muscle, and tissue.</p>
      <p>God has furnished man with abundant means for the gratiﬁcation of an unperverted appetite. He has spread before
          him the products of the <nobr>earth–a</nobr> bountiful variety of food that is palatable to the taste and
          nutritious to the system. Of these our benevolent heavenly Father says we may freely eat. Fruits, grains, and
          vegetables, prepared in a simple way, free from spice and grease of all kinds, make, with milk or cream, the
          most healthful diet. They impart nourishment to the body and give a power of endurance and a vigor of
          intellect that are not produced by a stimulating diet.</p>
      <p>Let the table be made inviting and attractive, as it is supplied with the good things which God has so
          bountifully bestowed. Let mealtime be a cheerful, happy time. As we enjoy the gifts of God, let us respond by
          grateful praise to the Giver.</p>
      <p>God has given us the fruits and grains of the earth for food, that we might have unfevered blood, calm nerves,
          and clear minds.</p>
