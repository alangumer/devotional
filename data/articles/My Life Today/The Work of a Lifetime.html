      <p><strong>Perfection of Character</strong></p>
      <p>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all ﬁlthiness of the ﬂesh and
          spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. 2 Corinthians 7:1</p>
      <p>The formation of a right character is the work of a lifetime, and is the outgrowth of prayerful meditation
          united with a grand purpose. The excellence of character that you possess must be the result of your own
          effort. Friends may encourage you, but they cannot do the work for you. Wishing, sighing, dreaming, will never
          make you great or good. You must climb.</p>
      <p>The conversation we have by the ﬁreside, the books we read, the business we transact, are all agents in forming
          our characters, and day by day decide our eternal destiny.</p>
      <p>Mental ability and genius are not character, for these are often possessed by those who have the very opposite
          of a good character. Reputation is not character. True character is a quality of the soul, revealing itself in
          the conduct.</p>
      <p>A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we can take from this world to
          the next. Those who are under the instruction of Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with
          them to the heavenly mansions. And in heaven we are continually to improve.</p>
      <p>A good character is a capital of more value than gold or silver. It is unaffected by panics or failures, and in
          that day when earthly possessions shall be swept away, it will bring rich returns. Integrity, ﬁrmness, and
          perseverance are qualities that all should seek earnestly to cultivate; for they clothe the possessor with a
          power which is <nobr>irresistible–a</nobr> power which makes him strong to do good, strong to resist evil,
          strong to bear adversity.</p>
