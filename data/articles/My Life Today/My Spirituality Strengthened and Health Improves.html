      <p>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy
          righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward. Isaiah 58:8</p>
      <p>Is not this what we all crave? Oh, there is health and peace in doing the will of our Heavenly Father. “Thy
          righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward. Then shalt thou call, and the
          Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the
          yoke, the putting forth of the ﬁnger, and speaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and
          satisfy the afﬂicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday; and the
          Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be
          like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.”</p>
      <p>If thou clothe the naked, and bring the poor ... to thy house, and deal thy bread to the hungry, “then shall
          thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily.” Doing good is an
          excellent remedy for disease.</p>
      <p>The pleasure of doing good to others imparts a glow to the feelings which ﬂashes through the nerves, quickens
          the circulation of the blood, and induces mental and physical health.</p>
      <p>Pure and undeﬁled religion is not a sentiment, but the doing of works of mercy and love. This religion is
          necessary to health and happiness. It enters the polluted soul temple, and with a scourge drives out the
          sinful intruders. Taking the throne, it consecrates all by its presence, illuminating the heart....It opens
          the windows</p>
      <p>of the soul heavenward, letting in the sunshine of God’s love. With it comes serenity and composure. Physical,
          mental, and moral strength increase, because the atmosphere of heaven, as a living, active agency, ﬁlls the
          soul.</p>
