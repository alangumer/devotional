      <p>And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. Isaiah
          54:13</p>
      <p>Your home is a little world of itself.... You are the ones who must decide</p>
      <p>whether your children shall choose the service of God or the service of mammon, eternal life or eternal
          death....</p>
      <p>Like the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God should erect an altar to Him wherever they pitch
          their tent.... Let the father, as priest of the household,</p>
      <p>lay upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacriﬁce, while the wife and children unite in prayer and
          praise. In such a household Jesus will love to abide.</p>
      <p>From every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love should be revealed in every act. It should ﬂow
          out in all home intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselﬁsh courtesy. There are
          homes where this principle is carried <nobr>out–homes</nobr> where God is worshiped and truest love reigns.
          From these homes morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense, and His mercies and blessings
          descend upon the suppliants like morning dew.</p>
      <p>Let us raise our eyes to the open door of the sanctuary above, where the light of the glory of God shines in
          the face of Christ, who “is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him.” ...</p>
      <p>The soul may ascend nearer heaven on the wings of praise. God is worshiped with song and music in the courts
          above, and as we express our gratitude, we are approximating to the worship of the heavenly hosts. “Whoso
          offereth praise gloriﬁeth” God. Let us with reverent joy come before our Creator, with “thanksgiving, and the
          voice of melody.”</p>
