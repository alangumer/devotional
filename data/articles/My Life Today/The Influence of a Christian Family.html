    <h1>The Inﬂuence of a Christian Family</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exerting a Right Inﬂuence</strong></p>
      <p>For I know him, that he will command his children, and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of
          the Lord, to do justice and judgment. Genesis 18:19</p>
      <p>Every Christian family should illustrate to the world the power and excellence of Christian inﬂuences.</p>
      <p>The home in which the members are kindly, courteous Christians exerts a <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> inﬂuence for
          good. Other families mark the results attained by such a home and follow the example set, in their turn
          guarding their homes against evil inﬂuences. Angels of heaven often visit the home in which the will of God
          bears sway. Under the power of divine grace such a home becomes a place of refreshing to worn, weary pilgrims.
          Self is kept from asserting itself. Right habits are formed. There is a careful recognition of the rights of
          others. The faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul stands at the helm, presiding over the entire
          household.</p>
      <p>One <nobr>well-ordered,</nobr><nobr>well-disciplined</nobr> family tells more in behalf of Christianity than
          all the sermons that can be preached.</p>
      <p>A lamp, however small, if kept steadily burning, may be the means of lighting many other lamps. Our sphere of
          inﬂuence may seem narrow, our ability small, our opportunities few, our acquirements limited; yet wonderful
          possibilities are ours through a faithful use of the opportunities of our own homes. If we will open our
          hearts and home to the divine principles of life, we shall become channels for currents of
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power. From our homes will ﬂow streams of healing, bringing life, and beauty, and
          fruitfulness.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of a carefully guarded Christian home in the years of childhood and youth is the surest safeguard
          against the corruptions of the world.</p>
