    <h1>Principle Not to Be Sacriﬁced for Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Living by Principle Not Inclination</strong></p>
      <p>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart
          be troubled, neither let it be afraid. John 14:27</p>
      <p>There always have been and always will be two classes on the earth to the end of <nobr>time–the</nobr>
          believers in Jesus, and those who reject Him. Sinners, however wicked, abominable, and corrupt, by faith in
          Him will be puriﬁed, made clean, through the doing of His word.... Those who reject Christ and refuse to</p>
      <p>believe the truth will be ﬁlled with bitterness against those who accept Jesus as a personal Saviour. But those
          who receive Christ are melted and subdued by the manifestation of His love and His humiliation, suffering, and
          death in their behalf....</p>
      <p>The peace that Christ gave to His disciples, and for which we pray, is the peace that is born of truth, a peace
          that is not to be quenched because of division. Without may be wars and ﬁghtings, jealousies, envies, hatred,
          strife; but the peace of Christ is not that which the world giveth or taketh away. It could endure amid the
          hunting of spies and the ﬁercest opposition of His enemies.... Christ did not</p>
      <p>for an instant seek to purchase peace by a betrayal of sacred trusts. Peace could not be made by a compromise
          of principles.... It is a grave mistake on the part of</p>
      <p>those who are children of God to seek to bridge the gulf that separates the children of light from the children
          of darkness by yielding principle, by compromising the truth. It would be surrendering the peace of Christ in
          order to make peace or fraternize with the world. The sacriﬁce is too costly to be made by the children of God
          to make peace with the world by giving up the principles of truth.... Then</p>
      <p>let the followers of Christ settle it in their minds that they will never compromise truth, never yield one
          iota of principle for the favor of the world. Let them hold to the peace of Christ.</p>
