    <h1>Who is My Neighbor?</h1>

      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>But he ... said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? Luke 10:29 Among the Jews the question, “Who is my
          neighbor?” caused endless dispute.</p>
      <p>They had no doubt as to the heathen and the Samaritans. These were strangers and enemies. But where should the
          distinction be made among the people of their own nation, and among the different classes of society? ... This
          question Christ answered in the parable of the good Samaritan. He showed that our neighbor does not mean
          merely one of the church or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to race, color, or class
          distinction. Our neighbor is every person who needs our help. Our neighbor is every soul who is wounded and
          bruised by the adversary. Our neighbor is every one who is the property of God.</p>
      <p>Every one who is in suffering need is our neighbor. Every straying son and daughter of Adam, who has been
          ensnared by the enemy of souls and bound in the slavery of wrong habits that blight the <nobr>God-given</nobr>
          manhood or womanhood, is my neighbor.</p>
      <p>Our neighbors are not merely our associates and special friends; they are not simply those who belong to our
          church, or who think as we do. Our neighbors are the whole human family. We are to do good to all men, and
          especially to those who are of the household of faith. We are to give to the world an exhibition of what it
          means to carry out the law of God. We are to love God supremely and our neighbor as ourselves.</p>
      <p>Today God gives men opportunity to show whether they love their neighbor. He who truly loves God and his fellow
          man is he who shows mercy to the destitute, the suffering, the wounded, those who are ready to die. God calls
          upon every man to take up his neglected work, to seek to restore the moral image of the Creator in
          humanity.</p>
