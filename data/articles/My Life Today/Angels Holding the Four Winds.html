      <p><strong>Angel Guidance in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice
          to the four angels, ... saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the
          servants of our God in their foreheads. Revelation 7:2, 3</p>
      <p>Four mighty angels are still holding the four winds of the earth. Terrible destruction is forbidden to come in
          full. The accidents by land and by sea; the loss of life, steadily increasing, by storm, by tempest, by
          railroad disaster, by conﬂagration; the terrible ﬂoods, the earthquakes, and the winds will be the stirring up
          of the nations to one deadly combat, while the angels hold the four winds, forbidding the terrible power of
          Satan to be exercised in its fury until the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads.</p>
      <p>Angels are holding the four winds, which are represented as an angry horse seeking to break loose and rush over
          the face of the whole earth, bearing destruction and death in its path.</p>
      <p>A terrible conﬂict is before us. We are nearing the battle of the great day of God Almighty. That which has
          been held in control is to be let loose. The angel of mercy is folding her wings, preparing to step down from
          the throne and leave the world to the control of Satan. The principalities and powers of earth are in bitter
          revolt against the God of heaven. They are ﬁlled with hatred against those who serve Him, and soon, very soon,
          will be fought the last great battle between good and evil. The earth is to be the <nobr>battleﬁeld–the</nobr>
          scene of the ﬁnal contest and the ﬁnal victory.</p>
      <p>While their hands were loosening, and the four winds were about to blow, the merciful eye of Jesus gazed on the
          remnant that were not sealed, and He raised His hands to the Father and pleaded with Him that He had spilled
          His blood for them. Then another angel was commissioned to ﬂy swiftly to the four angels and bid them hold
          until the servants of God were sealed with the seal of the living God in their foreheads.</p>
