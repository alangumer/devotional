      <p><strong>The Ladder of Christian Progress</strong></p>
      <p>Christian Growth</p>
      <p>Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to
          temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
          charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor
          unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Peter <nobr>1:5-8</nobr></p>
      <p>These words are full of instruction, and strike the keynote of victory. The apostle presents before the
          believers the ladder of Christian progress, every step of which represents advancement in the knowledge of
          God, and in the climbing of which there is to be no standstill. Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
          patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity are the rounds of the ladder. We are saved by climbing
          round after round, mounting step after step, to the height of Christ’s ideal for us. Thus He is made unto us
          wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctiﬁcation, and redemption.</p>
      <p>All these successive steps are not to be kept before the mind’s eye, and counted as you start; but ﬁxing the
          eye upon Jesus, with an eye single to the glory of God, you will make advancement....</p>
      <p>By taking one step after another, the highest ascent may be climbed, and the summit of the mount may be reached
          at last. Do not become overwhelmed with the great amount of work you must do in your lifetime, for you are not
          required to do it all at once. Let every power of your being go to each day’s work, improve each precious
          opportunity, appreciate the helps that God gives you, and make advancement up the ladder of progress step by
          step. Remember that you are to live but one day at a time, that God has given you one day, and heavenly
          records will show how you have valued its privileges and opportunities. May you so improve every day given you
          of God that at last you may hear the Master say, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”</p>
