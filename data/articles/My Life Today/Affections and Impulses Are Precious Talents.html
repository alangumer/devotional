      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another. Romans 12:10</p>
      <p>Kindly affections, generous impulses, and a quick apprehension of spiritual things are precious talents and lay
          their possessor under a weighty responsibility. All are to be used in God’s service. But here many err.
          Satisﬁed with the possession of these qualities, they fail to bring them into active service for others....
          Those who possess large affections are under obligation to God to</p>
      <p>bestow them, not merely on their friends, but on all who need their help. Social advantages are talents, and
          are to be used for the beneﬁt of all within reach of our inﬂuence....</p>
      <p>Talents used are talents multiplied. Success is not the result of chance or of destiny; it is the outworking of
          God’s own providence, the reward of faith and discretion, of virtue and persevering effort. The Lord desires
          us to use every gift we have; and if we do this, we shall have greater gifts to use. He does not
          supernaturally endow us with the qualiﬁcations we lack; but while we use that which we have, He will work with
          us to increase and strengthen every faculty. By every wholehearted, earnest sacriﬁce for the Master’s service,
          our powers will increase.... As we cherish and obey the promptings of the Spirit, our hearts are</p>
      <p>enlarged to receive more and more of His power and to do more and better work. Dormant energies are aroused and
          palsied faculties receive new life....</p>
      <p>As we seek to win others to Christ, bearing the burdens of souls in our prayers, our own hearts will throb with
          the quickening inﬂuence of God’s grace; our own affections will glow with more divine fervor; our whole
          Christian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.</p>
