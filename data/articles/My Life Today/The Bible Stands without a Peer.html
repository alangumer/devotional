      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. Jeremiah
          33:3</p>
      <p>No other study will so ennoble every thought, feeling, and aspiration as the study of the Scriptures. No other
          book can satisfy the questionings of the mind and the craving of the heart. By obtaining a knowledge of God’s
          Word, and giving heed thereto, men may rise from the lowest depths of ignorance and degradation to become the
          sons of God, the associates of sinless angels....</p>
      <p>As an educating power, the Bible is without a rival. Nothing will so impart vigor to all the faculties as an
          effort to grasp the stupendous truths of revelation. The mind gradually adapts itself to the subjects upon
          which it is allowed to dwell. If occupied with commonplace matters only, it will become dwarfed and
          enfeebled....</p>
      <p>In its wide range of style and subjects the Bible has something to interest every mind and appeal to every
          heart.... In it the most simply stated truths are</p>
      <p><nobr>involved–principles</nobr> that are as high as heaven and that encompass eternity. There is no position
          in life, no phase of human experience, for which the Bible</p>
      <p>does not contain valuable instruction. Ruler and subject, master and servant, buyer and seller, borrower and
          lender, parent and child, teacher and <nobr>student–all</nobr> may here ﬁnd lessons of priceless worth.</p>
      <p>But above all else, the Word of God sets forth the plan of salvation: shows how sinful man may be reconciled to
          God, lays down the great principles of truth and duty which should govern our lives, and promises us divine
          aid in their observance. It reaches beyond this ﬂeeting life, beyond the brief and troubled history of our
          race. It opens to our view the long vista of eternal <nobr>ages–ages</nobr> undarkened by sin, undimmed by
          sorrow.</p>
