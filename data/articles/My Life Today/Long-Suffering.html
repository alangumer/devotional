      <p><strong>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with
          joyfulness. Colossians 1:11</p>
      <p>Love is the law of Christ’s kingdom. The Lord calls upon every one to reach a high standard. The lives of His
          people are to reveal love, meekness, <nobr>long-suffering.</nobr><nobr>Long-suffering</nobr> bears something,
          yea, many things, without seeking to be avenged by word or act.</p>
      <p><nobr>“Long-suffering”</nobr> is patience with offence; long endurance. If you are <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr>
          you will not impart to others your supposed knowledge of your brother’s mistakes and errors. You will seek to
          help and save him, because he has been purchased with the blood of Christ. “Tell him his fault between thee
          and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.” “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a
          fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou
          also be tempted.” To be <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> is not to be gloomy and sad, sour and hardhearted; it is
          to be exactly the opposite.</p>
      <p>Try to live peaceably with all men, and let the atmosphere surrounding your soul be sweet and fragrant. The
          Lord hears every unwise word that is spoken. If you will battle against selﬁsh human nature, you will go
          forward steadily in the work of overcoming hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong. By patience,
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> and forbearance you will accomplish much. Remember that you cannot be humiliated
          by the unwise speeches of someone else, but that when you answer unwisely, you lose a victory that you might
          have gained. Be very careful of your words.</p>
      <p>Forbearance and unselﬁshness mark the words and deeds of those who are born again to live the new life in
          Christ.</p>
