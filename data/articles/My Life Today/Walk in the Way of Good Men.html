      <p><strong>Recreation and Amusements</strong></p>
      <p>Walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. Proverbs 2:20</p>
      <p>There are modes of recreation which are highly beneﬁcial to both mind and body. An enlightened, discriminating
          mind will ﬁnd abundant means for entertainment and diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive.
          Recreation in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature, will be of the highest
          beneﬁt.</p>
      <p>While we are seeking to refresh our spirits and invigorate our bodies, we are required of God to use all our
          powers at all times to the best purpose. We may associate together as we do here today, [From an address given
          at an outdoor recreational gathering at Goguac Lake, Michigan.] and do all to the glory of God. We can and
          should conduct our recreations in such a manner that we shall be ﬁtted for the more successful discharge of
          the duties devolving upon us, and that our inﬂuence shall be more beneﬁcial upon those with whom we associate.
          Especially should it be the case upon an occasion like this, which should be of good cheer to us all. We can
          return to our homes improved in mind and refreshed in body, and prepared to engage in the work anew, with
          better hope and better courage.</p>
      <p>We believe that it is our privilege every day of our lives to glorify God upon the earth; that we are not to
          live in this world merely for our own amusement, merely to please ourselves. We are here to beneﬁt humanity,
          to be a blessing to society....</p>
      <p>We here behold the beauties of nature.... As we behold these works of nature</p>
      <p>we should let the mind be carried up higher, to nature’s God; let it be elevated to the Creator of the
          universe, and then adore the Creator who has made all these beautiful things for our beneﬁt and
          happiness.</p>
      <p>We must take periods of rest, periods of recreation, periods for contemplation.</p>
