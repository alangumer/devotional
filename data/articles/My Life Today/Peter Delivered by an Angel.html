    <h1>Peter Delivered by an Angel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Angel Guidance in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and
          hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod. Acts 12:11</p>
      <p>Peter was conﬁned in a <nobr>rock-hewn</nobr> cell, the doors of which were strongly bolted and barred.... But
          the bolts and bars and the Roman guard, which</p>
      <p>effectually cut off all possibility of human aid, were but to make more complete the triumph of God in the
          deliverance of Peter....</p>
      <p>It is the last night before the proposed execution. A mighty angel is sent from heaven to rescue Peter.... He
          enters the cell, and there lies Peter, sleeping the</p>
      <p>peaceful sleep of perfect trust....</p>
      <p>Not until he feels the touch of the angel’s hand and hears a voice saying, “Arise up quickly,” does he awaken
          sufﬁciently to see his cell illuminated by the light of heaven and an angel of great glory standing before
          him. Mechanically he obeys the word spoken to him, and as in rising he lifts his hands, he is dimly conscious
          that the chains have fallen from his wrists....</p>
      <p>He [the angel] moves toward the door, followed by the usually talkative Peter, now dumb from amazement. They
          step over the guard, and reach the heavily bolted door, which of its own accord swings open, and closes again
          immediately....</p>
      <p>The second door ... is reached. It opens ... with no creaking of hinges or rattling of iron bolts.... In the
          same way they pass through the third gateway, and</p>
      <p>ﬁnd themselves in the open street.... The angel glides on in front, encircled by a</p>
      <p>light of dazzling brightness.... Thus they pass on through one street, and then, the</p>
      <p>mission of the angel being accomplished, he suddenly disappears.</p>
      <p>Today, as verily as in the days of the apostles, heavenly messengers are passing through the length and breadth
          of the land.... We cannot see them personally;</p>
      <p>nevertheless they are with us, guiding, directing, protecting.</p>
