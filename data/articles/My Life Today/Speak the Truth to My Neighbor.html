    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of
          truth and peace in your gates. Zechariah 8:16</p>
      <p>To all who are working with Christ I would say, Wherever you can gain access to the people by the ﬁreside,
          improve your opportunity. Take your Bible, and open before them its great truths. Your success will not depend
          so much upon your knowledge and accomplishments as upon your ability to ﬁnd your way to the heart. By being
          social and coming close to the people, you may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than by the
          most able discourse.</p>
      <p>Take along the publications and ask them to read. When they see that you are sincere they will not despise any
          of your efforts. There is a way to reach the hardest hearts. Approach in the simplicity and sincerity and
          humility that will help us to reach the souls of them for whom Christ died.</p>
      <p>Allow no opportunity to pass unimproved. Visit those who live near you, and by sympathy and kindness try to
          reach their hearts. Visit the sick and suffering and show a kindly interest in them. If possible, do something
          to make them more comfortable. Through this means you can reach their hearts and speak a word for Christ.
          Eternity alone will reveal how far reaching such a line of labor can be.</p>
      <p>Those who do not take up this work, those who act with the indifference that some have manifested, will soon
          lose their ﬁrst love and will begin to censure, criticize, and condemn their own brethren.</p>
      <p>Those who go forth in the spirit of the Master, seeking to reach souls with the truth, will ... become more and
          more vitalized as they give themselves to the service of God. It is a joyous work to open the Scriptures to
          others.</p>
