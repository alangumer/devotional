      <p><strong>Perfection of Character</strong></p>
      <p>That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished
          after the similitude of a palace. Psalm 144:12</p>
      <p>If the youth rightly appreciate this important matter of <nobr>character-building,</nobr> they will see the
          necessity of doing their work so that it will stand the test of investigation before God. The humblest and
          weakest, by persevering effort in resisting temptation and seeking wisdom from above, may reach heights that
          now seem impossible. These attainments cannot come without a determined purpose to be faithful in the
          fulﬁllment of little duties. It requires constant watchfulness that crooked traits shall not be left to
          strengthen. The young may have moral power; for Jesus came into the world that He might be our example, and
          give to all youth and those of every age divine help.</p>
      <p>This world is God’s workshop, and every stone that can be used in the heavenly temple must be hewed and
          polished until it is a tried and precious stone, ﬁtted for its place in the Lord’s building. But if we refuse
          to be trained and disciplined, we shall be as stones that will not be hewed and polished, and that are cast
          aside at last as useless.</p>
      <p>It may be that much work needs to be done ... , that you are a rough stone, which must be squared and polished
          before it can ﬁll a place in God’s temple. You need not be surprised if with hammer and chisel God cuts away
          the sharp corners of your character until you are prepared to ﬁll the place He has for you. No human being can
          accomplish this work. Only by God can it be done. And be assured that He will not strike one useless blow. His
          every blow is struck in love, for your eternal happiness. He knows your inﬁrmities and works to restore, not
          to destroy.</p>
      <p>A character polished after the similitude of a palace ... may shine in the courts of the Lord forever.</p>
