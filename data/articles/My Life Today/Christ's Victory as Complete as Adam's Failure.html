    <h1>Christ’s Victory as Complete as Adam’s Failure</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Those Who Have Conquered</strong></p>
      <p>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
          righteous. Romans 5:19</p>
      <p>Christ is called the second Adam. In purity and holiness, connected with God and beloved by God, He began where
          the ﬁrst Adam began. Willingly He passed over the ground where Adam fell, and redeemed Adam’s failure.</p>
      <p>But the ﬁrst Adam was in every way more favorably situated than was Christ. The wonderful provision made for
          man in Eden was made by a God who loved him. Everything in nature was pure and undeﬁled.... Not a shadow
          interposed</p>
      <p>between them [Adam and Eve] and their Creator. They knew God as their beneﬁcent Father, and in all things their
          will was conformed to the will of God....</p>
      <p>But Satan came to the dwellers in Eden and insinuated doubts of God’s wisdom. He accused Him, their Heavenly
          Father and Sovereign, of selﬁshness, because, to test their loyalty, He had prohibited them from eating of the
          tree of knowledge....</p>
      <p>Christ was tempted by Satan in a hundredfold severer manner than was Adam, and under circumstances in every way
          more trying. The deceiver presented himself as an angel of light, but Christ withstood his temptations. He
          redeemed Adam’s disgraceful fall, and saved the world....</p>
      <p>In His human nature He maintained the purity of His divine character. He lived the law of God, and honored it
          in a world of transgression, revealing to the heavenly universe, to Satan, and to all the fallen sons and
          daughters of Adam that through His grace humanity can keep the law of God. He came to impart His own divine
          nature, His own image, to the repentant, believing soul.</p>
      <p>Christ’s victory was as complete as had been Adam’s failure. So we may resist temptation, and force Satan to
          depart from us.</p>
