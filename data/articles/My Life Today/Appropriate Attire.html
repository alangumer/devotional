      <p>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet [double
          garments, margin]. Proverbs 31:21</p>
      <p>Our clothing, while modest and simple, should be of good quality, of becoming colors, and suited for service.
          It should be chosen for durability rather than display. It should provide warmth and proper protection. The
          wise woman described in the Proverbs “is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are
          clothed with double garments.”</p>
      <p>Our dress should be cleanly. Uncleanliness in dress is unhealthful, and thus deﬁling to the body and to the
          soul....</p>
      <p>In all respects the dress should be healthful. “Above all things” God desires us to be “in
          <nobr>health”–health</nobr> of body and of soul. And we are to be workers together with Him for the health of
          both soul and body. Both are promoted by healthful dress.</p>
      <p>It should have the grace, the beauty, the appropriateness of natural simplicity. Christ has warned us against
          the pride of life, but not against its grace and natural beauty. He pointed to the ﬂowers of the ﬁeld, to the
          lily unfolding in its purity, and said, “Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.”
          Thus by the things of nature Christ illustrates the beauty that Heaven values, the modest grace, the
          simplicity, the purity, the appropriateness, that would make our attire pleasing to Him.</p>
      <p>Perfect health depends upon perfect circulation. Special attention should be given to the extremities, that
          they may be as thoroughly clothed as the chest and region over the heart.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Let our sisters dress plainly, as many do, having the dress of good material, durable, modest, appropriate for
          this age, and let not the dress question ﬁll the mind.</p>
