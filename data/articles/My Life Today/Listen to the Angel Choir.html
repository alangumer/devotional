      <p><strong>Activities in Heaven</strong></p>
      <p>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God
          in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. Luke 2:13, 14</p>
      <p>No one born into the world, not even the most gifted of God’s children, has ever been accorded such
          demonstration of joy as greeted the Babe born in Bethlehem.</p>
      <p>The angels ... appeared to the humble shepherds, guarding their ﬂocks by night, upon Bethlehem’s plains.... The
          angel of the Lord came to them, and</p>
      <p>said, “Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you
          is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you;
          Ye shall ﬁnd the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.” No sooner had their eyes become
          accustomed to the glorious presence of the one angel than, lo! the whole plain was lighted up with the
          wondrous glory of the multitude of angels that peopled the plains of Bethlehem ... , all praising God, and
          saying, “Glory to God in the highest; and on earth, peace, good will toward men.”</p>
      <p>Then was the melody of heaven heard by mortal ears, and the heavenly choir swept back to heaven as they closed
          their ever memorable anthem. The light faded away... ; but there remained in the hearts of the shepherds the
          brightest picture mortal man had ever looked upon, and the blessed promise and assurance of the advent to our
          world of the Saviour of men, which ﬁlled their hearts with joy and gladness, mingled with faith and wondrous
          love to God.</p>
      <p>O that today the human family could recognize that song! The declaration then made, the note them struck, will
          swell to the close of time and resound to the ends of the earth. When the Sun of Righteousness shall arise,
          with healing in His wings, that song will be <nobr>re-echoed</nobr> by the voice of a great multitude, as the
          voice of many waters, saying, “Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”</p>
