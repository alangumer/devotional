      <p><strong>Growing in Grace</strong></p>
      <p>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 3:18</p>
      <p>God requires that every human agent shall improve all the means of grace Heaven has provided, and become more
          and more efﬁcient in the work of God. Every provision has been made that the piety, purity, and love of the
          Christian shall ever increase, that his talents may double and his ability increase in the service of his
          divine Master. But though this provision has been made, many who profess to believe in Jesus do not make it
          manifest by growth that testiﬁes to the sanctifying power of the truth upon life and character. When we ﬁrst
          receive Jesus into our hearts, we are as babes in religion; but we are not to remain babes in experience. We
          are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; we are to attain to the full
          measure of the stature of men and women in Him. We are to make advances, to gain new and rich experiences
          through faith, growing in trust and conﬁdence and love, knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.</p>
      <p>The work of transformation from unholiness to holiness is a continuous one. Day by day God labors for man’s
          sanctiﬁcation, and man is to cooperate with Him, putting forth persevering efforts in the cultivation of right
          habits. He is to add grace to grace; and as he thus works on the plan of addition, God works for him on the
          plan of multiplication. Our Saviour is always ready to hear and answer the prayer of the contrite heart, and
          grace and peace are multiplied to His faithful ones. Gladly He grants them the blessings they need in their
          struggle against the evils that beset them.... Glorious is the hope before the believer as he advances by</p>
      <p>faith toward the heights of Christian perfection!</p>
