      <p><strong>The Way of Righteousness Is Life</strong></p>
      <p>My Consecration Today</p>
      <p>In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death. Proverbs 12:28</p>
      <p>Another year now opens its fair unwritten pages before you. The recording angel stands ready to write. Your
          course of action will determine what shall be traced by him. You may make your future life good or evil; and
          this will determine for you whether the year upon which you have just entered will be to you a happy new year.
          It is in your power to make it such for yourself and for those around you.</p>
      <p>Let patience, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> kindness, and love become a part of your very being; then whatsoever
          things are pure and lovely and of good report will mature in your experience.</p>
      <p>Angels of God are waiting to show you the path of life.... Decide now, at the</p>
      <p>commencement of the new year, that you will choose the path of righteousness, that you will be earnest and
          <nobr>true-hearted,</nobr> and that life with you shall not prove a mistake. Go forward, guided by the
          heavenly angels; be courageous; be enterprising; let your light shine; and may the words of inspiration be
          applicable to <nobr>you–“I</nobr> write unto you, young men, because you are strong and have overcome the
          wicked one.”</p>
      <p>If you have ... given yourself to Christ, you are a member of the family of God, and everything in the Father’s
          house is for you. All the treasures of God are open to you, both the world that now is and that which is to
          come. The ministry of angels, the gift of His Spirit, the labors of His <nobr>servants–all</nobr> are for you.
          The world, with everything in it, is yours so far as it can do you good. Even the enmity of the wicked will
          prove a blessing, by disciplining you for heaven. If “ye are Christ’s” “all things are yours.”</p>
