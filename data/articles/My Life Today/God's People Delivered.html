    <h1>God’s People Delivered</h1>

      <p><strong>Christ Redeems Me Unto Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads:
          they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall ﬂee away. Isaiah 35:10</p>
      <p>It is at midnight that God manifests His power for the deliverance of His people. The sun appears, shining in
          its strength. Signs and wonders follow in quick succession. The wicked look with terror and amazement upon the
          scene, while the righteous behold with solemn joy the tokens of their deliverance. Everything in nature seems
          turned out of its course.... Dark, heavy clouds come</p>
      <p>up, and clash against each other. In the midst of the angry heavens is one clear space of indescribable glory,
          whence comes the voice of God like the sound of many waters, saying, “It is done.”</p>
      <p>That voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is a mighty earthquake, “such as was not since men were upon
          the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.” The ﬁrmament appears to open and shut. The glory from the
          throne of God seems ﬂashing through. The mountains shake like a reed in the wind, and ragged rocks are
          scattered on every side....</p>
      <p>Graves are opened, and “many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth ...</p>
      <p>awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” All who have died in the faith of
          the third angel’s message come forth from the tomb gloriﬁed, to hear God’s covenant of peace with those who
          have kept His law....</p>
      <p>The voice of God is heard from heaven, declaring the day and hour of Jesus’ coming and delivering the
          everlasting covenant to His people. Like peals of loudest thunder, His words roll through the earth. The
          Israel of God stand listening, with their eyes ﬁxed upward. Their countenances are lighted up with His glory,
          and shine as did the face of Moses when he came down from Sinai. The wicked cannot look upon them. And when
          the blessing is pronounced on those who have honored God by keeping His Sabbath holy, there is a mighty shout
          of victory.</p>
