      <p><strong>Elements of Good Health</strong></p>
      <p>He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things. Acts 17:25</p>
      <p>Air is the free blessing of heaven, calculated to electrify the whole system. The lungs are constantly throwing
          off impurities, and they need to be</p>
      <p>constantly supplied with fresh air.</p>
      <p>We are more dependent upon the air we breathe than upon the food we eat. Men and women, young and old, who
          desire health, and who would enjoy active life, should remember that they cannot have these without a good
          circulation. Whatever their business and inclinations, they should make up their minds to exercise in the open
          air as much as they can. They should feel it a religious duty to overcome the conditions of health which have
          kept them conﬁned indoors, deprived of exercise in the open air.</p>
      <p>Air, the precious boon of heaven, which all may have, will bless you with its invigorating inﬂuence if you will
          not refuse it entrance. Welcome it, cultivate a love for it, and it will prove a precious soother of the
          nerves.... The inﬂuence of</p>
      <p>pure, fresh air is to cause the blood to circulate healthfully through the system. It refreshes the body and
          tends to render it strong and healthy, while at the same time its inﬂuence is decidedly felt upon the mind,
          imparting a degree of composure and serenity. It excites the appetite and renders the digestion of food more
          perfect, and induces sound, sweet sleep.</p>
      <p>The pure, invigorating air of heaven is God’s free gift to men and women, and it is impossible for them to be
          cheerful, healthful, and happy unless they appreciate these rich bounties and allow them to answer the purpose
          for which they were designed.</p>

      <p>The free, pure air of heaven is one of the richest blessings we can enjoy.</p>
