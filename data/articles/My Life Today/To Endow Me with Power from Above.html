      <p><strong>The Work of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
          in Jerusalem, in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts 1:8</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit was to descend on those who love Christ. By this they would be qualiﬁed, in and through the
          gloriﬁcation of their Head, to receive every endowment necessary for the fulﬁlling of their mission. The
          <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> held in His hand not only the keys of death but a whole heaven of rich blessings. All
          power in heaven and earth was given to Him, and having taken His place in the heavenly courts, He could
          dispense these blessings to all who receive Him. The church was baptized with the Spirit’s power. The
          disciples were ﬁtted to go forth and proclaim Christ, ﬁrst in Jerusalem, where the shameful work of
          dishonoring the rightful King had been done, and then to the uttermost parts of the earth. The evidence of the
          enthronement of Christ in His mediatorial kingdom was given.</p>
      <p>God desires that the receivers of His grace shall be witnesses to its power. Those whose course has been most
          offensive to Him He freely accepts; when they repent, He imparts to them His divine Spirit, places them in the
          highest positions of trust, and sends them forth into the camp of the disloyal to proclaim His boundless
          mercy.</p>
      <p>Provision is made by God Himself for every soul that turns to the Lord, to receive His immediate cooperation.
          The Holy Spirit becomes His efﬁciency.</p>
      <p>It is the Spirit’s power that we need. This can do more for us in one minute than we can ever accomplish by
          talking.</p>
      <p>Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of
          God awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in
          its train.</p>
