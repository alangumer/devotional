      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
          Psalm 112:4</p>
      <p>Wherever there is an impulse of love and sympathy, wherever the heart reaches out to bless and uplift others,
          there is revealed the working of God’s Holy Spirit. In the depths of heathenism men who have had no knowledge
          of the written law of God, who have never even heard the name of Christ, have been kind to His servants,
          protecting them at the risk of their own lives. Their acts show the working of a divine power. The Holy Spirit
          has implanted the grace of Christ in the heart of the savage, quickening his sympathies contrary to his
          nature, contrary to his education....</p>
      <p>Christ is seeking to uplift all who will be lifted to companionship with Himself, that we may be one with Him
          as He is one with the Father. He permits us to come in contact with suffering and calamity in order to call us
          out of our selﬁshness; He seeks to develop in us the attributes of His <nobr>character–compassion,</nobr>
          tenderness, and love. By accepting this work of ministry we place ourselves in His school, to be ﬁtted for the
          courts of God....</p>
      <p>By cooperating with heavenly beings in their work on earth, we are preparing for their companionship in heaven.
          “Ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation,” angels in heaven will
          welcome those who on earth have lived “not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” In this blessed
          companionship we shall learn, to our eternal joy, all that is wrapped up in the question, “Who is my
          neighbor?”</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Every act of love, every word of kindness, every prayer in behalf of the suffering and oppressed, is reported
          before the eternal throne and placed on heaven’s imperishable record.</p>
