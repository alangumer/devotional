      <p><strong>Living by Principle Not Inclination</strong></p>
      <p>Then the presidents and princes sought to ﬁnd occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could
          ﬁnd none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
          Daniel 6:4</p>
      <p>Daniel was subjected to the severest temptations that can assail the youth today, yet he was true to the
          religious instruction received in early life. He was surrounded with inﬂuences calculated to subvert those who
          would vacillate between principle and inclination, yet the Word of God presents him as a faultless character.
          Daniel dared not trust to his own moral power. Prayer was to him a necessity. He made God his strength, and
          the fear of God was continually before him in all the transactions of his life.... He sought to live in peace
          with all, while he</p>
      <p>was unbending as the lofty cedar wherever principle was involved. In everything that did not come in collision
          with his allegiance to God, he was respectful and obedient to those who had authority over him....</p>
      <p>In the experience of Daniel and his companions we have an instance of the triumph of principle over temptation
          to indulge the appetite. It shows us that through religious principle young men may triumph over the lusts of
          the ﬂesh, and remain true to God’s requirements.... What if Daniel and his companions had</p>
      <p>made a compromise with those heathen ofﬁcers, and had yielded to the pressure of the occasion, by eating and
          drinking as was customary with the Babylonians? That single instance of departure from principle would have
          weakened their sense of right and their abhorrence of wrong. Indulgence of appetite would have involved the
          sacriﬁce of physical vigor, clearness of intellect, and spiritual power. One wrong step would probably have
          led to others, until, their connection with Heaven being severed, they would have been swept away by
          temptation.</p>
