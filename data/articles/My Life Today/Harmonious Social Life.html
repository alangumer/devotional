    <h1>Harmonious Social Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Activities in Heaven</strong></p>
      <p>The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. Psalm 16:6</p>
      <p>The loves and sympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul shall there ﬁnd truest and sweetest
          exercise. The pure communion with holy beings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the
          faithful ones of all ages, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, the
          sacred ties that bind together “the whole family in heaven and <nobr>earth”–these</nobr> help to constitute
          the happiness of the redeemed.</p>
      <p>Amid the ransomed throng are the apostles of Christ, the heroic Paul, the ardent Peter, the loved and loving
          John, and their <nobr>true-hearted</nobr> brethren, and with them the vast host of martyrs.</p>
      <p>Heaven is full of joy. It resounds with the praise of Him who made so wonderful a sacriﬁce for the redemption
          of the human race. Should not the church on earth be full of praise? Should not Christians publish throughout
          the world the joy of serving Christ? Those who in heaven join with the angelic choir in their anthem of praise
          must learn on earth the song of heaven, the keynote of which is thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Everything in heaven is noble and elevated. All seek the interest and happiness of others. No one devotes
          himself to looking out and caring for self. It is the chief joy of all holy beings to witness the joy and
          happiness of those around them.</p>
      <p>If you have trials here, and feel lonesome, look away from this dark world to the bright glories of heaven. Set
          your affections upon heavenly joys, and then you will not feel so deeply the trials and disappointments of
          this life, for you will feel that you have a home in glory, a crown, a harp, and a lovely Saviour there.
          Strive for that blest inheritance which God has promised to those that love Him and keep His
          commandments.</p>
