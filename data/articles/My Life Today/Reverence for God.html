    <h1>Reverence for God</h1>

      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are
          about him. Psalm 89:7</p>
      <p>Another precious grace that should be carefully cherished is reverence. True reverence for God is inspired by a
          sense of His inﬁnite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the Unseen the heart of
          every child should be deeply impressed. The hour and place of prayer and the services of public worship the
          child should be taught to regard as sacred because God is there. And as reverence is manifested in attitude
          and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it will be deepened.</p>
      <p>Well would it be for young and old to study and ponder and often repeat those words of Holy Writ that show how
          the place marked by God’s special presence should be regarded.</p>
      <p>“Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,” He commanded Moses at the burning bush; “for the place whereon thou
          standest is holy ground.”</p>
      <p>Jacob, after beholding the vision of the angels, exclaimed, “The Lord is in this place; and I knew it
          not.”</p>
      <p>Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of all who come into the presence of God. In the name
          of Jesus we may come before Him with conﬁdence, but we must not approach Him with the boldness of presumption,
          as though He were on a level with ourselves. There are those who address the great and
          <nobr>all-powerful</nobr> and holy God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable, as they would address an equal,
          or even an inferior. There are those who conduct themselves in His house as they would not presume to do in
          the audience chamber of an earthly ruler. These should remember that they are in His sight whom seraphim
          adore, before whom angels veil their faces. God is greatly to be reverenced; all who truly realize His
          presence will bow in humility before Him.</p>
