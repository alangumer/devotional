      <p><strong>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it ﬁlled all the house where they
          were sitting.... And they were all</p>
      <p>ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost. Acts <nobr>2:2-4</nobr></p>
      <p>The Spirit came upon the waiting, praying disciples with a fullness that reached every heart. The Inﬁnite One
          revealed Himself in power to His church. It was as if for ages this inﬂuence had been held in restraint, and
          now Heaven rejoiced in being able to pour out upon the church the riches of the Spirit’s grace.</p>
      <p>The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the “former rain,” and glorious was the result.
          But the latter rain will be more abundant.</p>
      <p>To the end of time the presence of the Spirit is to abide with the true church. But near the end of earth’s
          harvest a special bestowal of the spiritual grace is promised, to prepare the church for the coming of the Son
          of men. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and it is for this added
          power that the Christians are to send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest “in the time of the latter
          rain.” In response, “The Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them</p>
      <p>showers of rain.” ...</p>
      <p>Those only who are constantly receiving fresh supplies of grace will have power proportionate to their daily
          need and their ability to use that power. Instead of looking forward to some future time when, through a
          special endowment of spiritual power, they will receive a miraculous ﬁtting up for soul winning, they are
          yielding themselves daily to God, that He may make them vessels meet for His use. Daily they are improving the
          opportunities for service that lie within their reach. Daily they are witnessing for the Master wherever they
          may be, whether in some humble sphere of labor in the home or in a public ﬁeld of usefulness.</p>
