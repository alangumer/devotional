    <h1>I Will Love as Christ Loved</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exercising <nobr>Self-control</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. John 13:35</p>
      <p>If we would be true lights in the world, we must manifest the loving, compassionate spirit of Christ. To love
          as Christ loved means that we must practice <nobr>self-control.</nobr> It means that we must show unselﬁshness
          at all times and in all places. It means that we must scatter round us kind words and pleasant looks. These
          cost the giver nothing, but they leave behind a precious fragrance. Their inﬂuence for good cannot be
          estimated. Not only to the receiver, but to the giver, they are a blessing; for they react upon him. Genuine
          love is a precious attribute of heavenly origin, which increases in fragrance in proportion as it is dispensed
          to others....</p>
      <p>God desires His children to remember that in order to glorify Him, they must bestow their affection on those
          who need it most. None with whom we come in contact are to be neglected. No selﬁshness in look, word, or deed
          is to be manifested to our fellow beings, whatever their position, whether they be high or low, rich or poor.
          The love that gives kind words to only a few, while others are treated with coldness and indifference, is not
          love, but selﬁshness. It will not in any way work for the good of souls or the glory of God. We are not to
          conﬁne our love to one or two objects.</p>
      <p>Those who gather the sunshine of Christ’s righteousness, and refuse to let it shine into the lives of others,
          will soon lose the sweet, bright rays of heavenly grace, selﬁshly reserved to be lavished upon a few.... Self
          should not be allowed</p>
      <p>to gather to itself a select few, giving nothing to those who need help the most. Our love is not to be sealed
          up for special ones. Break the bottle, and the fragrance will ﬁll the house.</p>
