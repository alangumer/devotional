      <p><strong>Partakers of the Divine Nature</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the ﬂesh of the Son of man, and drink his
          blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will
          raise him up at the last day. For my ﬂesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my
          ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. John <nobr>6:53-56</nobr></p>
      <p>To eat the ﬂesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He
          forgives our sins and that we are complete in Him. It is by beholding His love, by dwelling upon it, by
          drinking it in, that we are to become partakers of His nature. What food is to the body, Christ must be to the
          soul. Food cannot beneﬁt us unless we eat it, unless it becomes a part of our being. So Christ is of no value
          to us if we do not know Him as a personal Saviour. A theoretical knowledge will do us no good. We must feed
          upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life becomes our life. His love, His grace, must be
          assimilated.</p>
      <p>It is not enough even that we believe on Christ for the forgiveness of sin; we must by faith be constantly
          receiving spiritual strength and nourishment from Him through His word.... “The words that I speak unto you,
          they are spirit, and they</p>
      <p>are life.” Jesus accepted His Father’s law, wrought out its principles in His life, manifested its spirit, and
          showed its beneﬁcent power in the heart.... The followers</p>
      <p>of Christ must be partakers of His experience. They must receive and assimilate the Word of God so that it
          shall become the motive power of life and action. By the power of Christ they must be changed into His
          likeness, and reﬂect the divine attributes.</p>
      <p>It is by receiving the life for us poured out on Calvary’s cross that we can live the life of holiness. And
          this life we receive by receiving His word, by doing those things which He has commanded. Thus we become one
          with Him.</p>
