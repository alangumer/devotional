    <h1>Man Created in God’s Image</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Perfect Health</strong></p>
      <p>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. Genesis 1:26</p>
      <p>Man was the crowning act of the creation of God, made in the image of God, and designed to be a counterpart of
          God.... Man is very dear to God, because he</p>
      <p>was formed in His own image.</p>
      <p>As Adam came forth from the hand of his Creator he was of noble height and of beautiful symmetry. He was more
          than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth, and was well proportioned. His features were perfect and
          beautiful. His complexion was neither white nor sallow, but ruddy, glowing with the rich tint of health. Eve
          was not quite as tall as Adam. Her head reached a little above his shoulders. She too was noble, perfect in
          symmetry, and very beautiful.</p>
      <p>Man came from the hand of God perfect in every faculty of mind and body; in perfect soundness, therefore in
          perfect health.</p>
      <p>God endowed man with so great vital force that he has withstood the accumulation of disease brought upon the
          race in consequence of perverted habits, and has continued for six thousand years....</p>
      <p>If Adam, at his creation, had not been endowed with twenty times as much vital force as men now have, the race,
          with their present habits of living in violation of natural law, would have become extinct.</p>
      <p>Created to be “the image and glory of God,” Adam and Eve had received endowments not unworthy of their high
          destiny. Graceful and symmetrical in form, regular and beautiful in feature, their countenances glowing with
          the tint of health and the light of joy and hope, they bore in outward resemblance the likeness of their
          Maker.</p>
