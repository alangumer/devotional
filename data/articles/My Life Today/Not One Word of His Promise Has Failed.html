      <p><strong>Promises of Victory</strong></p>
      <p>Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath
          not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 1 Kings
          8:56</p>
      <p>We were favored with a sight of the most glorious sunset it was ever my privilege to behold. Language is
          inadequate to picture its beauty. The last beams of the setting sun, silver and gold, purple, amber, and
          crimson, shed their glories athwart the sky, growing brighter and brighter, rising higher and higher in the
          heavens, until it seemed that the gates of the city of God had been left ajar and gleams of the inner glory
          were ﬂashing through. For two hours the wondrous splendor continued to light up the cold northern
          <nobr>sky–a</nobr> picture painted by the great <nobr>Master-Artist</nobr> upon the shifting canvas of the
          heavens. Like the smile of God it seemed, above all earthly homes, above the <nobr>rock-bound</nobr> plains,
          the rugged mountains, the lonely forests, through which our journey lay.</p>
      <p>Angels of mercy seemed whispering, “Look up. This glory is but a gleam of the light which ﬂows from the throne
          of God. Live not for earth alone. Look up, and behold by faith the mansions of the heavenly home.” This scene
          was to me as the bow of promise to Noah, enabling me to grasp the assurance of God’s unfailing care and to
          look forward to the haven of rest awaiting the faithful worker. Ever since that time I have felt that God
          granted us this token of His love for our encouragement. Never while memory lingers can I forget that vision
          of beauty and the comfort and peace it brought.</p>
      <p>It is impossible for any mind to comprehend all the richness and greatness of even one promise of God. One
          catches the glory of one point of view, another the beauty and grace from another point, and the soul is ﬁlled
          with heavenly light.</p>
      <p>In them He is speaking to us individually.... It is in these promises that Christ</p>
      <p>communicates to us His grace and power.</p>
