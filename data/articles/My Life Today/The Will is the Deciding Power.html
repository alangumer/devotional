      <p><strong>Victory in the Conﬂict</strong></p>
      <p>Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
          that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. Romans 12:2</p>
      <p>There is nothing that can keep you away from God but a rebellious will.</p>
      <p>The will is the governing power in the nature of man. If the will is set right, all the rest of the being will
          come under its sway. The will is not the taste or the inclination, but it is the choice, the deciding power,
          the kingly power, which works in the children of men unto obedience to God or to disobedience.</p>
      <p>You will be in constant peril until you understand the true force of the will. You may believe and promise all
          things, but your promises and your faith are of no account until you put your will on the right side. If you
          will ﬁght the ﬁght of faith with your will power, there is no doubt that you will conquer.</p>
      <p>Your part is to put your will on the side of Christ. When you yield your will to His, He immediately takes
          possession of you, and works in you to will and to do of His good pleasure. Your nature is brought under the
          control of His Spirit. Even your thoughts are subject to Him. If you cannot control your impulses, your
          emotions, as you may desire, you can control the will, and thus an entire change will be wrought in your life.
          When you yield up your will to Christ, your life is hid with Christ in God. It is allied to the power which is
          above all principalities and powers. You have a strength from God that holds you fast to His strength; and a
          new life, even the life of faith, is possible to you.</p>
      <p>You can never be successful in elevating yourself, unless your will is on the side of Christ, cooperating with
          the Spirit of God. Do not feel that you cannot; but say, “I can, I will.” And God has pledged His Holy Spirit
          to help you in every decided effort.</p>
