      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy
          1:7</p>
      <p>Every organ of the body was made to be servant of the mind. The brain is the capital of the body, the seat of
          all the nervous forces and of mental action. The nerves proceeding from the brain control the body. By the
          brain nerves, mental impressions are conveyed to all the nerves of the body as by telegraph wires; and they
          control the vital action of every part of the system. All the organs of motion are governed by the
          communications they receive from the brain.</p>
      <p>The brain nerves which communicate with the entire system are the only medium through which Heaven can
          communicate with man and affect his inmost life. Whatever disturbs the circulation of the electric currents in
          the nervous system lessens the strength of the vital powers, and the result is a deadening of the
          sensibilities of the mind.</p>
      <p>Any part of the body that is not treated with consideration will telegraph its injury to the brain.</p>
      <p>It is not only the privilege, but the sacred duty, of all to understand the laws God has established in their
          beings.... And as they more fully understand the</p>
      <p>human body, ... they will seek to bring their bodies into subjection to the noble powers of the mind. The body
          will be regarded by them as a wonderful structure, formed by the Inﬁnite Designer, and given in their charge
          to keep this harp of a thousand strings in harmonious action.</p>
      <p>To make a success of Christian life, the development of sound minds in sound bodies is of the greatest
          importance.</p>
      <p>The harmonious, healthy action of all the powers of body and mind results in happiness; the more elevated and
          reﬁned the powers, the more pure and unalloyed the happiness.</p>
