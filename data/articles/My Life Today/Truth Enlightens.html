    <h1>Truth Enlightens</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what
          the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. Ephesians 1:18</p>
      <p>In a knowledge of God, all true knowledge and real development have their source. Wherever we turn, in the
          physical, the mental, or the spiritual realm; in whatever we behold, apart from the blight of sin, this
          knowledge is revealed. Whatever line of investigation we pursue with a sincere purpose to arrive at truth, we
          are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty Intelligence that is working in and through all. The mind of man
          is brought into communion with the mind of God, the ﬁnite with the Inﬁnite. The effect of such communion on
          body and mind and soul is beyond estimate.</p>
      <p>In this communion is found the highest education. It is God’s own method of development. “Acquaint now thyself
          with Him,” is His message to mankind.</p>
      <p>As he studies and meditates upon the themes into which “the angels desire to look,” he may have their
          companionship.... He may dwell in this world in the</p>
      <p>atmosphere of heaven, imparting to earth’s sorrowing and tempted ones thoughts of hope and longings for
          holiness; himself coming closer and still closer into fellowship with the Unseen; like him of old who walked
          with God, drawing nearer and nearer and threshold of the eternal world, until the portals shall open, and he
          shall enter there. He will ﬁnd himself no stranger. The voices that will greet him are the voices of the holy
          ones, who, unseen, were on earth his <nobr>companions–voices</nobr> that here he learned to distinguish and to
          love. He who through the word of God has lived in fellowship with Heaven will ﬁnd himself at home in heaven’s
          companionship.</p>
      <p>Guided by “the Spirit of truth,” he will be led into all truth.... He will be</p>
      <p>precious in the sight of heaven.</p>
