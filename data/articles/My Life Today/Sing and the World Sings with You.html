      <p><strong>Roads to Happiness That Are Never Closed</strong></p>
      <p>He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in
          the Lord. Psalm 40:3</p>
      <p>God wants us to be happy. He desires to put a new song on our lips, even praise to our God. He wants us to
          believe that He forgives our sins and takes away our unrighteousness. He wants us to make melody in our hearts
          to Him....</p>
      <p>Let every word we utter, every line we write, be fraught with encouragement and unwavering faith.... Think not
          that Jesus is the Saviour of your brother only.</p>
      <p>He is your personal Saviour. If you entertain this precious thought, you will ...</p>
      <p>make melody to God in your soul. It is our privilege to triumph in God. It is our privilege to lead others to
          see that their only hope is in God, and to ﬂee to Him for refuge.</p>
      <p>Every act of consecration to God brings joy; for as we appreciate the light He has given us, more and greater
          light will come. We must ... open the heart to the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. There is peace in
          perfect submission....</p>
      <p>Let the peace of God reign in your soul. Then you will have strength to bear all suffering, and you will
          rejoice that you have grace to endure. Praise the Lord; talk of His goodness; tell of His power. Sweeten the
          atmosphere that surrounds your soul.... Praise, with heart and soul and voice, Him who is the health of
          your</p>
      <p>countenance, your Saviour, and your God.</p>
      <p>Let praise and thanksgiving be expressed in song. When tempted, instead of giving utterance to our feelings,
          let us by faith lift up a song of thanksgiving to God. Song is a weapon that we can always use against
          discouragement. As we thus open the heart to the sunlight of the Saviour’s presence, we shall have ... His
          blessing.</p>
