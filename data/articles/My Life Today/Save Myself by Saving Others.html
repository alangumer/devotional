      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save
          thyself, and them that hear thee. 1 Timothy 4:16</p>
      <p>I have read of a man who, journeying on a winter’s day through deep drifts of snow, became benumbed by the
          cold, which was almost imperceptibly freezing his vital powers. He was nearly chilled to death, and was about
          to give up the struggle for life, when he heard the moans of a fellow traveler who was also perishing with
          cold. His sympathy was aroused, and he determined to rescue him. He chafed the <nobr>ice-cold</nobr> limbs of
          the unfortunate man, and after considerable effort raised him to his feet. As the sufferer could not stand, he
          bore him in sympathizing arms through the very drifts he had thought he could never get through alone.</p>
      <p>When he had carried his fellow traveler to a place of safety, the truth ﬂashed home to him that in saving his
          neighbor he had also saved himself. His earnest efforts to help another had quickened the blood that was
          freezing in his own veins and sent a healthy warmth to the extremities of his body.</p>
      <p>The lesson that in helping others we ourselves receive help must be urged upon young believers continually, by
          precept and example, that in their Christian experience they may gain the best results. Let the desponding
          ones, those disposed to think that the way to eternal life is trying and difﬁcult, go to work to help others.
          Such efforts, united with prayer for divine light, will cause their own hearts to throb with the quickening
          inﬂuence of the grace of God, their own affections to glow with more divine fervor. Their whole Christian life
          will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.... The testimonies borne by them in the</p>
      <p>Sabbath services will be ﬁlled with power. With joy they will bear witness to the preciousness of the
          experience they have gained in working for others.</p>
