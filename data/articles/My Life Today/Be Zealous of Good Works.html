    <h1>Be Zealous of Good Works</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Saved to Serve</strong></p>
      <p>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
          zealous of good works. Titus 2:14</p>
      <p>Christ’s followers have been redeemed for service. Our Lord teaches that the true object of life is ministry.
          Christ Himself was a worker, and to all His followers He gives the law of <nobr>service–service</nobr> to God
          and to their fellow men. Here Christ has presented to the world a higher conception of life than they had ever
          known. By living to minister for others man is brought into connection with Christ. The law of service becomes
          the connecting link which binds us to God and to our fellow men.</p>
      <p>To His servants Christ commits “His <nobr>goods”–something</nobr> to be put to use for Him. He gives “to every
          man his work.” Each has his place in the eternal plan of Heaven. Each is to work in cooperation with Christ
          for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place prepared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the
          special place designated on earth where we are to work for God....</p>
      <p>And those who would be workers together with God must strive for perfection of every organ of the body and
          quality of the mind. True education is the preparation of the physical, mental, and moral powers for the
          performance of every duty; it is the training of body, mind, and soul for divine service....</p>
      <p>Of every Christian the Lord requires growth in efﬁciency and capability in every line. Christ has paid us our
          wages, even His own blood and suffering, to secure our willing service. He came to our world to give us an
          example of how we should work and what spirit we should bring into our labor. He desires us to show how we can
          best advance His work and glorify His name in the world, crowning with honor, with the greatest love and
          devotion, the Father who “so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
          Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>
