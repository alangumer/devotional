      <p>Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Matthew
          25:34</p>
      <p>Before the ransomed throng is the holy city. Jesus opens wide the pearly gates, and the nations that have kept
          the truth enter in. There they behold the Paradise of God, the home of Adam in his innocency. Then that voice,
          richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, is heard, saying, “Your conﬂict is ended.” “Come, ye
          blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”</p>
      <p>Now is fulﬁlled the Saviour’s prayer for His disciples, “I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be
          with Me where I am.” “Faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,” Christ presents to the
          Father the purchase of His blood, declaring, “Here am I, and the children whom Thou hast given Me.” “Those
          that Thou gavest Me I have kept.” Oh, the wonders of redeeming love! the rapture of that hour when the inﬁnite
          Father, looking upon the ransomed, shall behold His image, sin’s discord banished, its blight removed, the
          human once more in harmony with the divine!</p>
      <p>Then the redeemed will be welcomed to the home that Jesus is preparing for them.... They will associate with
          those who have overcome Satan and</p>
      <p>through divine grace have formed perfect characters. Every sinful tendency, every imperfection, that afﬂicts
          them here, has been removed by the blood of Christ, and the excellence and brightness of His glory, far
          exceeding the brightness of the sun, is imparted to them. And the moral beauty, the perfection of His
          character, shines through them in worth far exceeding this outward splendor. They are without fault before the
          great white throne, sharing the dignity and the privileges of the angels.</p>
