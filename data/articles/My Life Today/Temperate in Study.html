    <h1>Temperate in Study</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Temperate in All Things</strong></p>
      <p>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a
          weariness of the ﬂesh. Ecclesiastes 12:12 Mental effort without corresponding physical exercise calls an undue
          proportion of blood to the brain, and thus the circulation is unbalanced. The brain has too much blood, while
          the extremities have too little. The hours of study and recreation should be carefully regulated, and a
          portion of the time should be spent</p>
      <p>in physical labor....</p>
      <p>The health cannot be preserved unless some portion of each day is given to muscular exertion in the open air.
          Stated hours should be devoted to manual labor of some kind, anything which will call into action all parts of
          the body. Equalize the taxation of the mental and the physical power, and the mind ... will be refreshed.</p>
      <p>The minds of thinking men labor too hard. They frequently use their mental powers prodigally, while there is
          another class whose highest aim in life is physical labor. The latter class do not exercise the mind. Their
          muscles are exercised, but their brains are robbed of intellectual strength; just as the minds of thinking men
          are worked, but their bodies are robbed of strength and vigor by their neglect to exercise the muscles....
          Health should be a sufﬁcient inducement</p>
      <p>to lead them to unite physical with mental labor.</p>
      <p>Moral, intellectual, and physical culture should be combined in order to have
          <nobr>well-developed,</nobr><nobr>well-balanced</nobr> men and women. Some are qualiﬁed to exercise great
          intellectual strength, while others are inclined to love and enjoy physical labor. Both of these classes
          should seek to improve where they are deﬁcient, that they may present to God their entire being, a living
          sacriﬁce, holy and acceptable to Him, which is their reasonable service.</p>
      <p>The health should be as carefully guarded as the character.</p>
