    <h1>True Reﬁnement</h1>

      <p><strong>Social to Save</strong></p>
      <p>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. Titus 3:2</p>
      <p>The essence of true politeness is consideration for others. The essential, enduring education is that which
          broadens the sympathies and encourages universal kindliness. That <nobr>so-called</nobr> culture which does
          not make a youth deferential toward his parents, appreciative of their excellences, forbearing toward their
          defects, and helpful to their necessities; which does not make him considerate and tender, generous and
          helpful toward the young, the old, and the unfortunate, and courteous toward all, is a failure.</p>
      <p>Real reﬁnement of thought and manner is better learned in the school of the divine Teacher than by any
          observance of set rules. His love pervading the heart gives to the character those reﬁning touches that
          fashion it in the semblance of His own. This education imparts a <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> dignity and sense of
          propriety. It gives a sweetness of disposition and a gentleness of manner that can never be equaled by the
          superﬁcial polish of fashionable society.</p>
      <p>The Bible enjoins courtesy, and it presents many illustrations of the unselﬁsh spirit, the gentle grace, the
          winsome temper, that characterize true politeness. These are but reﬂections of the character of Christ. All
          the real tenderness and courtesy in the world, even among those who do not acknowledge His name, is from Him.
          And He desires these characteristics to be perfectly reﬂected in His children. It is His purpose that in us
          men shall behold His beauty.</p>
      <p>What rays of softness and beauty shone forth in the daily life of our Saviour! What sweetness ﬂowed from His
          very presence! ... Those with whom Christ dwells will be surrounded with a divine atmosphere. Their white
          robes of purity will be fragrant with perfume from the garden of the Lord.</p>
