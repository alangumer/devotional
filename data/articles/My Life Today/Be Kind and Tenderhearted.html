    <h1>Be Kind and Tenderhearted</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven
          you. Ephesians 4:32</p>
      <p>Let the tenderness and mercy that Jesus has revealed in His own precious life be an example to us of the manner
          in which we should treat our fellow beings....</p>
      <p>Many have fainted and become discouraged in the great struggle of life, whom one word of kindly cheer and
          courage would have strengthened to overcome.... We</p>
      <p>cannot tell how far reaching may be our tender words of kindness, our <nobr>Christ-like</nobr> efforts to
          lighten some burden. The erring can be restored in no other way than in the spirit of meekness, gentleness,
          and tender love.</p>
      <p>In all your transactions with your fellow men never forget that you are dealing with God’s property. Be kind;
          be pitiful; be courteous. Respect God’s purchased possession. Treat one another with tenderness and
          courtesy.</p>
      <p>If you have enmity, suspicion, envy, and jealousy in your hearts, you have a work to do to make these things
          right. Confess your sins; come into harmony with your brethren. Speak well of them. Throw out no unfavorable
          hints, no suggestions that will awaken distrust in the minds of others. Guard their reputation as sacredly as
          you would have them guard yours; love them as you would be loved of Jesus.</p>
      <p>The grace of God leads men to place themselves in all their business transactions in the place of those with
          whom they are dealing. It leads men to look not only on their own things but also on the things of others. It
          leads them to reveal tenderness, sympathy, and kindness. Cherishing a right spirit, living a holy
          <nobr>life–this</nobr> is what being Christlike means....</p>
      <p>Let your life be controlled by the wide, generous principles of the Bible, the principles of good will,
          kindness, and courtesy.</p>
