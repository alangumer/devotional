      <p><strong>God in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Thou God seest me. Genesis 16:13</p>
      <p>God is a vigilant observer of the actions of the children of men. Nothing occurs in earth or heaven without the
          knowledge of the Creator. Nothing can happen without His permission. He on whom the fate of an empire may
          depend is watched over with a vigilance which knows no relaxation by Him who “giveth salvation unto kings,” to
          whom belong “the shields of the earth.” And the poor man is as tenderly watched over as the monarch upon his
          throne.</p>
      <p>God is constantly at work for the good of His creatures.... Times without</p>
      <p>number God has interposed to avert death, to keep men, women, and children in safety when Satan purposed a
          result wholly disastrous....</p>
      <p>This world has been signally blessed by God. Human beings are the recipients of countless mercies. Providence
          watches over and shields them. Upon them are poured the choicest gifts in heaven’s treasury.</p>
      <p>God knows you by name. He knows every action of your life.</p>
      <p>God knows every thought, every purpose, every plan, every motive.... As</p>
      <p>the artist transfers to the canvas the features of the face, so the features of each individual character are
          transferred to the books of heaven. God has a perfect photograph of every man’s character.</p>
      <p>God wants you to recognize the divine presence. His peace and comfort and grace and joy will change the shadow
          of death into bright morning and blessed sunshine.... A reverential spirit realizes that the heart must be
          kept by the power</p>
      <p>of God. Ministering angels open the eyes of the mind and heart to see wonderful things in the divine law, in
          the natural world, and in the eternal things revealed by the Holy Spirit.</p>
