    <h1>Fear Not</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ Is Close Beside You</strong></p>
      <p>Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. Isaiah 43:1</p>
      <p>Often our trials are such that they seem almost unbearable, and without help from God they are indeed
          unbearable. Unless we rely upon Him we shall sink under the burden of responsibilities that bring only sadness
          and grief. But if we make Christ our dependence, we shall not sink under trial. When all seems dark and
          unexplainable we are to trust in His love; we must repeat the words that Christ has spoken to our souls, “What
          I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.” ...</p>
      <p>Do not go about as if Jesus were in Joseph’s tomb, and a great stone were rolled before the door.... In the
          trial of your faith show that you know you have a</p>
      <p>risen Saviour, One who is making intercession for you and your loved ones....</p>
      <p>The Bible places the responsibility of our happiness upon ourselves. We are to look to the light of life. Our
          usefulness depends on our own course of action.</p>
      <p>We are so anxious, all of us, for happiness, but many rarely ﬁnd it because of their faulty methods of seeking,
          in the place of striving. We must strive most earnestly and mingle all our desires with faith. Then happiness
          steals in upon us almost unsought.... When we can, notwithstanding disagreeable circumstances,</p>
      <p>rest conﬁdingly in His love and shut ourselves in with Him, resting peacefully in His love, the sense of His
          presence will inspire a deep, tranquil joy. This experience gains for us a faith that enables us not to fret,
          not to worry, but to depend upon a power that is inﬁnite.</p>
      <p>We shall have the power of the Highest with us.... Jesus stands by our side....</p>
      <p>As the trials come, the power of God will come with them.</p>
