      <p><strong>Angel Guidance in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of
          his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. Psalm 103:20,
          21</p>
      <p>Angelic agencies, though invisible, are cooperating with visible human agencies, forming a relief association
          with men. Is there not something stimulating and inspiring in this thought that the human agent stands as the
          visible instrument to confer the blessings of angelic agencies? As we are thus laborers together with God, the
          work bears the inscription of the divine. With what joy and delight all heaven looks upon these blended
          inﬂuences, inﬂuences which are acknowledged in the heavenly courts! Human agencies are the hands of heavenly
          instrumentalities, for heavenly angels employ human hands in practical ministry. Their acts of unselﬁsh
          ministry make them partakers in the success which is a result of the relief offered. This is Heaven’s way of
          administering saving power. The knowledge and actions of the heavenly order of workers, united with the
          knowledge and power which are imparted to human agencies, relieve the oppressed and distressed.</p>
      <p>The very angels who when Satan was seeking the supremacy fought the battle in the heavenly courts, and
          triumphed on the side of God; the very angels who from their exalted position shouted for joy over the
          creation of our world, and over the creation of our ﬁrst parents, who were to inhabit the earth ... are most
          intensely interested to work in union with the fallen, redeemed race in the development of that power which
          God gives to help every man who will unite with heavenly intelligences to seek and save human beings who are
          perishing in their sins....</p>
      <p>Human agencies are called to be hand helpers, to work out the knowledge and use the facilities of heavenly
          angels. By uniting with these powers that are omnipotent, we shall be beneﬁted by their higher education and
          experience....</p>
      <p>Such a cooperation will accomplish a work which will give honor and glory and majesty to God.</p>
