    <h1>A Merry Heart Is Good Medicine</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>A merry [rejoicing] heart doeth good like a medicine. Proverbs 17:22 The relation that exists between the mind
          and the body is very intimate. When</p>
      <p>one is affected the other sympathizes. The condition of the mind affects the health to a far greater degree
          than many realize. Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result of mental depression. Grief,
          anxiety, discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, all tend to break down the life forces and to invite decay and
          death.</p>
      <p>Disease is sometimes produced, and is often greatly aggravated, by the imagination. Many are lifelong invalids
          who might be well if they only thought so....</p>
      <p>Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and prolong life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is
          health to the body and strength to the soul.</p>
      <p>Gratitude, rejoicing, benevolence, trust in God’s love and <nobr>care–these</nobr> are health’s greatest
          safeguard.</p>
      <p>The power of the will and the importance of <nobr>self-control,</nobr> both in the preservation and in the
          recovery of health, the depressing and even ruinous effect of anger, discontent, selﬁshness, or impurity, and,
          on the other hand, the marvelous <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power to be found in cheerfulness, unselﬁshness,
          gratitude, should also be shown.</p>
      <p>There is a physiological <nobr>truth–truth</nobr> that we need to <nobr>consider–in</nobr> the scripture, “A
          merry [rejoicing] heart doeth good like a medicine.”</p>
      <p>The true principles of Christianity open before all a source of inestimable happiness.</p>
      <p>We should encourage a cheerful, hopeful, peaceful frame of mind; for our health depends upon our so doing.</p>
