    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Promises of Victory</strong></p>
      <p>Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his anger
          endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
          Psalm 30:4, 5</p>
      <p>To blot the promises of God from the Word would be like blotting the sun from the sky. There would then be
          nothing to gladden our experience. God has placed the promises in His Word to lead us to have faith in Him. In
          these promises He draws back the veil from eternity, giving us a glimpse of the far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory which awaits the overcomer. Let us, then, rest in God. Let us praise Him for giving us such a
          glorious revelation of His purposes.</p>
      <p>All along our pathway God places the ﬂowers of promise to brighten our journey. But many refuse to gather these
          ﬂowers, choosing instead the thorns and thistles. At every step they weep and mourn, when they might rejoice
          in the Lord because He has made the road to heaven so pleasant.</p>
      <p>As we look at the promises of God we ﬁnd comfort and hope and joy, for they speak to us the words of the
          Inﬁnite One. Properly to appreciate these precious promises we should study them carefully, examining them in
          detail. How much joy we might bring into life, how much goodness into the character, if we would but make
          these promises our own! As we journey in the upward way, let us talk of the blessings strewn along the path.
          As we think of the mansions Christ is preparing for us, we forget the petty annoyances which we meet day by
          day. We seem to breathe the atmosphere of the heavenly country to which we are journeying, and we are soothed
          and comforted.... Let us honor God by weaving</p>
      <p>more of Jesus and heaven into our lives.</p>
      <p>The unfailing promises of God will keep your heart in perfect peace.</p>
