      <p><strong>Friendly Sociability</strong></p>
      <p>A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly. Proverbs 18:24</p>
      <p>In the arrangements for the education of the chosen people it is made manifest that a life centered in God is a
          life of completeness. Every want He has implanted, He provides to satisfy; every faculty imparted, He seeks to
          develop.</p>
      <p>The Author of all beauty, Himself a lover of the beautiful, God provided to gratify in His children the love of
          beauty. He made provision also for their social needs, for the kindly and helpful associations that do so much
          to cultivate sympathy and to brighten and sweeten life.</p>
      <p>Christian sociability is altogether too little cultivated by God’s people.... By</p>
      <p>social intercourse acquaintances are formed and friendships contracted which result in a unity of heart and an
          atmosphere of love which is pleasing in the sight of heaven.</p>
      <p>Everyone will ﬁnd companions or make them. And just in proportion to the strength of the friendship, will be
          the amount of inﬂuence which friends will exert over one another for good or for evil. All will have
          associates, and will inﬂuence and be inﬂuenced in their turn.</p>
      <p>The link is a mysterious one which binds human hearts together, so that the feelings, tastes, and principles of
          two individuals are closely blended. One catches the spirit and copies the ways and acts of the other. As wax
          retains the ﬁgure of the seal, so the mind retains the impression produced by intercourse and association. The
          inﬂuence may be unconscious, yet it is no less powerful.... If choice is made</p>
      <p>of companions who fear the Lord, the inﬂuence will lead to truth, to duty, and to holiness. A truly Christian
          life is a power for God.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>The warmth of true friendship ... is a foretaste of the joys of heaven.</p>
