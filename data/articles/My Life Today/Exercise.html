      <p><strong>Keeping Physically Fit</strong></p>
      <p>The glory of young men is their strength. Proverbs 20:29</p>
      <p>Another precious blessing is proper exercise. Each organ and muscle has its work to do in the living organism.
          Every wheel in the machinery must be a living, active, working wheel. Nature’s ﬁne and wonderful works need to
          be kept in active motion in order to accomplish the object for which they were designed.</p>
      <p>Bind up an arm, even for a few weeks, then free it from its bands, and you will see that it is weaker than the
          one you have been using moderately during the same time. Inactivity produces the same effect upon the whole
          muscular system.</p>
      <p>Inactivity is a fruitful cause of disease. Exercise quickens and equalizes the circulation of the blood.</p>
      <p>For a healthy young man, stern, severe exercise is strengthening to the whole system.... Without such exercise
          the mind cannot be kept in working order. It</p>
      <p>becomes inactive, unable to put forth the sharp, quick action that will give scope to its powers....</p>
      <p>All the heavenly beings are in constant activity, and the Lord Jesus, in His lifework, has given an example for
          every one. He went about “doing good.” God has established the law of obedient action. Silent but ceaseless,
          the objects of His creation do their appointed work. The ocean is in constant motion. The springing grass,
          which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, does its errand, clothing the ﬁelds with beauty. The
          leaves are stirred to motion, and yet no hand is seen to touch them. The sun, moon, and stars are useful and
          glorious in fulﬁlling their mission.... And man, his mind and body created in God’s own similitude, must
          be</p>
      <p>active in order to ﬁll his appointed place. Action gives power.</p>
