      <p><strong>Growing in Grace</strong></p>
      <p>God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufﬁciency in all things, may
          abound to every good work: (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his
          righteousness remaineth for ever.) 2 Corinthians 9:8, 9</p>
      <p>Many are longing to grow in grace; they pray over the matter, and are surprised that their prayers are not
          answered. The Master has given them a work to do whereby they shall grow. Of what value is it to pray when
          there is need of work? The question is, Are they seeking to save souls for whom Christ died? Spiritual growth
          depends upon giving to others the light that God has given to you. You are to put forth your best thoughts in
          active labor to do good, and only good, in your family, in your church, and in your neighborhood.</p>
      <p>In place of growing anxious with the thought that you are not growing in grace, just do every duty that
          presents itself, carry the burden of souls on your heart, and by every conceivable means seek to save the
          lost. Be kind, be courteous, be pitiful; speak in humility of the blessed hope; talk of the love of Jesus;
          tell of His goodness, His mercy, and His righteousness; and cease to worry as to whether or not you are
          growing. Plants do not grow through any conscious effort.... The plant</p>
      <p>is not in continual worriment about its growth; it just grows under the supervision of God.</p>
      <p>The only way to grow in grace is to be interestedly doing the very work Christ has enjoined upon us to
          <nobr>do–interestedly</nobr> engaged to the very extent of our ability to be helping and blessing those who
          need the help we can give them.... Christians who are constantly growing in earnestness, in zeal, in
          fervor,</p>
      <p>in <nobr>love–such</nobr> Christians never backslide.... Their wisdom is increasing, [and] their</p>
      <p>ability [in] how to work. They seem to comprehend the largest plans. They are ready to engage in the most
          stirring enterprises, and they have no room for slothfulness; they cannot ﬁnd a place for stagnation.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>The treasures of grace are absolutely unlimited.</p>
