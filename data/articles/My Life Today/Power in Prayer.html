    <h1>Power in Prayer</h1>

      <p><strong>Prayer in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do. John 14:13</p>
      <p>The petitions of a humble heart and contrite spirit he will not despise. The opening of our hearts to our
          heavenly Father, the acknowledgment of our entire dependence, the expression of our wants, the homage of
          grateful <nobr>love–this</nobr> is true prayer.</p>
      <p>Angels record every prayer that is earnest and sincere. We should rather dispense with selﬁsh gratiﬁcations
          than neglect communion with God. The deepest poverty, the greatest <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> with His
          approval, is better than riches, honors, ease, and friendship without it. We must take time to pray. If we
          allow our minds to be absorbed by worldly interests, the Lord may give us time by removing from us our idols
          of gold, of houses, or of fertile lands.</p>
      <p>The young would not be seduced into sin if they would refuse to enter any path save that upon which they could
          ask God’s blessing. If the messengers who bear the last solemn warning to the world would pray for the
          blessing of God, not in a cold, listless, lazy manner, but fervently and in faith, as did Jacob, they would
          ﬁnd many places where they could say, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” They would be
          accounted of heaven as princes, having power to prevail with God and with men.</p>
      <p>True prayer, offered in faith, is a power to the petitioner. Prayer, whether offered in the public assembly, at
          the family altar, or in secret, places man directly in the presence of God. By constant prayer the youth may
          obtain principles so ﬁrm that the most powerful temptations will not draw them from their allegiance to
          God.</p>
      <p>The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian</p>
      <p>... are those victories that are gained in the audience chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays
          hold upon the mighty arm of power.</p>
