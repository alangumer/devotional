    <h1>The Shield of Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Equipped for Victory</strong></p>
      <p>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the ﬁery darts of the wicked.
          Ephesians 6:16</p>
      <p>Faith in God’s Word, prayerfully studied and practically applied, will be our shield from Satan’s power and
          will bring us off conquerors through the blood of Christ.</p>
      <p>When souls are converted their salvation is not yet accomplished. They then have the race to run; the arduous
          struggle is before them to do, what? “To ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith,” to press forward to the mark for the
          prize of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus. There is no release in this warfare; the battle is
          lifelong, and must be carried forward with determined energy proportionate to the value of the object you are
          in pursuit of, which is eternal life. Immense interests are here involved. We are made partakers of Christ’s
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> here in this life, and then we are assured that we shall be partakers of all its
          beneﬁts in the future immortal life, if we hold the beginning of our conﬁdence steadfast unto the end. Think
          of this.</p>
      <p>The promise is, “God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with
          the temptation also make a way to escape.” Maintain to the last your Christian integrity, and do not murmur
          against God.... Consider</p>
      <p>that eternal interests are here involved. You cannot afford to become discouraged and cast away your conﬁdence.
          The Lord loves you, trust in the Lord. The Lord Jesus is your only hope. Make sure work for eternity. You must
          not murmur or complain or condemn yourself. Neglect no means of grace. Encourage your soul to believe and to
          trust in God.</p>
      <p>In the Lord we have righteousness and strength. Lean upon Him, and through His power you may quench all the
          ﬁery darts of the adversary and come off more than conqueror.</p>
