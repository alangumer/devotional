      <p>It is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. Matthew 12:12</p>
      <p>According to the fourth commandment the Sabbath was dedicated to rest and religious worship. All secular
          employment was to be suspended, but works of mercy and benevolence were in accordance with the purpose of the
          Lord. They were not to be limited by time or place. To relieve the afﬂicted, to comfort the sorrowing, is a
          labor of love that does honor to God’s holy day.</p>
      <p>The necessities of life must be attended to, the sick must be cared for, the wants of the needy must be
          supplied. He will not be held guiltless who neglects to relieve suffering on the Sabbath. God’s holy rest day
          was made for man, and acts of mercy are in perfect harmony with its intent. God does not desire His creatures
          to suffer an hour’s pain that may be relieved upon the Sabbath or any other day....</p>
      <p>The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactivity. The law forbids secular labor on the rest day
          of the Lord; the toil that gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly pleasure or proﬁt is lawful
          upon that day; but as God ceased His labor of creating, and rested upon the Sabbath and blessed it, so man is
          to leave the occupations of his daily life and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to
          holy deeds. The work of Christ in healing the sick was in perfect accord with the law. It honored the
          Sabbath.</p>
      <p>Labor to relieve the suffering was pronounced by our Saviour a work of mercy and no violation of the
          Sabbath.</p>
      <p>The needs of suffering humanity are never to be neglected. The Saviour, by His example, has shown us that it is
          right to relieve suffering on the Sabbath.</p>
