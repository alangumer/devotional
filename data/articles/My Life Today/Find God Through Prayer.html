    <h1>Find God Through Prayer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Prayer in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek
          me, and ﬁnd me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. Jeremiah 29:12, 13</p>
      <p>There are two kinds of <nobr>prayer–the</nobr> prayer of form and the prayer of faith. The repetition of set,
          customary phrases when the heart feels no need of God, is formal prayer.... We should be extremely careful in
          all our prayers to speak the</p>
      <p>wants of the heart and to say only what we mean. All the ﬂowery words at our command are not equivalent to one
          holy desire. The most eloquent prayers are but vain repetitions if they do not express the true sentiments of
          the heart. But the prayer that comes from an earnest heart, when the simple wants of the soul are expressed
          just as we would ask an earthly friend for a favor, expecting that it would be <nobr>granted–this</nobr> is
          the prayer of faith. The publican who went up to the temple to pray is a good example of a sincere, devoted
          worshiper. He felt that he was a sinner, and his great need led to an outburst of passionate desire, “God be
          merciful to me a sinner.” ....</p>
      <p>After we have offered our petitions, we are to answer them ourselves as far as possible, and not wait for God
          to do for us what we can do for ourselves. The help of God is held in reserve for all who demand it. Divine
          help is to be combined with human effort, aspiration, and energy. But we cannot reach the battlements of
          heaven without climbing for ourselves. We cannot be borne up by the prayers of others when we ourselves
          neglect to pray; for God has made no such provision for us.... The unlovely traits in our characters are not
          removed, and replaced by</p>
      <p>traits that are pure and lovely, without some effort on our part....</p>
      <p>In our efforts to follow the copy set us by our Lord, we shall make crooked lines.... Yet let us not cease our
          efforts.... Temporary failure should make us lean</p>
      <p>more heavily on Christ.</p>
