      <p><strong>Victory in the Conﬂict</strong></p>
      <p>Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me. Isaiah
          27:5</p>
      <p>The enemy cannot overcome the humble learner of Christ, the one who walks prayerfully before the Lord. Christ
          interposes Himself as a shelter, a retreat, from the assaults of the wicked one. The promise is given, “When
          the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.” ...</p>
      <p>Satan was permitted to tempt the <nobr>too-conﬁdent</nobr> Peter, as he had been permitted to tempt Job; but
          when that work was done he had to retire. Had Satan been suffered to have his way, there would have been no
          hope for Peter. He would have made complete shipwreck of faith. But the enemy dare not go one hairbreadth
          beyond his appointed sphere. There is no power in the whole satanic force that can disable the soul that
          trusts, in simple conﬁdence, in the wisdom that comes from God.</p>
      <p>Christ is our tower of strength, and Satan can have no power over the soul that walks with God in humility of
          mind. The promise, “Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace
          with Me.” In Christ there is perfect and complete help for every tempted soul. Dangers beset every path, but
          the whole universe of heaven is standing on guard, that none may be tempted above that which he is able to
          bear. Some have strong traits of character, that will need to be constantly repressed. If kept under the
          control of the Spirit of God, these traits will be a blessing; but if not, they will prove a curse.... If we
          will give ourselves unselﬁshly to the work, never swerving in the</p>
      <p>least from principle, the Lord will throw about us the everlasting arms, and will prove a mighty helper. If we
          will look to Jesus as the One in whom we may trust, He will never fail us in any emergency.</p>
