      <p><strong>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:
          against such there is no law. Galatians 5:22, 23</p>
      <p>To all who believe, He is as the tree of life in the Paradise of God. His branches reach to this world, that
          the blessings which He has purchased for us may be brought within our reach.... He has given us a Comforter,
          the Holy Spirit, which</p>
      <p>will present to us the precious fruit from the tree of life. From this tree we may pluck and eat, and we may
          then guide others to it, that they also may eat.</p>
      <p>The man who loves God meditates on the law of God day and night. He is instant in season and out of season. He
          bears the fruit of a branch vitally connected with the Vine. As he has opportunity, he does good; and
          everywhere, at all times and in all places, he ﬁnds opportunity to work for God. He is one of the Lord’s
          evergreen trees; and he carries fragrance with him wherever he goes. A wholesome atmosphere surrounds his
          soul. The beauty of his <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> life and godly conversation inspires faith and hope and
          courage in others. This is Christianity in practice. Seek to be an evergreen tree. Wear the ornament of a meek
          and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. Cherish the grace of love, joy, peace,
          longsuffering, gentleness. This is the fruit of the Christian tree. Planted by the rivers of water, it always
          brings forth its fruit in due season.</p>
      <p>If we have the love of Christ in our souls, it will be a natural consequence for us to have all the other
          <nobr>graces–joy,</nobr> peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance....</p>
      <p>When the love of Christ is enshrined in the heart, ... His presence will be felt.</p>
