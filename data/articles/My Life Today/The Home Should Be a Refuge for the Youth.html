      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me. Mark 9:37</p>
      <p>Our homes should be a place of refuge for the tempted youth. Many there are who stand at the parting of the
          ways. Every inﬂuence, every impression, is determining the choice that shapes their destiny both here and
          hereafter.</p>
      <p>Do not hold yourselves aloof from them, but come close to them. Bring them to your ﬁresides; invite them to
          your family altars. There is work that thousands need to have done for them. Every tree in Satan’s garden is
          hung with tempting, poisonous fruit, and a woe is pronounced upon every one who plucks and eats.</p>
      <p>Evil invites them. Its resorts are made bright and attractive. They have a welcome for every comer. All about
          us are youth who have no home and many whose homes have no helpful, uplifting power, and the youth drift into
          evil. They are going down to ruin within the very shadow of our own doors.</p>
      <p>These youth need a hand stretched out to them in sympathy. Kind words simply spoken, little attentions simply
          bestowed, will sweep away the clouds of temptation which gather over the soul. The true expression of
          <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> sympathy has power to open the door of hearts that need the fragrance of Christlike
          words and the simple, delicate touch of the spirit of Christ’s love. If we would show an interest in the
          youth, invite them to our homes, and surround them with cheering, helpful inﬂuences, there are many who would
          gladly turn their steps into the upward path.</p>
      <p>Remember that happiness will not be found in shutting yourselves up to yourselves, satisﬁed to pour out all
          your affection upon each other. Seize upon every opportunity for contributing to the happiness of those around
          you.... True</p>
      <p>joy can be found only in unselﬁsh service.</p>
