      <p><strong>Those Who Have Conquered</strong></p>
      <p>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.
          Matthew 11:11</p>
      <p>The tall reeds that grew beside the Jordan, bending before every breeze, were ﬁtting representatives of the
          rabbis who had stood as critics and judges of the Baptist’s mission. They were swayed this way and that by the
          winds of popular opinion. They would not humble themselves to receive the <nobr>heart-searching</nobr> message
          of the Baptist, yet for fear of the people they dared not openly oppose his work. But God’s messenger was of
          no such craven spirit. The multitudes who were gathered about Christ had been witnesses to the work of John.
          They had heard his fearless rebuke of sin. To the <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> Pharisees, the priestly
          Sadducees, King Herod and his court, princes and soldiers, publicans and peasants, John had spoken with equal
          plainness. He was no trembling reed, swayed by the winds of human praise or prejudice. In the prison he was
          the same in his loyalty to God and his zeal for righteousness as when he preached God’s message in the
          wilderness. In his faithfulness to principle he was as ﬁrm as a rock....</p>
      <p>In the announcement to Zacharias before the birth of John, the angel had declared, “He shall be great in the
          sight of the Lord.” In the estimation of Heaven, what is it that constitutes <nobr>greatness?–Not</nobr> that
          which the world accounts greatness.... It is moral worth that God values. Love and purity are the
          attributes</p>
      <p>He prizes most. John was great in the sight of the Lord, when before the messengers from the Sanhedrim, before
          the people, and before his own disciples he refrained from seeking honor for himself, but pointed all to Jesus
          as the Promised One. His unselﬁsh joy in the ministry of Christ presents the highest type of nobility ever
          revealed in man.</p>
