    <h1>With Liberality</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I Too May Conquer</strong></p>
      <p>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth
          to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Proverbs
          11:24, 25</p>
      <p>It is God who blesses men with property, and He does this that they may be able to give toward the advancement
          of His cause. He sends the sunshine and the rain. He causes vegetation to ﬂourish. He gives health and the
          ability to acquire means. All our blessings come from His bountiful hand. In turn, He would have men and women
          show their gratitude by returning Him a portion in tithes and <nobr>offerings–in</nobr> thank offerings, in
          freewill offerings, in trespass offerings. Should means ﬂow into the treasury in accordance with this divinely
          appointed <nobr>plan–a</nobr> tenth of all the increase, and liberal <nobr>offerings–there</nobr> would be an
          abundance for the advancement of the Lord’s work.</p>
      <p>But the hearts of men become hardened through selﬁshness, and like Ananias and Sapphira, they are tempted to
          withhold part of the price, while pretending to fulﬁll God’s requirements. Many spend money lavishly in
          <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation.</nobr> Men and women consult their pleasure and gratify their taste, while they bring
          to God, almost unwillingly, a stinted offering. They forget that God will one day demand a strict account of
          how His goods have been used.</p>
      <p>Constant, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> benevolence is God’s remedy for the cankering sins of selﬁshness and
          covetousness. God has arranged systematic benevolence to sustain His cause and relieve the necessities of the
          suffering and needy. He has ordained that giving should become a habit, that it may counteract the dangerous
          and deceitful sin of covetousness. Continual giving starves covetousness to death....</p>
      <p>He requires the constant exercise of benevolence, that the force of habit in good works may break the force of
          habit in an opposite direction.</p>
