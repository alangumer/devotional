      <p><strong>Heroes for God</strong></p>
      <p>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning ﬁery furnace, and he will deliver us
          out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor
          worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Daniel 3:17, 18</p>
      <p>A severe test came to ... these youth when Nebuchadnezzar issued a proclamation, calling upon all the ofﬁcers
          of the kingdom to assemble at the dedication of the great image, and at the sound of the musical instruments,
          to bow down and worship it. Should any fail of doing this, they were immediately to be cast into the midst of
          a burning ﬁery furnace. The worship of this image had been brought about by the wise men of Babylon in order
          to make the Hebrew youth join in their idolatrous worship. They were beautiful singers, and the Chaldeans
          wanted them to forget their God and accept the worship of the Babylonian idols.</p>
      <p>The appointed day came, and at the sound of the music, the vast company that had assembled at the king’s
          command “fell down and worshiped the golden image.” But these faithful young men would not bow down ....</p>
      <p>Then the king commanded the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than it was wont to be heated; and when
          this was done, the three Hebrews were cast in. So furious were the ﬂames that the men who cast the Hebrews in
          were burned to death.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the countenance of the king paled with terror.... His voice trembling</p>
      <p>with excitement, the monarch exclaimed, “Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the ﬁre, and they
          have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.”</p>
      <p>From age to age the heroes of faith have been marked by their ﬁdelity to God, and they have been brought
          conspicuously before the world that their light might shine to those in darkness. Daniel and his three
          companions are illustrious examples of Christian heroism.... From their experience in the court of
          Babylon</p>
      <p>we may learn what God will do for those who serve Him with full purpose of heart.</p>
