      <p><strong>Pure Religion Deﬁned</strong></p>
      <p>I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. Job 29:16</p>
      <p>This was an evidence that Job had righteousness that was after Christ’s order. Through Jesus men may possess a
          spirit of tender pity toward the needy and distressed.... He descended to the lowest humiliation and was
          obedient unto death,</p>
      <p>even the death of the cross, that He might exalt us to be joint heirs with Himself. The whole world was in need
          of that which Christ alone could give them. He did not withdraw Himself from those who called upon Him for
          help. He did not do as many now do, say, “I wish they would not trouble me with their affairs. I want to hoard
          up my means, to invest it in houses and lands.” Jesus, the Majesty of heaven, turned from the splendor of His
          heavenly home, and in the gracious purpose of His heart He demonstrated the character of God to men throughout
          the world.</p>
      <p>Take away poverty, and we should have no way of understanding the mercy and love of God, no way of knowing the
          compassionate and sympathetic heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>First meet the temporal necessities of the needy and relieve their physical wants and sufferings, and you will
          then ﬁnd an open avenue to the heart, where you may plant the good seeds of virtue and religion.</p>
      <p>Never does the gospel put on an aspect of greater loveliness than when it is brought to the most needy and
          destitute regions.... Truth from the Word of God</p>
      <p>enters the hovel of the peasant and lights up the rude cottages of the poor.... Rays</p>
      <p>from the Sun of Righteousness bring gladness to the sick and suffering. Angels of God are there.... Those who
          have been loathed and abandoned are raised through</p>
      <p>faith and pardon to the dignity of sons and daughters of God.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Christianity is the solace of the poor.</p>
