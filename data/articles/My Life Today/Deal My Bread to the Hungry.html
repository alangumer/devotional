      <p><strong>Pure Religion Deﬁned</strong></p>
      <p>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? Isaiah
          58:7</p>
      <p>What is pure religion? Christ has told us that pure religion is the exercise of pity, sympathy, and love, in
          the home, in the church, and in the world....</p>
      <p>We are to think and care for others who need our love, our tenderness, and care. We should ever remember that
          we are representatives of Christ, and that we are to share the blessings that He gives, not with those who can
          recompense us again, but with those who will appreciate the gifts that will supply their temporal and
          spiritual necessities. Those who give feasts for the purpose of helping those who have but little pleasure,
          for the purpose of bringing brightness into their dreary lives, for the purpose of relieving their poverty and
          distress, are acting unselﬁshly and in harmony with the instruction of Christ.</p>
      <p>All around us we see want and suffering. Families are in need of food; little ones are crying for bread. The
          houses of the poor lack proper furniture and bedding. Many live in mere hovels which are almost destitute of
          conveniences. The cry of the poor reaches to heaven. God sees; God hears.</p>
      <p>The work of gathering in the needy ... is the very work which every church that believes the truth for this
          time should long since have been doing. We are to show the tender sympathy of the Samaritan in supplying
          physical necessities, feeding the hungry, bringing the poor that are cast out to our homes, gathering from God
          every day grace and strength that will enable us to reach to the very depths of human misery and help those
          who cannot possibly help themselves. In doing this work we have a favorable opportunity to set forth Christ
          the cruciﬁed One.</p>
