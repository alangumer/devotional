      <p><strong>Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Ephesians 4:7</p>
      <p>The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the
          Holy Spirit. “To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
          Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another
          the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
          tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
          dividing to every man severally as He will.” All men do not receive the same gifts, but to every servant of
          the Master some gift of the Spirit is promised.</p>
      <p>Before He left His disciples, Christ “breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” Again
          he said, “Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you.” ... “Unto every one of us is given grace,
          according to the measure of the gift of Christ,” the Spirit “dividing to every man severally as He will.” The
          gifts are already ours in Christ, but their actual possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit of
          God.</p>
      <p>God does not ask us to do in our own strength the work before us. He has provided divine assistance for all the
          emergencies to which our human resources are unequal. He gives the Holy Spirit to help in every strait, to
          strengthen our hope and assurance, to illuminate our minds and purify our hearts.... There is no limit</p>
      <p>to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his
          heart and lives a life wholly consecrated to God....</p>
      <p>Christ declared that the divine inﬂuence of the Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end.</p>
