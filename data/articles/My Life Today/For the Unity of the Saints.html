      <p><strong>Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>I ... beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness,
          with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
          peace. Ephesians <nobr>4:1-3</nobr></p>
      <p>The stars of heaven are all under law, each inﬂuencing the other to do the will of God, yielding their common
          obedience to the law that controls their action. And, in order that the Lord’s work may advance healthfully
          and solidly, His people must draw together.</p>
      <p>The spasmodic, ﬁtful movements of some who claim to be Christians are well represented by the work of strong
          but untrained horses. When one pulls forward, another pulls back, and at the voice of their master, one
          plunges ahead, and the other stands immovable. If men will not move in concert in the great and grand work for
          this time, there will be confusion.... If men wear the yoke of Christ, they</p>
      <p>cannot pull apart; they will draw with Christ....</p>
      <p>To the prophet, the wheel within a wheel, the appearance of living creatures connected with them, all seemed
          intricate and unexplainable. But the hand of inﬁnite wisdom is seen among the wheels, and perfect order is the
          result of its work. Every wheel, directed by the hand of God, works in perfect harmony with every other
          wheel.</p>
      <p>By the inﬂuence of the Spirit, the most discordant may be brought into harmony. Unselﬁshness is to bind God’s
          people together with ﬁrm, tender bonds. There is a vast power in the church when the energies of the members
          are under the control of the Spirit, gathering good from every source, educating, training, and disciplining
          self. Thus is presented to God a powerful organization, through which He can work for the conversion of
          sinners. Thus heaven and earth are connected, and all divine agencies cooperate with human
          instrumentalities.</p>
