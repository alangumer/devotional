      <p><strong>Faith in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength. Isaiah 26:4</p>
      <p>His is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory and the majesty. Let us not limit the Holy One of
          Israel....</p>
      <p>What a source to which we can look in all times of trouble; the heart can have no misgivings! Man is erring,
          stubborn, rebellious, and deﬁant even against God; but the Lord is kind and patient and of tender compassion.
          He has heaven and earth at His command, and He knows just what we need even before we present our necessities
          and desires before Him.</p>
      <p>We can see only a little way before us; “but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we
          have to do.” He never becomes confused. He sits above the confusion and distractions of the earth, and all
          things are opened to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He can order that which His
          providence sees is best.</p>
      <p>If we were left to ourselves to plan, we should make mistakes. Our prejudices, our weaknesses, our
          <nobr>self-deceptions,</nobr> and our ignorances would be manifest in many ways. But the work is the Lord’s,
          the cause is His; He never leaves His workmen without divine directions....</p>
      <p>Whatever burdens lay heavily, cast them on the Lord. He that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. Repose
          in God. He is kept in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on God.</p>
      <p>At times it will seem that you cannot take another step. Well, wait and know that “I am God.” “Be strong and of
          a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
          goest.” ... We need to cherish faith.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>You must learn the simple art of taking God at His word; then you have solid ground beneath your feet.</p>
