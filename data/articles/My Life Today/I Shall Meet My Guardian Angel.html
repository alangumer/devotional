      <p><strong>All Life´s Expiriences Will Be Made Plain</strong></p>
      <p>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do
          always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 18:10</p>
      <p>Not until the providences of God are seen in the light of eternity shall we understand what we owe to the care
          and interposition of His angels. Celestial beings have taken an active part in the affairs of men. They have
          appeared in garments that shone as the lightning; they have come as men, in the garb of wayfarers. They have
          accepted the hospitalities of human homes; they have acted as guides to benighted travelers. They have
          thwarted the spoiler’s purpose, and turned aside the stroke of the destroyer.</p>
      <p>Though the rulers of this world know it not, yet often in their councils angels have been spokesmen. Human eyes
          have looked upon them. Human ears have listened to their appeals. In the council hall and the court of justice
          heavenly messengers have pleaded the cause of the persecuted and oppressed. They have defeated purposes and
          arrested evils that would have brought wrong and suffering to God’s children....</p>
      <p>Every redeemed one will understand the ministry of angels in his own life. The angel who was his guardian from
          his earliest moment; the angel who watched his steps, and covered his head in the day of peril; the angel who
          was with him in the valley of the shadow of death; who marked his resting place, who was the ﬁrst to greet him
          in the resurrection <nobr>morning–what</nobr> will it be to hold converse with him, and to learn the history
          of divine interposition in the individual life, of heavenly cooperation in every work for humanity!</p>
      <p>All the perplexities of life’s experience will then be made plain. Where to us have appeared only confusion and
          disappointment, broken purposes and thwarted plans, will be seen a grand, overruling, victorious purpose, a
          divine harmony.</p>
