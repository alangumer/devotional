      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>He that doeth good is of God. 3 John 11</p>
      <p>There are many ways in which the youth can be putting to usury the talents entrusted to them of God, to build
          up the work and cause of God, not to please themselves but to glorify God. The Majesty of heaven, the King of
          glory, made the inﬁnite sacriﬁce in coming to our world in order that He might elevate and ennoble
          humanity.... We read, “He went about doing good.” ...</p>
      <p>He has a vineyard in which everyone can perform good work. Suffering humanity needs help everywhere. The
          students may win their way to hearts by speaking words in season, by doing favors for those who need even
          physical labor. This will not degrade any of you, but it will bring a consciousness of the approval of God. It
          will be putting the talents entrusted to you for wise improvement to the exchangers. It will increase them by
          trading upon them....</p>
      <p>It is our duty ever to seek to do good in the use of the muscles and brain God has given to youth, that they
          may be useful to others, making their labors lighter, soothing the sorrowing, lifting up the discouraged,
          speaking words of comfort to the hopeless, turning the minds of the students from fun and frolic which often
          carries them beyond the dignity of manhood and womanhood to shame and disgrace. The Lord would have the mind
          elevated, seeking higher, nobler channels of usefulness.</p>
      <p>The true man is one who is willing to sacriﬁce his own interest for the good of others, and who exercises
          himself in binding up the brokenhearted.</p>
      <p>All power to do good is <nobr>God-given....</nobr> To God belongs all the glory for the</p>
      <p>wise and good deeds of human agents.</p>
