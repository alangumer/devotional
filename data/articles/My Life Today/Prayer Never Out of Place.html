      <p><strong>Prayer in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving. Colossians</p>
      <p>4:2</p>
      <p>There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up a petition to God. There is nothing that can
          prevent us from lifting up our hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the
          midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God, and plead for divine guidance.</p>
      <p>We may speak with Jesus as we walk by the way, and He says, I am at thy right hand. We may commune with God in
          our hearts; we may walk in companionship with Christ. When engaged in our daily labor, we may breathe out our
          heart’s desire, inaudible to any human ear; but that word cannot die away into silence, nor can it be lost.
          Nothing can drown the soul’s desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery. It is
          God to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard.</p>
      <p>Every earnest petition for grace and strength will be answered.... Ask God to</p>
      <p>do for you those things that you cannot do for yourselves. Tell Jesus everything. Lay open before Him the
          secrets of your heart; for His eye searches the inmost recesses of the soul, and He reads your thoughts as an
          open book. When you have asked for the things that are necessary for your soul’s good, believe that you
          receive them, and you shall have them. Accept His gifts with your whole heart; for Jesus has died that you
          might have the precious things of heaven as your own, and at last ﬁnd a home with the heavenly angels in the
          kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>If you will ﬁnd voice and time to pray, God will ﬁnd time and voice to answer.</p>
