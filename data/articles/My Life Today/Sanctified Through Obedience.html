    <h1>Sanctiﬁed Through Obedience</h1>

      <p><strong>Sanctiﬁcation</strong></p>
      <p>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your God. And ye shall keep my statutes, and
          do them: I am the Lord which sanctify you. Leviticus 20:7, 8</p>
      <p>Adam and Eve dared to transgress the Lord’s requirements, and the terrible result of their sin should be a
          warning to us not to follow their example of disobedience....There is no genuine sanctiﬁcation except through
          obedience to</p>
      <p>the truth. Those who love God with all the heart will love all His commandments also. The sanctiﬁed heart is in
          harmony with the precepts of God’s law; for they are holy, just, and good.</p>
      <p>No one who truly loves and fears God will continue to transgress the law in any particular. When man
          transgresses he is under the condemnation of the law, and it becomes to him a yoke of bondage. Whatever his
          profession may be he is not justiﬁed, which means pardoned.</p>
      <p>“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” Through obedience comes sanctiﬁcation of body, soul, and
          spirit. This sanctiﬁcation is a progressive work, and an advance from one stage of perfection to another.</p>
      <p>Let a living faith run like threads of gold through the performance of even the smallest duties. Then all the
          daily work will promote Christian growth. There will be a continual looking unto Jesus. Love for Him will give
          vital force to everything that is undertaken. Thus through the right use of our talents we may link ourselves
          by a golden chain to the higher world. This is true sanctiﬁcation, for sanctiﬁcation consists in the cheerful
          performance of daily duties in perfect obedience to the will of God.</p>
      <p>When it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put forth to this end, Jesus accepts this disposition and
          effort as man’s best service, and He makes up for the deﬁciency with His own divine merit.</p>
