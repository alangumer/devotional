    <h1>God Cares for Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help
          thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Isaiah 41:10</p>
      <p>The Lord is in active communication with every part of His vast dominions. He is represented as bending toward
          the earth and its inhabitants. He is listening to every word that is uttered. He hears every groan; He listens
          to every prayer; He observes the movements of every one....</p>
      <p>God has always had a care for His people.... Christ taught His disciples that</p>
      <p>the amount of divine attention given to any object is proportionate to the rank assigned to it in the creation
          of God. He called their attention to the birds of the air. Not a sparrow, He said, falls to the ground without
          the notice of our heavenly Father. And if the little sparrow is regarded by Him, surely the souls of those for
          whom Christ has died are precious in His sight. The value of man, the estimate God places upon him, is
          revealed in the cross of Calvary....</p>
      <p>God’s mercy and love for the fallen race have not ceased to accumulate, nor lost their earthward
          direction.</p>
      <p>It is true that disappointments will come; tribulation we must expect; but we are to commit everything, great
          and small, to God. He does not become perplexed by the multiplicity of our grievances, nor overpowered by the
          weight of our burdens. His watchcare extends to every household, and encircles every individual; He is
          concerned in all our business and our sorrows. He marks every tear; He is touched with the feeling of our
          inﬁrmities. All the afﬂictions and trials that befall us here are permitted, to work out His purposes of love
          toward <nobr>us–“that</nobr> we might be partakers of His holiness,” and thus become participants in that
          fullness of joy which is found in His presence.</p>
