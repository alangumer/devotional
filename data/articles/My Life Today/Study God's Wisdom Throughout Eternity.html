    <h1>Study God’s Wisdom Throughout Eternity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Activities in Heaven</strong></p>
      <p>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
          the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened. Ephesians 1:17, 18</p>
      <p>The science of redemption is the science of all sciences, the science that is the study of the angels and of
          all the intelligences of the unfallen worlds, the science that engages the attention of our Lord and Saviour,
          the science that enters into the purpose brooded in the mind of the <nobr>Inﬁnite–“kept</nobr> in silence
          through times eternal,” the science that will be the study of God’s redeemed throughout the endless ages. This
          is the highest study in which it is possible for man to engage. As no other study can, it will quicken the
          mind and uplift the soul....</p>
      <p>The theme of redemption is one that angels desire to look into; it will be the science and the song of the
          redeemed throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. Is it not worthy of careful thought and study now?
          ...</p>
      <p>The subject is inexhaustible. The study of the incarnation of Christ, His atoning sacriﬁce, and mediatorial
          work will employ the mind of the diligent student as long as time shall last; and looking to heaven with its
          unnumbered years, he will exclaim, “Great is the mystery of godliness.”</p>
      <p>In eternity we shall learn that which, had we received the enlightenment that it was possible to obtain here,
          would have opened our understanding. The themes of redemption will employ the hearts and minds and tongues of
          the redeemed through the everlasting ages. They will understand the truths which Christ longed to open to His
          disciples, but which they did not have faith to grasp. Forever and forever new views of the perfection and
          glory of Christ will appear. Through endless ages the faithful Householder will bring forth from His treasures
          things new and old.</p>
      <p>Since God is inﬁnite, and in Him are all the treasures of wisdom, we may to all eternity be ever searching,
          ever learning, yet never exhaust the riches of His wisdom, His goodness, or His power.</p>
