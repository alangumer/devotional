      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</p>
      <p>... for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. Luke 14:13,
          14</p>
      <p>God is displeased with the selﬁsh interest so often manifested for “me and my family.” Every family that
          cherishes this spirit needs to be converted by the pure principles exempliﬁed in the life of Christ. Those who
          shut themselves up within themselves, who are unwilling to be drawn upon to entertain visitors, lose many
          blessings.</p>
      <p>There are many others to whom we might make our homes a blessing. Our social entertainments should not be
          governed by the dictates of worldly custom, but by the Spirit of Christ and the teaching of His Word. The
          Israelites, in all their festivities, included the poor, the stranger, and the Levite, who was both the
          assistant of the priest in the sanctuary and a religious teacher and missionary. These were regarded as the
          guests of the people, to share their hospitality on all occasions of social and religious rejoicing and to be
          tenderly cared for in sickness or in need. It is such as these whom we should make welcome to our homes. How
          much such a welcome might do to cheer and encourage the missionary nurse or the teacher, the
          <nobr>care-burdened,</nobr><nobr>hard-working</nobr> mother, or the feeble and aged, so often without a home,
          and struggling with poverty and many discouragements....</p>
      <p>The warmth of a genial welcome, a place at your ﬁreside, a seat at your home table, the privilege of sharing
          the blessing of the hour of prayer, would to many of these be like a glimpse of heaven.</p>
      <p>Our sympathies are to overﬂow the boundaries of self and the enclosure of family walls. There are precious
          opportunities for those who will make their homes a blessing to others. Social inﬂuence is a wonderful power.
          We can use it if we will as a means of helping those about us....</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Our time here is short. We can pass through this world but once; as we pass along, let us make the most of
          life.</p>
