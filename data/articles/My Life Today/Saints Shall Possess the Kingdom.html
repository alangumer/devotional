    <h1>Saints Shall Possess the Kingdom</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Perfection of Character</strong></p>
      <p>The saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
          Daniel 7:18</p>
      <p>God takes none to heaven but those who are ﬁrst made saints in this world through the grace of Christ, those in
          whom He can see Christ exempliﬁed. When the love of Christ is an abiding principle in the soul, we shall
          realize that we are hid with Christ in God....</p>
      <p>These only who, by prayer and watchfulness and love, work the works of Christ, can God rejoice over with
          singing. The more fully the Lord sees the character of His beloved Son revealed in His people, the greater is
          His satisfaction and delight in them. God Himself and the heavenly angels rejoice over them with singing. The
          believing sinner is pronounced innocent, while the guilt is placed on Christ. The righteousness of Christ is
          placed on the debtor’s account, and against his name on the balance sheet is written: Pardoned. Eternal
          Life....</p>
      <p>“Ye are God’s husbandry.” As one takes pleasure in the cultivation of a garden, so God takes pleasure in His
          believing sons and daughters. A garden demands constant labor. The weeds must be removed; new plants must be
          set out; branches that are making too rapid development must be pruned back. So the Lord works for His garden,
          so He tends His plants. He cannot take pleasure in any development that does not reveal the graces of the
          character of Christ. The blood of Christ has made men and women God’s precious charge.... Some plants are
          so</p>
      <p>feeble that they have hardly any life, and for these the Lord has a special care.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Only those will enter heaven who in probationary time have formed a character that breathes a heavenly
          inﬂuence. The saint in heaven must ﬁrst be a saint upon earth.</p>
