      <p><strong>Social to Save</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him
          that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. Isaiah 50:4</p>
      <p>If we have Christ abiding with us, we shall be Christians at home as well as abroad. He who is a Christian will
          have kind words for his relatives and associates. He will be kind, courteous, loving, sympathetic, and will be
          educating himself for an abode with the family above. If he is a member of the royal family, he will represent
          the kingdom to which he is going. He will speak with gentleness to his children, for he will realize that they
          too are heirs of God, members of the heavenly court. Among the children of God no spirit of harshness
          dwells.</p>
      <p>Some pride themselves on being outspoken, blunt, and rough, and they call this frankness; but it is not rightly
          named, it is selﬁshness of the deepest dye.</p>
      <p>Christ is always calm and digniﬁed, and those who labor with Him will use in their work the oil of grace. Their
          words and actions will be soothing.</p>
      <p>We must educate the soul to be pitiful, gentle, tender, full of forgiveness and compassion. While we lay aside
          all vanity, all foolish talking, jesting, and joking, we are not to become cold, unsympathetic, and unsocial.
          The Spirit of the Lord is to rest upon you until you shall be like a fragrant ﬂower from the garden of God.
          You are to keep talking of the light, of Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, until you shall change from glory to
          glory, from character to character, going on from strength to strength, and reﬂecting more and more of the
          precious image of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Christ is ever ready to impart of His riches, and we should gather the jewels that come from Him, that, when we
          speak, these jewels may drop from our lips.</p>
