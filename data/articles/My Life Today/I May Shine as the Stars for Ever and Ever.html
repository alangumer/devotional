      <p><strong>Rewards of Service</strong></p>
      <p>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the ﬁrmament; and they that turn many to righteousness
          as the stars for ever and ever. Daniel 12:3</p>
      <p>He who has appointed “to every man his work,” according to his ability, will never let the faithful performance
          of duty go unrewarded. Every act of loyalty and faith will be crowned with special tokens of God’s favor and
          approbation. To every worker is given the promise: “He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
          shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.”</p>
      <p>However short our service or humble our work, if in simple faith we follow Christ, we shall not be disappointed
          of the reward. That which even the greatest and wisest cannot earn, the weakest and most humble may receive.
          Heaven’s golden gate opens not to the <nobr>self-exalted.</nobr> It is not lifted up to the proud in spirit.
          But the everlasting portals will open wide to the trembling touch of a little child. Blessed will be the
          recompense of grace to those who have wrought for God in the simplicity of faith and love.</p>
      <p>The brows of those who do this work will wear the crown of sacriﬁce. But they will receive their reward.</p>
      <p>To every worker for God this thought should be a stimulus and an encouragement. In this life our work for God
          often seems to be almost fruitless. Our efforts to do good may be earnest and persevering, yet we may not be
          permitted to witness their results. To us the effort may seem to be lost. But the Saviour assures us that our
          work is noted in heaven, and that the recompense cannot fail.</p>
      <p>Though his life may be hard and <nobr>self-denying,...in</nobr> the sight of heaven it will be a success, and
          he will be ranked as one of God’s noblemen. “They that be wise shall shine as the brightest of the ﬁrmament;
          and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.”</p>
