      <p>He that followeth after righteousness and mercy ﬁndeth life, righteousness, and honour. Proverbs 21:21</p>
      <p>Gatherings for social intercourse are made in the highest degree proﬁtable and instructive when those who meet
          together have the love of God glowing in their hearts; when they meet to exchange thoughts in regard to the
          Word of God or to consider methods for advancing His work and doing good to their fellow men. When the Holy
          Spirit is regarded as a welcome guest at these gatherings, when nothing is said or done to grieve it away, God
          is honored, and those who meet together are refreshed and strengthened....</p>
      <p>Christ rejoices when the thoughts of the young are occupied by the grand and ennobling themes of salvation. He
          enters the hearts of all such as an abiding guest, ﬁlling them with joy and peace.... Those who possess this
          love will delight to talk</p>
      <p>of the things that God has prepared for them that love Him.</p>
      <p>Young men and young women should not think that their sports, their evening parties, and musical
          entertainments, as usually conducted, are acceptable to Christ.</p>
      <p>Light has been given me, again and again, that all our gatherings should be characterized by a decided
          religious inﬂuence. If our young people would assemble to read and understand the Scriptures, asking, “What
          shall I do that I may have eternal life?” and then place themselves unitedly upon the side of truth, the Lord
          would let His blessing come into their hearts....</p>
      <p>To all, old and young, the word of the Lord is: Let the truth of God be inwrought in mind and soul. Let your
          prayer be, “O Lord, preserve my soul, that I shall not dishonor Thee.”</p>
