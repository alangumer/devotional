    <h1>Walk Not in the Way With Sinners</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Recreation and Amusements</strong></p>
      <p>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.... My son, walk not thou</p>
      <p>in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path. Proverbs <nobr>1:10-15</nobr> Amusements are doing more
          to counteract the working of the Holy Spirit than</p>
      <p>anything else, and the Lord is grieved.</p>
      <p>Those who are artiﬁcial in character and religious experience too readily gather for pleasure and amusement,
          and their inﬂuence attracts others. Sometimes young men and women who are trying to be Bible Christians are
          persuaded to join the party. Unwilling to be thought singular, and naturally inclined to follow the example of
          others, they place themselves under the inﬂuence of those who, perhaps, have never felt the divine touch on
          mind and heart. Had they prayerfully consulted the divine standard, to learn what Christ has said in regard to
          the fruit to be borne on the Christian tree, they would have discerned that these entertainments were really
          banquets prepared to keep souls from accepting the invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>
      <p>It sometimes happens that by frequenting places of amusement, youth who have been carefully instructed in the
          way of the Lord are carried away by the glamor of human inﬂuence, and form attachments for those whose
          education and training have been of a worldly character. They sell themselves into lifelong bondage by uniting
          with persons who have not the ornament of a Christlike spirit.</p>
      <p>You will be invited to attend places of amusement.... If you are true to Christ</p>
      <p>then, you will not try to form excuses for your nonattendance, but will plainly and modestly declare that you
          are a child of God, and your principles would not allow you to be in a place, even for one occasion, where you
          could not invite the presence of your Lord.</p>
      <p>God desires His people to show by their lives the advantage of Christianity over worldliness; to show that they
          are working on a high, holy plane.</p>
