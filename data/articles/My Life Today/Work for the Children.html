      <p><strong>Walking Where Jesus Walked</strong></p>
      <p>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of
          heaven. Matthew 19:14</p>
      <p>Wherever the Saviour went, the benignity of His countenance and His gentle, kindly manner won the love and
          conﬁdence of children....</p>
      <p>One mother with her child had left her home to ﬁnd Jesus. On the way she told a neighbor her errand, and the
          neighbor wanted to have Jesus bless her children. Thus several mothers came together, with their little ones.
          Some of the children had passed beyond the years of infancy to childhood and youth.... But He waited</p>
      <p>to see how the disciples would treat them. When He saw them send the mothers away, thinking to do Him a favor,
          He showed them their error, saying, “Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not; for of
          such is the kingdom of God.” He took the children in His arms, He laid His hands upon them, and gave them the
          blessing for which they came.</p>
      <p>God wants every child of tender age to be His child, to be adopted into His family. Young though they may be,
          the youth may be members of the household of faith, and have a most precious experience.... Christ will make
          them little</p>
      <p>missionaries. The whole current of their thoughts may be changed, so that sin will not appear a thing to be
          enjoyed but to be hated and shunned.... The Lord</p>
      <p>will give an experience to these children in missionary lines.</p>
      <p>We may bring hundreds and thousands of children to Christ if we will work for them.</p>
      <p>The children should be so educated that they will sympathize with the aged and afﬂicted and will seek to
          alleviate the sufferings of the poor and distressed. They should be taught to be diligent in missionary work;
          and from their earliest years <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and sacriﬁce for the good of others and the advancement
          of Christ’s cause should be inculcated, that they may be laborers together with God.</p>
