      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord....
          Greatly desiring to see thee, ... that</p>
      <p>I may be ﬁlled with joy. 2 Timothy <nobr>1:2-4</nobr></p>
      <p>From the judgment hall of Caesar, Paul returned to his cell, realizing that he had gained for himself only a
          brief respite. He knew that his enemies would not rest until they had compassed his death. But he knew also
          that for a time truth had triumphed....</p>
      <p>Sitting day after day in his gloomy cell, knowing that at a word or a nod from Nero his life might be
          sacriﬁced, Paul thought of Timothy, and determined to send for him. To Timothy had been committed the care of
          the church at Ephesus, and he had therefore been left behind when Paul made his last journey to Rome. Paul and
          Timothy were bound together by an affection unusually deep and strong. Since his conversion Timothy had shared
          Paul’s labors and sufferings, and the friendship between the two had grown stronger, deeper, and more sacred,
          until all that a son could be to a loved and honored father, Timothy was to the aged, <nobr>toil-worn</nobr>
          apostle. It is little wonder that in his loneliness and solitude Paul longed to see him.</p>
      <p>Under the most favorable circumstances several months must pass before Timothy could reach Rome from Asia
          Minor. Paul knew that his life was uncertain, and he feared that Timothy might arrive too late to see him. He
          had important counsel and instruction for the young man, to whom so great responsibility had been entrusted;
          and while urging him to come without delay, he dictated the dying testimony that he might not be spared to
          utter. His soul ﬁlled with loving solicitude for his son in the gospel and for the church under his care, Paul
          sought to impress Timothy with the importance of ﬁdelity to his sacred trust.... Paul closed his letter by
          commending his beloved Timothy to the</p>
      <p>guardianship of the Chief Shepherd, who, though the undershepherds might be stricken down, would still care for
          His ﬂock.</p>
