      <p><strong>Enduring Trials</strong></p>
      <p>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the ﬁery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing
          happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory
          shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. 1 Peter 4:12, 13</p>
      <p>One evening a gentleman who was much depressed because of deep afﬂiction was walking in a garden, where he
          observed a pomegranate tree nearly cut through the stem. Greatly wondering, he asked the gardener why the tree
          was in this condition, and he received an answer that explained to his satisfaction the wounds of his own
          bleeding heart. “Sir,” said the gardener, “this tree used to shoot out so strong that it bore nothing but
          leaves. I was obliged to cut it in this manner; and when it was almost cut through, it began to bear
          fruit.”</p>
      <p>Our sorrows do not spring out of the ground. In every afﬂiction God has a purpose to work out for our good.
          Every blow that destroys an idol, every providence that weakens our hold upon earth and fastens our affections
          more ﬁrmly upon God, is a blessing. The pruning may be painful for a time, but afterward it “yieldeth the
          peaceable fruit of righteousness.” We should receive with gratitude whatever will quicken the conscience,
          elevate the thoughts, and ennoble the life. The fruitless branches are cut off and cast into the ﬁre. Let us
          be thankful that through painful pruning we may retain a connection with the living Vine; for if we suffer
          with Christ, we shall also reign with Him. The very trial that taxes our faith the most severely and makes it
          seem as though God had forsaken us is to lead us more closely to Him, that we may lay all our burdens at the
          feet of Christ and experience the peace which He will give us in exchange.... God loves</p>
      <p>and cares for the feeblest of His creatures, and we cannot dishonor Him more than by doubting His love to us. O
          let us cultivate that living faith that will trust Him in the hour of darkness and trial!</p>
