      <p><strong>Victory in the Conﬂict</strong></p>
      <p>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus....</p>
      <p>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 2 Timothy <nobr>2:1-3</nobr></p>
      <p>In all that pertains to the success of God’s work, the very ﬁrst victories are to be won in the home life.</p>
      <p>Beyond the discipline of the home and the school, all have to meet the stern discipline of life. How to meet
          this wisely is a lesson that should be made plain to every child and to every youth. It is true that God loves
          us, that He is working for our happiness, and that, if His law had always been obeyed, we should never have
          known suffering; and it is no less true that, in this world, as the result of sin, suffering, trouble,
          burdens, come to every life. We may do the children and the youth a lifelong good by teaching them to meet
          bravely these troubles and burdens. While we should give them sympathy, let it never be such as to foster
          <nobr>self-pity.</nobr> What they need is that which stimulates and strengthens rather than weakens.</p>
      <p>They should be taught that this world is not a parade ground, but a battleﬁeld. All are called to endure
          hardness, as good soldiers. They are to be strong, and quit themselves like men. Let them be taught that the
          true test of character is found in the willingness to bear burdens, to take the hard place, to do the work
          that needs to be done, though it bring no earthly recognition or reward.</p>
      <p>There is no greater curse upon households than to allow the youth to have their own way.</p>
      <p>Temptation once resisted will give power to more ﬁrmly resist the second time; every new victory gained over
          self will smooth the way for higher and nobler triumphs. Every victory is a seed sown to eternal life.</p>
