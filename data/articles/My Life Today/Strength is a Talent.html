    <h1>Strength is a Talent</h1>

      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. Proverbs 24:5</p>
      <p>We are to love God, not only with all the heart, mind, and soul, but with all the strength. This covers the
          full, intelligent use of the physical powers....</p>
      <p>It was Christ who planned ... every speciﬁcation in regard to the building of Solomon’s temple. The One who in
          His earthly life worked as a carpenter in the village of Nazareth was the heavenly architect who marked out
          the plan for the sacred building where His name was to be honored....</p>
      <p>All right inventions and improvements have their source in Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
          working. The skillful touch of the physician’s hand, his power over nerve and muscle, his knowledge of the
          delicate organism of the body, is the wisdom of divine power, to be used in behalf of the suffering. The skill
          with which the carpenter uses the hammer, the strength with which the blacksmith makes the anvil ring, comes
          from God. He has entrusted men with talents, and He expects them to look to Him for counsel....</p>
      <p>Bible religion is to be interwoven with all we do or say.... They are to be</p>
      <p>united in all human pursuits, in mechanical and agricultural labors, in mercantile and scientiﬁc
          enterprises.... It is just as essential to do the will of God when</p>
      <p>erecting a building as when taking part in a religious service....</p>
      <p>Of Daniel we learn that in all his business transactions, when subjected to the closest scrutiny, not one fault
          or error could be found. He was a sample of what every businessman may be. His history shows what may be
          accomplished by one who consecrates the strength of brain and bone and muscle, of heart and life, to the
          service of God.</p>
