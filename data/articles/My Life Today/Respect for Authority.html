      <p><strong>Respect in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. Servants, be subject to your masters with all
          fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the forward. 1 Peter 2:17, 18</p>
      <p>The apostle plainly outlined the attitude that believers should sustain toward the civil authorities: “Submit
          yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto
          governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that
          do well. For so is the will of God, that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as
          free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. Honour all men.
          Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
      <p>It is our duty in every case to obey the laws of our land, unless they conﬂict with the higher law which God
          spoke with an audible voice from Sinai and afterward engraved on stone with His own ﬁnger.... The ten precepts
          of Jehovah</p>
      <p>are the foundation of all righteous and good laws. Those who love God’s commandments will conform to every good
          law of the land.</p>
      <p>We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine appointment and teach obedience to it as a
          sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conﬂict with the claims of God, we must obey
          God rather than men. God’s Word must be recognized as above all human legislation. A “Thus saith the Lord” is
          not to be set aside for a “Thus saith the church” or a “Thus saith the state.” The crown of Christ is to be
          lifted above the diadems of earthly potentates.</p>
      <p>We are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether spoken or written, should be carefully
          considered.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Teach the people to conform in all things to the laws of their state when they can do so without conﬂicting
          with the law of God.</p>
