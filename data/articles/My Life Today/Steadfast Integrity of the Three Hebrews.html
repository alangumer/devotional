    <h1>Steadfast Integrity of the Three Hebrews</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Examples of Sanctiﬁed Lives</strong></p>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar ... said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the ﬁre? They
          answered and said ... , True, O king. He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of
          the ﬁre, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. Daniel 3:24, 25</p>
      <p>These three Hebrews possessed genuine sanctiﬁcation. True Christian principle will not stop to weigh
          consequences. It does not ask, What will people think of me if I do this? or how will it affect my worldly
          prospects if I do that? With the most intense longing the children of God desire to know what He would have
          them do, that their works may glorify Him. The Lord has made ample provision that the hearts and lives of all
          His followers may be controlled by divine grace, that they may be as burning and shining lights in the
          world.</p>
      <p>These faithful Hebrews possessed great natural ability; they had enjoyed the highest intellectual culture, and
          now occupied a position of honor; but all this did not lead them to forget God. Their powers were yielded to
          the sanctifying inﬂuence of divine grace. By their steadfast integrity they showed forth the praises of Him
          who had called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. In their wonderful deliverance were displayed,
          before that vast assembly, the power and majesty of God. Jesus placed Himself by their side in the ﬁery
          furnace, and by the glory of His presence convinced the proud king of Babylon that it could be no other than
          the Son of God. The light of Heaven had been shining forth from Daniel and his companions, until all their
          associates understood the faith which ennobled their lives and beautiﬁed their characters....</p>
      <p>What a lesson is here given to the fainthearted, the vacillating, the cowardly in the cause of God! ... These
          faithful, steadfast characters exemplify sanctiﬁcation, while they have no thought of claiming the high
          honor.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Every Christian may enjoy the blessing of sanctiﬁcation.</p>
