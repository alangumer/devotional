    <h1>Loins Girt About with Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Equipped for Victory</strong></p>
      <p>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having
          done all, to stand, Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth. Ephesians 6:13, 14</p>
      <p>It is when we walk in the light that shines upon us, obeying the truth that is open to our understanding, that
          we receive greater light. We cannot be excusable in accepting only the light which our fathers had one hundred
          years ago.... We</p>
      <p>want the truth on every point, and we are to put it in practice daily.</p>
      <p>The whole mind and soul should become imbued with the truth, that you may be a living representation of
          Christ.... God would have you ﬁlled with His Holy</p>
      <p>Spirit, endowed with power from on high. Labor not to become great men; but labor rather to become good and
          perfect men, showing forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
          God calls for Calebs and Joshuas, fearless, singlehearted men, who will work with faith and courage.</p>
      <p>If the truth of God be not deep rooted in the heart, you cannot stand the test of temptation. There is only one
          power that can keep us steadfast under the most trying <nobr>circumstances–the</nobr> grace of God in truth.
          The ungodly are <nobr>lynx-eyed</nobr> to mark every inconsistency, and prompt to pour contempt on the weak
          and halting ones. Let the youth make their mark high. Let them seek in humble prayer for that help which
          Christ has promised, that they may exert an inﬂuence upon others that they will not be ashamed to meet in the
          great day of ﬁnal settlement and rewards. Those who have exempliﬁed the loftiest Christian principles in every
          department of business and religious life will have the inexpressible advantage, for they will enter the
          Paradise of God as conquerors.</p>
