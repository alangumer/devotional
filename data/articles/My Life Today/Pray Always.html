      <p><strong>Prayer in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come
          to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. Luke 21:36</p>
      <p>Remember that He was often in prayer, and His life was constantly sustained by fresh inspirations of the Holy
          Spirit. Let your thoughts, your inner life, be such that you will not be ashamed to meet its record in the day
          of God.</p>
      <p>Heaven is not closed against the fervent prayers of the righteous. Elijah was a man subject to like passions as
          we are, yet the Lord heard, and in a most striking manner answered his petitions. The only reason for our lack
          of power with God is to be found in ourselves. If the inner life of many who profess the truth were presented
          before them, they would not claim to be Christians. They are not growing in grace. A hurried prayer is offered
          now and then, but there is no real communion with God.</p>
      <p>We must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the divine life. When the message of truth was ﬁrst
          proclaimed, how much we prayed. How often was the voice of intercession heard in the chamber, in the barn, in
          the orchard, or the grove. Frequently we spent hours in earnest prayer, two or three together claiming the
          promise; often the sound of weeping was heard and then the voice of thanksgiving and the song of praise. Now
          the day of God is nearer than when we ﬁrst believed, and we should be more earnest, more zealous, and fervent
          than in those early days. Our perils are greater now than then. Souls are more hardened. We need now to be
          imbued with the Spirit of Christ, and we should not rest until we receive it.</p>
      <p>Cultivate the habit of talking with the Saviour.... Let the heart be continually</p>
      <p>uplifted in silent petition for help, for light, for strength, for knowledge. Let every breath be a
          prayer.</p>
