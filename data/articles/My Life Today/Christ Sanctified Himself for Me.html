      <p><strong>Sanctiﬁcation</strong></p>
      <p>As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I
          sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctiﬁed through the truth. John 17:18, 19</p>
      <p>Christ declared He sanctiﬁed Himself, that we also might be sanctiﬁed. He took upon Himself our nature, and
          became a faultless pattern for men. He made no mistake, that we also might become victors, and enter into His
          kingdom as overcomers. He prayed that we might be sanctiﬁed through the truth. What is truth? He declared,
          “Thy word is truth.” His disciples were to be sanctiﬁed through obedience to the truth. He says, “Neither pray
          I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.” That prayer was for us; we
          have believed in the testimony of the disciples of Christ. He prays that His disciples may be one, even as He
          and the Father are one; and this unity of believers is to be as testimony to the world that He has sent us,
          and that we bear the evidence of His grace.</p>
      <p>We are to be brought into a sacred nearness with the world’s Redeemer. We are to be one with Christ as He is
          one with the Father. What a wonderful change the people of God experience in coming into unity with the Son of
          God! We are to have our tastes, inclinations, ambitions, and passions all subdued, and brought into harmony
          with the mind and spirit of Christ. This is the very work that the Lord is willing to do for those who believe
          in Him. Our life and deportment are to have a molding power in the world. The spirit of Christ is to have a
          controlling inﬂuence over the life of His followers, so that they will speak and act like Jesus. Christ says,
          “The glory which thou gavest Me I have given them.” ...</p>
      <p>The grace of Christ is to work a wonderful transformation in the life and character of its receiver; and if we
          are truly the disciples of Christ, the world will see that divine power has done something for us; for while
          we are in the world, we shall not be of it.</p>
