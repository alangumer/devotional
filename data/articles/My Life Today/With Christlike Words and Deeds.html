      <p><strong>I Too May Conquer</strong></p>
      <p>By thy words thou shalt be justiﬁed, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Matthew 12:37</p>
      <p>When you do your appointed work without contention or criticism of others, a freedom, a light, and a power will
          attend it that will give character and inﬂuence to the institutions and enterprises with which you are
          connected.</p>
      <p>Remember that you are never on vantage ground when you are rufﬂed and when you carry the burden of setting
          right every soul who comes near you. If you yield to the temptation to criticize others, to point out their
          faults, to tear down what they are doing, you may be sure that you will fail to act your own part nobly and
          well.</p>
      <p>This is a time when every man in a responsible position and every member of the church should bring every
          feature of his work into close accord with the teachings of the Word of God. By untiring vigilance, by fervent
          prayer, by Christlike words and deeds, we are to show the world what God desires His church to be....</p>
      <p>Christ humbled Himself to stand at the head of humanity, to meet the temptations and endure the trials that
          humanity must meet and endure. He must know what humanity has to meet from the fallen foe, that He might know
          how to succor those who are tempted.</p>
      <p>And Christ has been made our judge. The Father is not the judge. The angels are not. He who took humanity upon
          Himself, and in this world lived a perfect life, is to judge us. He only can be our judge.... No one of you
          has been appointed</p>
      <p>to be judge of others. It is all that you can do to discipline yourselves....</p>
      <p>We have a character to maintain, but it is the character of Christ.... May the</p>
      <p>Lord help us to die to self, and be born again, that Christ may live in us, a living, active principle, a power
          that will keep us holy.</p>
