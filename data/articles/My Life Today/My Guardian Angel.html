      <p>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. Psalm 91:11</p>
      <p>A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These heavenly watchers shield the righteous from
          the power of the wicked one. This Satan himself recognized when he said, “Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast
          not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?” The agency by
          which God protects His people is presented in the words of the psalmist, “The angel of the Lord encampeth
          round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.”</p>
      <p>I have seen the tender love that God has for His people, and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints
          with their wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel. If the saints wept through
          discouragement, or were in danger, the angels that ever attended them would ﬂy quickly upward to carry the
          tidings, and the angels in the city would cease to sing.... They would bear the tidings</p>
      <p>upward, and all the angels in the city would weep, and then with a loud voice say, “Amen.” But if the saints
          ﬁxed their eyes upon the prize before them, and gloriﬁed God by praising Him, then the angels would bear the
          glad tidings to the city, and the angels in the city would touch their golden harps and sing with a loud
          voice, “Alleluia!” and the heavenly arches would ring with their lovely songs.</p>
      <p>His angels are appointed to watch over us, and if we put ourselves under their guardianship, then in every time
          of danger they will be at our right hand. When unconsciously we are in danger of exerting a wrong inﬂuence,
          the angels will be by our side, prompting us to a better course, choosing words for us, and inﬂuencing our
          actions. Thus our inﬂuence may be a silent, unconscious, but mighty power in drawing others to Christ and the
          heavenly world.</p>
