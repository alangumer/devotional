      <p><strong>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>A good man obtaineth favour of the Lord. Proverbs 12:2</p>
      <p>True goodness is accounted of Heaven as true greatness. The condition of the moral affections determines the
          worth of the man. A person may have property and intellect, and yet be valueless, because the glowing ﬁre of
          goodness has never burned upon the altar of his heart.</p>
      <p>Goodness is the result of divine power transforming human nature. By believing in Christ, the fallen race he
          has redeemed may obtain that faith which works by love and puriﬁes the soul from all deﬁlement. Then
          Christlike attributes appear: for by beholding Christ men become changed into the same image from glory to
          glory, from character to character. Good fruit is produced. The character is fashioned after the divine
          similitude, and integrity, uprightness, and true benevolence are manifested toward the sinful race.</p>
      <p>The Lord has placed every human being on test and trial. He desires to prove and to try us, to see if we will
          be good and do good in this life, to see if he can trust us with eternal riches, and make us members of the
          royal family, children of the heavenly King.</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the good you may do. If you make the Word of God the rule of your life, and govern your
          actions by its precepts, making all your purposes and exertions in the fulﬁlling of your duty a blessing and
          not a curse to others, success will crown your efforts. You have placed yourself in connection with God; you
          have become a channel of light to others. You are honored by becoming <nobr>co-laborers</nobr> with Jesus; and
          no higher honor can you receive than the blessed benediction from the lips of the Saviour: “Well done, good
          and faithful servant.”</p>
