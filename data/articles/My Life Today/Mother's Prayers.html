      <p><strong>Prayer in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>For I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. Isaiah 49:25</p>
      <p>Those who keep the law of God look upon their children with indeﬁnable feelings of hope and fear, wondering
          what part they will act in the great conﬂict that is just before them. The anxious mother questions, “What
          stand will they take? What can I do to prepare them to act well their part, so that they will be the
          recipients of eternal glory?”</p>
      <p>Great responsibilities rest upon you, mothers.... You may aid them to develop</p>
      <p>characters that will not be swayed or inﬂuenced to do evil, but will sway and inﬂuence others to do right. By
          your fervent prayers of faith you can move the arm that moves the world....</p>
      <p>The prayers of Christian mothers are not disregarded by the Father of all....</p>
      <p>He will not turn away your petitions, and leave you and yours to the buffetings of Satan in the great day of
          ﬁnal conﬂict. It is for you to work with simplicity and faithfulness, and God will establish the work of your
          hands.</p>
      <p>The lifework performed on earth is acknowledged in the heavenly courts as a work well done. With joy
          unutterable, parents see the crown, the robe, the harp, given to their children.... The seed sown with tears
          and prayers may have seemed</p>
      <p>to be sown in vain, but their harvest is reaped with joy at last. Their children have been redeemed.</p>
      <p>When the “well done” of the great Judge is pronounced, and the crown of immortal glory is placed upon the brow
          of the victor, many will raise their crowns in sight of the assembled universe and, pointing to their mothers,
          say, “She made me all I am through the grace of God. Her instruction, her prayers, have been blessed to my
          eternal salvation.</p>
