      <p><strong>My Consecration Today</strong></p>
      <p>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacriﬁce, holy,
          acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Romans 12:1</p>
      <p>God calls for <nobr>whole-souled</nobr> consecration to His ways. Our highest powers are to be carefully
          cultivated. Our talents are lent us by God for use, not to be perverted or abused. They are to be improved by
          use, that they may do the work of God.</p>
      <p>We are to give ourselves to the service of God, and we should seek to make the offering as nearly perfect as
          possible. God will not be pleased with anything less than the best we can offer. Those who love Him with all
          the heart will desire to give Him the best service of the life, and they will be constantly seeking to bring
          every power of their being into harmony with the laws that will promote their ability to do His will.</p>
      <p>Personal consecration is necessary, and we cannot have this unless heart holiness is cultivated and
          cherished.</p>
      <p>Let your prayer be, “Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy
          service. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter.</p>
      <p>The surrender of all our powers to God greatly simpliﬁes the problem of life. It weakens and cuts short a
          thousand struggles with the passions of the natural heart. Religion is as a golden cord that binds the souls
          of both youth and aged to Christ. Through it the willing and obedient are brought safely through dark and
          intricate paths to the city of God....</p>
      <p>How many times have the deep things of God been unfolded before us, and how highly should we prize these
          precious privileges.... The bright beams of</p>
      <p>Heaven’s light are shining upon your pathway.... Receive and cherish every</p>
      <p><nobr>Heaven-sent</nobr> ray, and your path will grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.</p>
