      <p><strong>I Too May Conquer</strong></p>
      <p>A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. Proverbs 29:23</p>
      <p>Man may lift himself up in pride and boast of his power, but in an instant God can bring him to nothingness. It
          is Satan’s work to lead men to glorify themselves with their entrusted talents. Every man through whom God
          works will have to learn that the living, <nobr>ever-present,</nobr><nobr>ever-acting</nobr> God is supreme,
          and has lent him talents to <nobr>use–an</nobr> intellect to originate; a heart to be the seat of his throne;
          affections to ﬂow out in blessing to all with whom he shall come in contact, a conscience through which the
          Holy Spirit can convict him of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.</p>
      <p>Pride, ignorance, and folly are constant companions. The Lord is displeased with the pride manifested among His
          professed people.</p>
      <p>Parents, ... it is easier for you to teach your children a lesson of pride than a lesson of humility.</p>
      <p>Before honor is humility. To ﬁll a high place before men, Heaven chooses the worker who ... takes a lowly place
          before God. The most childlike disciple is the most efﬁcient in labor for God. The heavenly intelligences can
          cooperate with him who is seeking, not to exalt self, but to save souls.... From communion</p>
      <p>with Christ he will go forth to work for those who are perishing in their sins. He is anointed for his mission,
          and he succeeds where many of the learned and intellectually wise would fail....</p>
      <p>The simplicity, the <nobr>self-forgetfulness,</nobr> and the conﬁding love of a little child are the attributes
          that Heaven values. These are the characteristics of real greatness.</p>
      <p>Solomon was never so rich or so wise or so truly great as when he confessed, “I am but a little child: I know
          not how to go out or come in.”</p>
