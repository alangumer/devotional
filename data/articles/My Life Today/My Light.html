      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. Psalm 119:130</p>
      <p>It [the Word of God] is a light shining in a dark place. As we search its pages, light enters the heart,
          illuminating the mind. By this light we see what we ought to be.</p>
      <p>We see in the Word, warnings and promises, with God behind them all. We are invited to search this Word for aid
          when brought into difﬁcult places. If we do not consult the Guidebook at every step, inquiring, Is this the
          way of the Lord? our words and acts will be tainted by selﬁshness. We shall forget God, and walk in paths that
          He has not chosen for us.</p>
      <p>God’s Word is full of precious promises and helpful counsel. It is infallible; for God cannot err. It has help
          for every circumstance and condition of life, and God looks on with sadness when His children turn from it to
          human aid.</p>
      <p>He who through the Scriptures holds communion with God will be ennobled and sanctiﬁed. As he reads the inspired
          record of the Saviour’s love, his heart will melt in tenderness and contrition. He will be ﬁlled with a desire
          to be like his Master, to live a life of loving service.... By a miracle of His power He has</p>
      <p>preserved His Written Word through the ages.</p>
      <p>This book is God’s great director.... It ﬂashes its light ahead, that we may see</p>
      <p>the path by which we are traveling; and its rays are thrown back on past history, showing the most perfect
          harmony in that which, to the mind in darkness, appears like error and discord. In that which seems to the
          worldling an inexplicable mystery, God’s children see light and beauty.</p>
      <p>Happy is the man who has discovered for himself that the Word of God is a light to his feet and a lamp to his
          <nobr>path–a</nobr> light shining in a dark place. It is heaven’s directory for men.</p>
