      <p><strong>Highways to Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that he might
          preserve us alive, as it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
          commandments. Deuteronomy 6:24, 25</p>
      <p>Happiness must be sought in the right way and from the right source. Some think they may surely ﬁnd happiness
          in a course of indulgence in sinful pleasures or in deceptive worldly attractions. And some sacriﬁce physical
          and moral obligations, thinking to ﬁnd happiness, and they lose both soul and body. Others will seek their
          happiness in the indulgence of an unnatural appetite, and consider the indulgence of taste more desirable than
          health and life. Many suffer themselves to be enchained by sensual passions, and will sacriﬁce physical
          strength, intellect, and moral powers to the gratiﬁcation of lust. They will bring themselves to untimely
          graves, and in the judgment will be charged with <nobr>self-murder.</nobr></p>
      <p>Is this the happiness desirable which is to be found in the path of disobedience and transgression of physical
          and moral law? Christ’s life points out the true source of happiness and how it is to be attained.... If they
          would be happy indeed,</p>
      <p>they should cheerfully seek to be found at the post of duty, doing the work which devolves upon them with
          ﬁdelity, conforming their hearts and lives to the perfect pattern.</p>
      <p>Upon obedience depends life and happiness, health and joy, of men, women, and children. Obedience is for their
          <nobr>well-being</nobr> in this life and in the life to come.</p>
      <p>Where can we ﬁnd a surer guide than the only true God? ... Where is a safer path than that in which the Eternal
          leads the way? When we follow Him we are in no cheap, tangled bush path.</p>
      <p>The path of obedience to God is the path of virtue, of health, and happiness.</p>
