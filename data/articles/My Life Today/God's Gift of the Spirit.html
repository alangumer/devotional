      <p>God’s Gift of the Spirit</p>
      <p>Gifts of the Holy Spirit</p>
      <p>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even
          the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know
          him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. John 14:16, 17</p>
      <p>During the Jewish economy the inﬂuence of God’s Spirit had been seen in a marked manner, but not in full. For
          ages prayers had been offered for the fulﬁllment of God’s promise to impart His Spirit, and not one of these
          earnest supplications had been forgotten.</p>
      <p>Christ determined that when He ascended from this earth He would bestow a gift on those who had believed on Him
          and those who should believe on Him. What gift could He bestow rich enough to signalize and grace His
          ascension to the mediatorial throne? It must be worthy of His greatness and His royalty. He determined to give
          His representative, the third person of the Godhead. This gift could not be excelled. He would give all gifts
          in one, and therefore the divine Spirit, that converting, enlightening, and sanctifying power, would be His
          donation.... It came with a fullness and power, as if for ages it had been restrained,</p>
      <p>but was now being poured forth upon the church....</p>
      <p>Believers were reconverted. Sinners united with Christians seeking the pearl of great price.... Every Christian
          saw in his brother the divine similitude of</p>
      <p>benevolence and love. One interest prevailed. One object swallowed up all others. Every pulse beat in healthy
          concert. The only ambition of the believers was to see who could reveal most perfectly the likeness of
          Christ’s character, who could do the most for the enlargement of His kingdom.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit was sent as the most priceless treasure man could receive.</p>
