    <h1>Jesus and His Friends at Bethany</h1>

      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. John 11:5</p>
      <p>There was one home that He loved to <nobr>visit–the</nobr> home of Lazarus, and Mary, and Martha; for in the
          atmosphere of faith and love His spirit had rest.</p>
      <p>Among the most steadfast of Christ’s disciples was Lazarus of Bethany. From their ﬁrst meeting his faith in
          Christ had been strong; his love for Him was deep, and he was greatly beloved by the Saviour. It was for
          Lazarus that the greatest of Christ’s miracles was performed. The Saviour blessed all who sought His help; He
          loves all the human family; but to some He is bound by peculiarly tender associations. His heart was knit by a
          strong bond of affection to the family at Bethany, and for one of them His most wonderful work was
          wrought.</p>
      <p>At the home of Lazarus, Jesus had often found rest. The Saviour had no home of His own; He was dependent on the
          hospitality of His friends and disciples; and often, when weary, thirsting for human fellowship, He had been
          glad to escape to this peaceful household, away from the suspicion and jealousy of the angry Pharisees. Here
          He found a sincere welcome, a pure, holy friendship. Here He could speak with simplicity and perfect freedom,
          knowing that His words would be understood and treasured.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour appreciated a quiet home and interested listeners. He longed for human tenderness, courtesy, and
          affection. Those who received the heavenly instruction He was always ready to impart were greatly blessed....
          The multitudes</p>
      <p>were slow of hearing, and in the home at Bethany Christ found rest from the weary conﬂict of public life. Here
          He opened to an appreciative audience the volume of Providence. In these private interviews He unfolded to His
          hearers that which He did not attempt to tell to the mixed multitude. He needed not to speak to His friends in
          parables.</p>
