    <h1>Kindness the Mark of a Christian</h1>

      <p><strong>Emotional Maturity Brings Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. Proverbs 31:26</p>
      <p>Your inﬂuence reaches the soul; you touch not a wire but that vibrates back to God.... It is your duty to be
          Christians in the highest sense of the</p>
      <p><nobr>word–“Christlike.”</nobr> It is through the unseen lines that attract you to other minds with which you
          are brought in contact that may, if you are in constant connection with God, leave impressions that will make
          you a savor of life unto life. Otherwise, if you are selﬁsh, if you are <nobr>self-exalted,</nobr> if you are
          <nobr>worldly-minded,</nobr> no matter what your position, no matter what your experience has been, or how
          much you know, if you are not having the law of kindness on your lips, sweet fragrance of love springing from
          your heart, you can do nothing as it ought to be done.</p>
      <p>Kindness and love and courtesy are the marks of the Christian.... In our</p>
      <p>association with each other let it be ever remembered that there are chapters in the experience of others that
          are sealed from mortal eyes; there are sad histories that are written in the books of heaven but are sacredly
          guarded from prying eyes. There stand registered long, hard battles with trying circumstances, arising in the
          very homes, that day by day sap the courage, the faith, the conﬁdence, until the very manhood seems to fall to
          ruins. But Jesus knows it all, and He never forgets. To such, words of kindness and of affection are welcome
          as the smile of angels; a strong, helpful grasp of the hand of a true friend is worth more than gold and
          silver.</p>
      <p>The true, honest expression of a sister, or brother, or friend, given in genuine simplicity, has power to open
          the door of hearts which need the fragrance of Christlike words and the simple, delicate touch of the spirit
          of Christ’s love.</p>
