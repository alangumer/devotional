      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers. Malachi
          4:6</p>
      <p>The father when he returns from his daily labor will not bring his perplexities to his home. He will feel that
          home and the family circle are too sacred to be marred with unhappy perplexities. When he left his home he did
          not leave his Saviour and his religion behind. Both were his companions. The sweet inﬂuence of his home, the
          blessing of his wife, and the love of his children make his burdens light; and he returns with peace in his
          heart and cheerful, encouraging words for his wife and children, who are waiting joyfully to welcome his
          coming.</p>
      <p>He should ﬁnd it a pleasant change to spend some time with his children. He may take them into the garden and
          show them the opening buds and the varied tints of the blooming ﬂowers.... He may impress upon their minds
          the</p>
      <p>fact that if God cares so much for the trees and ﬂowers, he will care much more for the creatures formed in his
          image. He may lead them early to understand that God wants children to be lovely, not with artiﬁcial
          adornment, but with beauty of character, the charms of kindness and affection, which will make their hearts
          bound with joy and happiness.</p>
      <p>If the frivolous and pleasure seeking will allow their minds to dwell upon the real and the true, the heart
          cannot but be ﬁlled with reverence, and they will adore the God of nature.</p>
      <p>If you would draw your children to Jesus, you must not enter your home with cross words, with a frown upon your
          brow. If you come from your business weary and worn, just plead with God for His grace, for His restful
          Spirit, that your heart may be melted with tenderness, that your lips may be ﬁlled with words of kindness and
          comfort. Bind your children to your heart. Recommend your religion to them by its pleasantness.</p>
