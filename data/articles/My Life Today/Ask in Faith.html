      <p><strong>Faith in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
          tossed. James 1:6</p>
      <p>It is our privilege, our duty, to receive light from heaven, that we may perceive the wiles of Satan, and
          obtain strength to resist his power. Provision has been made for us to come into close connection with Christ
          and to enjoy the constant protection of the angels of God. Our faith must reach within the veil, where Jesus
          has entered for us. We must lay hold with ﬁrmer grasp on the unfailing promises of God. We must have faith
          that will not be denied, faith that will take hold of the unseen, faith that is steadfast, immovable. Such
          faith will bring the blessing of heaven to our souls. The light of the glory of God that shines in the face of
          Christ may shine upon us, and be reﬂected upon all around, so that it can be truly said of us, “Ye are the
          light of the world.” And it is this connection of the soul with Christ, and this alone, that can bring light
          to the world. Were it not for this connection, the earth would be left in utter darkness.... The deeper the
          surrounding gloom, the</p>
      <p>brighter should shine out the light of Christian faith and Christian example.</p>
      <p>The fact that unbelief prevails, that iniquity is increasing all around us, should not cause our faith to grow
          dim or our courage to waver.... If we will but seek God</p>
      <p>with all our hearts, if we will work with that same determined zeal, and believe with that unyielding faith,
          the light of heaven will shine upon us, even as it shone upon the devoted Enoch.</p>
      <p>Oh that I could impress upon all the importance of exercising faith moment by moment, and hour by hour! We are
          to live the life of faith; for “without faith it is impossible to please God.” Our spiritual strength depends
          upon our faith.</p>
