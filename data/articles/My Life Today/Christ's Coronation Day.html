    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ Redeems Me Unto Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.
          Revelation 15:3</p>
      <p>In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and His Son. The angels of heaven,
          touching their golden harps, will welcome the King, and those who are the trophies of His
          <nobr>victory–those</nobr> who have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph
          will peal forth, ﬁlling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts accompanied by His
          redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of suffering and sacriﬁce has not been in vain.</p>
      <p>Far above the city, upon a foundation of burnished gold, is a throne, high and lifted up. Upon this throne sits
          the Son of God, and around Him are the subjects of His kingdom. The power and majesty of Christ no language
          can describe, no pen portray. The glory of the Eternal Father is enshrouding His Son. The brightness of His
          presence ﬁlls the city of God and ﬂows out beyond the gates, ﬂooding the whole earth with its radiance.</p>
      <p>Nearest the throne are those who were once zealous in the cause of Satan, but who, plucked as brands from the
          burning, have followed their Saviour with deep, intense devotion. Next are those who perfected Christian
          characters in the midst of falsehood and inﬁdelity, those who honored the law of God when the Christian world
          declared it void, and the millions of all ages who were martyred for their faith. And beyond is the “great
          multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, ... before the
          throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.” Their warfare is ended,
          their victory won. They have run the race and reached the prize....</p>
      <p>In the presence of the assembled inhabitants of earth and heaven the ﬁnal coronation of the Son of God takes
          place.</p>
