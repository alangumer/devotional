      <p><strong>Elements of Good Health</strong></p>
      <p>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 3 John
          2</p>
      <p>The Saviour in His miracles revealed the power that is continually at work in man’s behalf to sustain and to
          heal him. Through the agencies of nature, God is working, day by day, hour by hour, moment by moment, to keep
          us alive, to build up and restore us. When any part of the body sustains injury, a healing process is at once
          begun; nature’s agencies are set at work to restore soundness. But the power working through these agencies is
          the power of God. All <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power is from Him. When one recovers from disease, it is God
          who restores him....</p>
      <p>The words spoken to Israel are true today of those who recover health of body or health of soul. “I am the Lord
          that healeth thee.”</p>
      <p>The desire of God for every human being is expressed in the words, “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou
          mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
      <p>Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine
          <nobr>power–these</nobr> are the true remedies.</p>
      <p>The things of nature are God’s blessings, provided to give health to body, mind, and soul. They are given to
          the well to keep them well and to the sick to make them well....</p>
      <p>Nature is God’s physician. The pure air, the glad sunshine, the beautiful ﬂowers and trees, the orchards and
          vineyards, and outdoor exercise amid these surroundings are health <nobr>giving–the</nobr> elixir of
          life.</p>
      <p>Nothing so tends to restore health and happiness as living amid attractive country surroundings.</p>
      <p>Life in the open air is good for body and mind. It is God’s medicine for the restoration of health.</p>

      <p>True religion and the laws of health go hand in hand.</p>
