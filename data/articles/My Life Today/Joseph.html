      <p><strong>Heroes for God</strong></p>
      <p>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we ﬁnd such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? And
          Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as
          thou art: thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the
          throne will I be greater than thou. Genesis <nobr>41:38-40</nobr></p>
      <p>From the dungeon Joseph was exalted to be ruler over all the land of Egypt. It was a position of high honor,
          yet it was beset with difﬁculty and peril. One cannot stand upon a lofty height without danger. As the tempest
          leaves unharmed the lowly ﬂower of the valley, while it uproots the stately tree upon the mountaintop, so
          those who have maintained their integrity in humble life may be dragged down to the pit by the temptations
          that assail worldly success and honor. But Joseph’s character bore the test alike of adversity and prosperity.
          The same ﬁdelity to God was manifested when he stood in the palace of the Pharaohs as when in a prisoner’s
          cell. He was still a stranger in a heathen land, separated from his kindred, the worshipers of God; but he
          fully believed that the divine hand had directed his steps, and in constant reliance upon God he faithfully
          discharged the duties of his position. Through Joseph the attention of the king and great men of Egypt was
          directed to the true God; and ... they learned to respect the principles revealed in the life and character of
          the worshiper of Jehovah.</p>
      <p>How was Joseph enabled to make such a record of ﬁrmness of character, uprightness, and <nobr>wisdom?–In</nobr>
          his early years he had consulted duty rather than inclination; and the integrity, the simple trust, the noble
          nature, of the youth, bore fruit in the deeds of the man.... Faithful attention to duty in every station, from
          the</p>
      <p>lowliest to the most exalted, had been training every power for its highest service. He who lives in accordance
          with the Creator’s will is securing to himself the truest and noblest development of character.</p>
