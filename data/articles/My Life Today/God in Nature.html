      <p><strong>God in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>The heavens declare the glory of God; and the ﬁrmament sheweth his handywork. Psalm 19:1</p>
      <p>God has surrounded us with nature’s beautiful scenery to attract and interest the mind. It is His design that
          we should associate the glories of nature with His character. If we faithfully study the book of nature, we
          shall ﬁnd it a fruitful source for contemplating the inﬁnite love and power of God....</p>
      <p>The great Master Artist has painted upon heaven’s shifting, changing canvas the glories of the setting sun. He
          has tinted and gilded the heavens with gold, silver, and crimson, as though the portals of high heaven were
          thrown open, that we might view its gleamings and our imagination take hold of the glory within. Many turn
          carelessly from this heavenly wrought picture. They fail to trace the inﬁnite love and power of God in the
          surpassing beauties seen in the heavens, but are almost entranced as they view the imperfect paintings, in
          imitation of the Master Artist.</p>
      <p>The Redeemer of the world chose the open air in which to give His lessons of instruction.... He chose the
          groves and the seaside, where He could have</p>
      <p>a commanding view of landscape and varied scenery, that He might illustrate important truths of the kingdom of
          God by the works of God in nature.</p>
      <p>Look at the wonderful and beautiful things of nature. Think of their marvelous adaptation to the needs and
          happiness, not only of man, but of all living creatures. The sunshine and the rain, that gladden and refresh
          the earth, the hills and seas and plains, all speak to us of the Creator’s love. It is God who brings the bud
          to bloom, the ﬂower to fruit. It is He who supplies the daily needs of all His creatures.</p>
      <p>The heart is quickened, and throbs with new and deeper love, mingled with awe and reverence, as we contemplate
          God in nature.</p>
