    <h1>Restore the Old Paths</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Saved to Serve</strong></p>
      <p>And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
          generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. Isaiah
          58:12</p>
      <p>The work speciﬁed in these words is the work God requires His people to do. It is a work of God’s own
          appointment. With the work of advocating the commandments of God and repairing the breach that has been made
          in the law of God, we are to mingle compassion for suffering humanity. We are to show supreme love to God; we
          are to exalt His memorial, which has been trodden down by unholy feet; and with this, we are to manifest
          mercy, benevolence, and the tenderest pity for the fallen race. “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” As
          a people we must take hold of this work. Love revealed for suffering humanity gives signiﬁcance and power to
          the truth.</p>
      <p>The evangelization of the world is the work that God has given to those who go forth in His name. They are to
          be <nobr>co-laborers</nobr> with Christ, revealing to those ready to perish His tender, pitying love. God
          calls for thousands to work for Him, not by preaching to those who know the truth, going over and over the
          same ground, but by warning those who have never heard the last message of mercy. Work, with a heart ﬁlled
          with an earnest longing for souls. Do medical missionary work. Thus you will gain access to the hearts of the
          people. The way will be prepared for more decided proclamation of the truth. You will ﬁnd that relieving their
          physical suffering gives you opportunity to minister to their spiritual needs.</p>
      <p>The Lord will give you success in this work; for the gospel is the power of God unto salvation when it is
          interwoven with the practical life, when it is lived and practiced. The union of Christlike work for the body
          and Christlike work for the soul is the true interpretation of the gospel.</p>
