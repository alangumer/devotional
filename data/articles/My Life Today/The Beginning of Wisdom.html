      <p><strong>Growing in Wisdom and Knowledge</strong></p>
      <p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. Proverbs
          9:10</p>
      <p>Christ was the greatest teacher the world ever saw. He brought to man knowledge direct from heaven. The lessons
          which He has given us are what we need for both the present and the future state. He sets before us the true
          aims of life and how we may secure them.</p>
      <p>In the school of Christ students are never graduated. Among the pupils are both old and young. Those who give
          heed to the instructions of the divine Teacher constantly advance in wisdom, reﬁnement, and nobility of soul,
          and thus they are prepared to enter that higher school where advancement will continue throughout
          eternity.</p>
      <p>Inﬁnite Wisdom sets before us the great lessons of <nobr>life–lessons</nobr> of duty and happiness. These are
          often hard to learn, but without them we can make no real progress. They may cost us effort and tears, and
          even agony, but we must not falter or grow weary. We shall at last hear the Master’s call, “Child, come up
          higher.” ...</p>
      <p>Every faculty, every attribute, with which the Creator has endowed the children of men is to be employed for
          His glory; and in this employment is found its purest, holiest, happiest exercise. While religious principle
          is held paramount, every advance step taken in the acquirement of knowledge or in the culture of the intellect
          is a step toward the assimilation of the human with the Divine, the ﬁnite with the Inﬁnite.</p>
      <p>If the youth will but learn of the heavenly Teacher, ... they will know for themselves that the fear of the
          Lord is indeed the beginning of wisdom. Having thus laid a sure foundation, they ... turn every privilege and
          opportunity to the very best account, and may rise to any height in intellectual attainments.</p>
