      <p>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 1 Corinthians 16:13</p>
      <p>Christ told His disciples that in the world they should have tribulation. They would be brought before kings
          and rulers for His sake; all manner of evil would be spoken against them falsely, and those who destroyed
          their lives would think they did God service. And all, in every age, who have lived godly lives have suffered
          persecution in some form.... They have suffered every indignity, outrage,</p>
      <p>and cruelty which Satan could move upon minds to invent.</p>
      <p>The world is as much opposed to genuine religion today as it ever has been....</p>
      <p>The spirit of persecution will ... be aroused against the faithful ones, who make no concessions to the world,
          and will not be swayed by its opinions, its favor, or its opposition. A religion that bears a living testimony
          in favor of holiness and that rebukes pride, selﬁshness, avarice, and fashionable sins will be hated by the
          world and by superﬁcial Christians. Marvel not, then, my youthful Christian friends, if the world hates you;
          for it hated your Master before you. When you suffer reproach and persecution, you are in excellent company;
          for Jesus endured it all, and much more. If you are faithful sentinels for God, these things are a compliment
          to you. It is the heroic souls, who will be true if they stand alone, who will win the imperishable
          crown....</p>
      <p>The way to eternal life is straight and narrow, and you will have to press through many difﬁculties; but by
          persevering effort you may win eternal <nobr>life–the</nobr> future, immortal inheritance. And the rest, the
          peace, the glory at the end of the journey, will a thousand times repay every exertion and sacriﬁce that you
          can make.</p>
