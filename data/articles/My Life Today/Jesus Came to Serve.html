      <p><strong>Walking Where Jesus Walked</strong></p>
      <p>Even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. Mark 10:45</p>
      <p>Many feel that it would be a great privilege to visit the scenes of Christ’s life on earth, to walk where He
          trod, to look upon the lake beside which He loved to teach, and the hills and valleys on which His eyes so
          often rested. But we need not go to Nazareth, to Capernaum, or to Bethany, in order to walk in the steps of
          Jesus. We shall ﬁnd His footprints beside the sickbed, in the hovels of poverty, in the crowded alleys of the
          great city, and in every place where there are human hearts in need of consolation. In doing as Jesus did when
          on earth, we shall walk in His steps....</p>
      <p>Millions upon millions of human souls ready to perish, bound in chains of ignorance and sin, have never so much
          as heard of Christ’s love for them. Were our condition and theirs to be reversed, what would we desire them to
          do for us? All this, so far as lies in our power, we are under the most solemn obligation to do for them.”
          Christ’s rule of life, by which every one of us must stand or fall in the judgment, is, “Whatsoever ye would
          that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”</p>
      <p>The Saviour has given His precious life in order to establish a church capable of caring for sorrowful, tempted
          souls. A company of believers may be poor, uneducated, and unknown; yet in Christ they may do a work in the
          home, the neighborhood, the church, and even in “the regions beyond,” whose results shall be as far reaching
          as eternity.</p>
      <p>It is because this work is neglected that so many young disciples never advance beyond the mere alphabet of
          Christian experience. The light which was glowing in their own hearts when Jesus spoke to them, “Thy sins be
          forgiven thee,” they might have kept alive by helping those in need. The restless energy that is so often a
          source of danger to the young might be directed into channels through which it would ﬂow out in streams of
          blessing. Self would be forgotten in earnest work to do others good.</p>
