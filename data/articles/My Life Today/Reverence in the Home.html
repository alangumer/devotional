      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk
          before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they
          that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 1 Samuel 2:30</p>
      <p>Make the home life as nearly as possible like heaven.</p>
      <p>In the home the foundation is laid for the prosperity of the church. The inﬂuences that rule in the home life
          are carried into the church life; therefore, church duties should ﬁrst begin in the home.</p>
      <p>Those who govern their families in the right way will bring into the church an inﬂuence of order and
          reverence.</p>
      <p>Fathers and mothers who make God ﬁrst in their households, who teach their children that the fear of the Lord
          is the beginning of wisdom, glorify God before angels and before men.... Christ is not a stranger in their
          homes; His name is</p>
      <p>a household name, revered and gloriﬁed. Angels delight in a home where God reigns supreme and the children are
          taught to reverence religion, the Bible, and their Creator. Such families can claim the promise, “Them that
          honour Me, I will honour.”</p>
      <p>The sacred privilege of communing with God makes distinct and clear the sight of the glorious things prepared
          for those who love God and reverence His commandments. We need to bring reverence into our daily
          lives....</p>
      <p>We bring too much that is little and common into the daily duties of life, and the result is that we fail to
          see Him who is invisible. Thus we lose many rich blessings in our religious experience.</p>
      <p>True reverence is revealed by obedience. God has commanded nothing that is unessential, and there is no other
          way of manifesting reverence so pleasing to Him as by obedience to that which He has spoken.</p>
