      <p><strong>Activities in Heaven</strong></p>
      <p>And they shall be all taught of God. John 6:45</p>
      <p>In the school of Christ students never graduate. Among the pupils are both the old and the young. Those who
          give heed to the instructions of the Divine Teacher constantly advance in wisdom, reﬁnement, and nobility of
          soul, and thus they are prepared to enter that higher school, where advancement will continue throughout
          eternity....</p>
      <p>To dwell forever in this home of the blest, to bear in soul, body, and spirit, not the dark traces of sin and
          the curse, but the perfect likeness of our Creator, and through ceaseless ages to advance in wisdom, in
          knowledge and holiness, ever exploring new ﬁelds of thought, ever ﬁnding new wonders and new glories, ever
          increasing in capacity to know and to enjoy and to love, and knowing that there is still beyond us joy and
          love and wisdom <nobr>inﬁnite–such</nobr> is the object to which the Christian hope is pointing.</p>
      <p>In the world to come Christ will lead the redeemed beside the river of life and will teach them wonderful
          lessons of truth. He will unfold to them the mysteries of nature. They will see that a master hand holds the
          world in position. They will behold the skill displayed by the great Artist in coloring the ﬂowers of the
          ﬁeld, and will learn of the purposes of the merciful Father, who dispenses every ray of light, and with the
          holy angels the redeemed will acknowledge in songs of grateful praise God’s supreme love to an unthankful
          world. Then it will be understood that “God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
          whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>
      <p>He [Christ] will impart rich stores of knowledge. He will unravel mysteries in the providences of God which in
          this life we are unable to understand.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>We must get an education here that will enable us to live with God through the eternal ages. The education we
          begin here will be perfected in heaven. We will only just enter a higher grade.</p>
