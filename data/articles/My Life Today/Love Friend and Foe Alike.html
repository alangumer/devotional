      <p>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among thieves? And he said, He that
          shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. Luke 10:36, 37</p>
      <p>Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as
          unconﬁned as the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth.... He made no difference
          between neighbors and strangers,</p>
      <p>friends and enemies....</p>
      <p>He passed by no human being as worthless.... In whatever company He found</p>
      <p>Himself, He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the circumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by
          men to their fellow men only made Him more conscious of their need of His <nobr>divine-human</nobr> sympathy.
          He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and most unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they
          might become blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as would make them manifest as the children of
          God.</p>
      <p>Often He met those who had drifted under Satan’s control and who had no power to break from his snare. To such
          a one, discouraged, sick, tempted, fallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest pity, words that were needed
          and could be understood. Others He met who were ﬁghting a <nobr>hand-to-hand</nobr> battle with the adversary
          of souls. These He encouraged to persevere, assuring them that they would win....</p>
      <p>At the table of the publicans He sat as an honored guest, by His sympathy and social kindliness showing that He
          recognized the dignity of humanity; and men longed to become worthy of His conﬁdence....</p>
      <p>Though He was a Jew, Jesus mingled freely with the Samaritans.... He slept</p>
      <p>with them under their roofs, ate with them at their <nobr>tables–partaking</nobr> of the food prepared and
          served by their <nobr>hands–taught</nobr> in their streets and treated them with the utmost kindness and
          courtesy. And while He drew their hearts to Him by the tie of human sympathy, His divine grace brought to them
          the salvation which the Jews rejected.</p>
