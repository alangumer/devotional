      <p><strong>Walking Where Jesus Walked</strong></p>
      <p>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the
          kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. Matthew 9:35</p>
      <p>What a busy life Christ led! Day by day He might be seen entering the humble abodes of want and sorrow,
          speaking hope to the downcast and peace to the distressed. The poor and suffering received the greatest share
          of His attention. Children loved Him. They were drawn to Him by His ready sympathy. By His simple, loving
          words He settled many a difﬁculty arising among them. Often He took them on His knee and talked with them in a
          way that won their hearts....</p>
      <p>Humble, gracious, tenderhearted, pitiful, He went about doing good, feeding the hungry, lifting up the bowed
          down, comforting the sorrowing. None who came to Him for aid went away unrelieved. Not a thread of selﬁshness
          was woven into the pattern He has left for His children to follow. He lived the life that He would have all
          live who believe on Him. It was His meat and drink to do the will of His Father. To all who came to Him for
          help He brought faith and hope and life. Wherever He went He carried blessing.</p>
      <p>The tender sympathies of our Saviour were aroused for fallen and suffering humanity. If you would be His
          followers, you must cultivate compassion and sympathy. Indifference to human woes must give place to lively
          interest in the sufferings of others. The widow, the orphan, the sick and the dying, will always need help.
          Here is an opportunity to proclaim the <nobr>gospel–to</nobr> hold up Jesus, the hope and consolation of all
          men. When the suffering body has been relieved, and you have shown a lively interest in the afﬂicted, the
          heart is opened, and you can pour in the heavenly balm. If you are looking to Jesus, and drawing from Him
          knowledge and strength and grace, you can impart His consolation to others, because the Comforter is with
          you.</p>
