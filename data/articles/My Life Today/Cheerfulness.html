      <p>He sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. Romans 12:8</p>
      <p>You have a duty to perform, which is to make yourself cheerful and to cultivate unselﬁshness in your feelings
          until it will be your greatest pleasure to make all around you happy....</p>
      <p>Cheerfulness without levity is one of the Christian graces.</p>
      <p>Do not allow the perplexities and worries of everyday life to fret your mind and cloud your brow. If you do,
          you will always have something to vex and annoy. Life is what we make it, and we shall ﬁnd what we look for.
          If we look for sadness and trouble, if we are in a frame of mind to magnify little difﬁculties, we shall ﬁnd
          plenty of them to engross our thoughts and our conversation. But if we look on the bright side of things, we
          shall ﬁnd enough to make us cheerful and happy. If we give smiles, they will be returned to us; if we speak
          pleasant, cheerful words, they will be spoken to us again.</p>
      <p>It is Satan’s studied plan to push persons from one extreme to the other. As children of the light, God would
          have us cultivate a cheerful, happy spirit, that we may show forth the praises of Him who hath called us out
          of darkness into His marvellous light.</p>
      <p>Go into a cellar, and you may well talk of darkness, and say, “I cannot see; I cannot see.” But come up into
          the upper chamber, where the light shines, and you need not be in darkness. Come up where Christ is, and you
          will have light.</p>
      <p>Earnest Christians seek to imitate Jesus, for to be Christians is to be Christlike.... A hearty, willing
          service to Jesus produces a sunny religion.... In</p>
      <p>Christ is light and peace and joy forevermore.</p>
