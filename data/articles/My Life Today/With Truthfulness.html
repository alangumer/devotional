    <h1>With Truthfulness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I Too May Conquer</strong></p>
      <p>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their
          mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. Zephaniah 3:13</p>
      <p>Truthfulness and integrity are attributes of God, and he who possesses these qualities possesses a power that
          is invincible.</p>
      <p>Never prevaricate; never tell an untruth in precept or in example.... Be straight</p>
      <p>and undeviating. Even a slight prevarication should not be allowed.</p>
      <p>The Saviour has a deep contempt for all deception. The stern punishment meted out to Ananias and Sapphira shows
          this.</p>
      <p>Lying lips are an abomination to Him. He declares that into the holy city “there shall in no wise enter ... any
          thing that deﬁleth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie.” Let truth telling be held with
          no loose hand or uncertain grasp. Let it become a part of the life. Playing fast and loose with truth, and
          dissembling to suit one’s own selﬁsh plans, means shipwreck of faith.... He</p>
      <p>who utters untruths sells his soul in a cheap market. His falsehoods may seem to serve in emergencies; he may
          thus seem to make business advancement that he could not gain by fair dealing; but he ﬁnally reaches the place
          where he can trust no one. Himself a falsiﬁer, he has no conﬁdence in the word of others.</p>
      <p>No man can pride himself on his truthfulness, for unless he has overcome he does not know what truthfulness is.
          No one can know the strength of his truthfulness and honesty until he has passed the ﬁery ordeal of the
          temptation to acquire means in questionable ways.</p>
      <p>He whose heart is ﬁlled with the love that proceeds from God does not allow <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> or
          dishonesty to ﬁnd place in his life. He who is “born again,” of the Spirit, reveals Christ in the daily life.
          He is upright in all his dealings. He does no sly, cunning, underhand work. The good fruit that appears in his
          life testiﬁes to the condition of his heart.</p>
