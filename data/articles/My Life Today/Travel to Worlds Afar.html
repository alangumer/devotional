      <p>These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
          ﬁrstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. Revelation 14:4</p>
      <p>All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God’s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they
          wing their tireless ﬂight to worlds <nobr>afar–worlds</nobr> that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of
          human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable delight the
          children of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge
          and understanding gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God’s handiwork. With undimmed vision they
          gaze upon the glory of <nobr>creation–suns</nobr> and stars and systems, all in their appointed order circling
          the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator’s name is written, and in
          all are the riches of His power displayed.</p>
      <p>And the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still more glorious revelations of God and of
          Christ. As knowledge is progressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more men learn of
          God, the greater will be their admiration of His character. As Jesus opens before them the riches of
          redemption, and the amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan, the hearts of the ransomed
          thrill with more fervent devotion, and with more rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and ten thousand
          times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to swell the mighty chorus of praise....</p>
      <p>The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony
          and gladness beats through the vast creation. From Him who created all, ﬂow life and light and gladness
          throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, ... in
          their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy declare that God is love.</p>
