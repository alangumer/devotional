      <p><strong>Activities in Heaven</strong></p>
      <p>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They
          shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the
          days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. Isaiah 65:21, 22</p>
      <p>There the <nobr>wide-spreading</nobr> plains swell into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their
          lofty summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God’s people, so long pilgrims and
          wanderers, shall ﬁnd a home.</p>
      <p>“My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.”</p>
      <p>In the earth made new the redeemed will engage in the occupations and pleasure that brought happiness to Adam
          and Eve in the beginning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and ﬁeld. “They shall build houses,
          and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them....”</p>
      <p>There every power will be developed, every capability increased. The grandest enterprises will be carried
          forward, the loftiest aspirations will be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And there will appear new
          heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects of study to call forth the
          powers of body and mind and soul.</p>
      <p>There certainly is and ever will be employment in heaven. The whole family of the redeemed will not live in a
          state of dreamy idleness. There remaineth a rest to the people of God. In heaven activity will not be wearing
          and burdensome; it will be rest. The whole family of the redeemed will ﬁnd their delight in serving Him whose
          they are by creation and by redemption.</p>
      <p>To the weary and heavy laden, to those who have fought the good ﬁght of faith, it will be a glorious rest; for
          the youth and vigor of immortality will be theirs, and against sin and Satan they will no longer have to
          contend.</p>
