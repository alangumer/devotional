      <p><strong>Elements of Good Health</strong></p>
      <p>On the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work
          which he had made. Genesis 2:2, 3</p>
      <p>God reserved the seventh day as a period of rest for man, for the good of man as well as for His own glory. He
          saw that the wants of man required a day of rest from toil and care, that his health and life would be
          endangered without a period of relaxation from the labor and anxiety of the six days.</p>
      <p>The Sabbath of the Lord is to be made a blessing to us and to our children....</p>
      <p>They can be pointed to the blooming ﬂowers and the opening buds, the lofty trees and beautiful spires of grass,
          and taught that God made all these in six days, and rested on the seventh day, and hallowed it. Thus the
          parents may bind up their lessons of instruction to their children, so that when these children look upon the
          things of nature, they will call to mind the great Creator of them all. Their thoughts will be carried up to
          nature’s <nobr>God–back</nobr> to the creation of our world, when the foundation of the Sabbath was laid, and
          all the sons of God shouted for joy.</p>
      <p>Happy is the family who can go to the place of worship on the Sabbath as Jesus and His disciples went to the
          <nobr>synagogue–across</nobr> the ﬁelds, along the shores of the lake, or through the groves.</p>
      <p>The Sabbath bids us behold in His created works the glory of the Creator. And it is because He desired us to do
          this that Jesus bound up His precious lessons with the beauty of natural things. On the holy rest day, above
          all other days, we should study the messages that God has written for us in nature. We should study the
          Saviour’s parables where He spoke them, in the ﬁelds and groves, under the open sky, among the grass and
          ﬂowers. As we come close to the heart of nature, Christ makes His presence real to us and speaks to our hearts
          of His peace and love.</p>
