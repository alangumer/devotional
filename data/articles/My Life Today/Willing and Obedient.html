      <p><strong>Highways to Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land. Isaiah 1:19 In requiring obedience to the
          laws of His kingdom, God gives His people</p>
      <p>health and happiness, peace and joy.</p>
      <p>To the great principle of love and loyalty to God, the Father of all, the principle of ﬁlial love and obedience
          is closely related. Contempt for parental authority will soon lead to contempt for the authority of God.</p>
      <p>At a very early age children can comprehend what is plainly and simply told them, and by kind and judicious
          management can be taught to obey.... The mother</p>
      <p>should not allow her child to gain an advantage over her in a single instance. And in order to maintain this
          authority it is not necessary to resort to harsh measures; a ﬁrm, steady hand and a kindness which convinces
          the child of your love will accomplish the purpose.</p>
      <p>When children love and repose conﬁdence in their mother, and have become obedient to her, they have been taught
          the ﬁrst lessons in becoming Christians. They must be obedient to and love and trust Jesus as they are
          obedient to and love and trust their parents.</p>
      <p>Prompt and continual obedience to wise parental rule will promote the happiness of the children themselves as
          well as the honor of God and the good of society. Children should learn that in submission to the laws of the
          household is their perfect liberty. Christians will learn the same <nobr>lesson–that</nobr> in their obedience
          to God’s law is their perfect freedom.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Children will be happier, far happier, under proper discipline than if left to do as their untrained impulses
          shall suggest.</p>
