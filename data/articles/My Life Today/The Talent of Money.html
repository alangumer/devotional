    <h1>The Talent of Money</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
          bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of
          necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 2 Corinthians 9:6, 7</p>
      <p>In the parable of the talents we have two classes brought to view. One class is represented by the diligent
          servant, and the other by the wicked and slothful servant. They had both been entrusted with their Lord’s
          money. One went to work with earnestness, seeking opportunities to use his entrusted gift in such a way that
          others would be blessed and beneﬁted. He does not live simply to please himself, to gratify selﬁsh desires, to
          delight in pleasure parties and in places of amusement, seeking for gratiﬁcation of his ﬂeshly lusts, as
          though this were the object of life; but he thinks soberly, and remembers that his religious life is
          short.</p>
      <p>It is God who gives men power to get wealth, and He has bestowed this ability, not as a means of gratifying
          self, but as a means of returning to God His own. With this object it is not a sin to acquire means. Money is
          to be earned by labor. Every youth should be trained to habits of industry. The Bible condemns no man for
          being rich if he has acquired his riches honestly.... Wealth will prove a blessing if</p>
      <p>we regard it as the Lord’s, to be received with thankfulness and with thankfulness returned to the Giver.</p>
      <p>Money has great value, because it can do great good. In the hands of God’s children it is food for the hungry,
          drink for the thirsty, and clothing for the naked. It is a defense for the oppressed and a means of help to
          the sick. But money is of no more value than sand, only as it is put to use in providing for the necessities
          of life, in blessing others, and advancing the cause of Christ.</p>
