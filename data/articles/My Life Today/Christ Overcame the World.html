    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Those Who Have Conquered</strong></p>
      <p>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation:
          but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. John 16:33</p>
      <p>When the last steps of Christ’s humiliation were to be taken, when the deepest sorrow was closing about His
          soul, He said to His disciples, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.” “The prince of this
          world is judged.” Now shall he be cast out. With prophetic eye Christ traced the scenes to take place in His
          last great conﬂict. He knew that when He should exclaim, “It is ﬁnished,” all heaven would triumph. His ear
          caught the distant music and the shouts of victory in the heavenly courts. He knew that the knell of Satan’s
          empire would then be sounded, and the name of Christ would be heralded from world to world throughout the
          universe.</p>
      <p>Christ rejoiced that He could do more for His followers than they could ask or think. He spoke with assurance,
          knowing that an almighty decree had been given before the world was made. He knew that truth, armed with the
          omnipotence of the Holy Spirit, would conquer in the contest with evil; and that the bloodstained banner would
          wave triumphantly over His followers. He knew that the life of His trusting disciples would be like His, a
          series of uninterrupted victories, not seen to be such here, but recognized as such in the great
          hereafter....</p>
      <p>“In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” Christ did not fail,
          neither was He discouraged, and His followers are to manifest a faith of the same enduring nature.... Though
          apparent impossibilities</p>
      <p>obstruct their way, by His grace they are to go forward.... They are to have power</p>
      <p>to resist evil, power that neither earth, nor death, nor hell can master, power that will enable them to
          overcome as Christ overcame.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>Satan trembles and ﬂees before the weakest soul who ﬁnds refuge in that mighty name.</p>
