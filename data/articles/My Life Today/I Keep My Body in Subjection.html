    <h1>I Keep My Body in Subjection</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Exercising <nobr>Self-control</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others,
          I myself should be a castaway. 1 Corinthians 9:27</p>
      <p>The body is the only medium through which the mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding of character.
          Hence it is that the adversary of souls directs his temptations to the enfeebling and degrading of the
          physical powers. His success here means the surrender to evil of the whole being. The tendencies of our
          physical nature, unless under the dominion of a higher power, will surely work ruin and death.</p>
      <p>The body is to be brought into subjection. The higher powers of the being are to rule. The passions are to be
          controlled by the will, which is itself to be under the control of God....</p>
      <p>The requirements of God must be brought home to the conscience. Men and women must be awakened to the duty of
          <nobr>self-mastery,</nobr> the need of purity, freedom from every depraving appetite and deﬁling habit. They
          need to be impressed with the fact that all their powers of mind and body are the gift of God, and are to be
          preserved in the best possible condition for His service....</p>
      <p>Human barriers against natural and cultivated tendencies are but as the sandbank against the torrent. Not until
          the life of Christ becomes a vitalizing power in our lives can we resist the temptations that assail us from
          within and from without.... By becoming one with Christ, man is free. Subjection to the will</p>
      <p>of Christ means restoration to perfect manhood.</p>
      <p>Obedience to God is liberty from the thraldom of sin, deliverance from human passion and impulse. Man may stand
          conqueror of himself, conqueror of his own inclinations, conqueror of principalities and powers, and of “the
          rulers of the darkness of this world,” and of “spiritual wickedness in high places.”</p>
