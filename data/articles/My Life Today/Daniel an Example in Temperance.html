    <h1>Daniel an Example in Temperance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Temperate in All Things</strong></p>
      <p>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
          Azariah.... And in all matters of wisdom</p>
      <p>and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and
          astrologers that were in all his realm. Daniel 1:19, 20</p>
      <p>During their three years of training, Daniel and his associates maintained their abstemious habits, their
          allegiance to God, and their constant dependence upon His power. When the time came for their abilities and
          acquirements to be tested by the king, they were examined with other candidates for the service of the
          kingdom.... Their keen apprehension, their choice and exact language, their</p>
      <p>extensive knowledge, testiﬁed to the unimpaired strength and vigor of their mental power....</p>
      <p>God always honors the right. The most promising youths from all the lands subdued by the great conqueror had
          been gathered at Babylon, yet amid them all the Hebrew captives were without a rival. The erect form, the ﬁrm,
          elastic step, the fair countenance, the undimmed senses, the untainted <nobr>breath–all</nobr> these were
          insignia of the nobility with which nature honors those who are obedient to her laws....</p>
      <p>Amid the seductive inﬂuences of the luxurious courts of Babylon they stood ﬁrm. The youth of today are
          surrounded with allurements to <nobr>self-indulgence.</nobr> Especially in our large cities, every form of
          sensual gratiﬁcation is made easy and inviting. Those who, like Daniel, refuse to deﬁle themselves will reap
          the reward of temperate habits....</p>
      <p>Daniel’s clearness of mind and ﬁrmness of purpose, his power in acquiring knowledge and in resisting
          temptation, were due in a great degree to the plainness of his diet, in connection with his life of
          prayer....</p>
      <p>Stand forth in your <nobr>God-given</nobr> manhood and womanhood.... God will reward</p>
      <p>you with calm nerves, a clear brain, an unimpaired judgment, keen perceptions. The youth of today whose
          principles are ﬁrm and unwavering will be blessed with health of body, mind, and soul.</p>
