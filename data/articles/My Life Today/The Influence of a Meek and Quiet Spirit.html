      <p><strong>Exerting a Right Inﬂuence</strong></p>
      <p>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting
          on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament
          of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 1 Peter 3:3, 4</p>
      <p>The apostle presents the inward adorning, in contrast with the outward, and tells us what the great God values.
          The outward is corruptible. But the meek and quiet spirit, the development of a beautifully symmetrical
          character, will never decay. It is an adornment which is not perishable. In the sight of the Creator of
          everything that is valuable, lovely, and beautiful it is declared to be of great price.</p>
      <p>Shall we not seek earnestly to gain that which God estimates as more valuable than costly dress, or pearls, or
          gold? The inward adorning, the grace of meekness, a spirit in harmony with the heavenly angels, will not
          lessen true dignity of character or make us less lovely here in this world. The Redeemer has warned us against
          the pride of life, but not against its grace and natural beauty.</p>
      <p><nobr>Self-denial</nobr> in dress is a part of our Christian duty. To dress plainly and abstain from display of
          jewelry and ornaments of every kind is in keeping with our faith.</p>
      <p>It is of the greatest importance that we ... show by precept and example that we are cultivating that which the
          Monarch of the universe estimates of great value. In doing this what an inﬂuence for good can we have.</p>
      <p>Children and youth who devote time and means to make themselves objects of attraction by outward display and
          affected manners are not working in the right direction. They need to cultivate true, Christian politeness and
          nobility of soul....</p>
      <p>The beauty of mind, the purity of the soul, revealed in the countenance, will have more power to attract and
          exert an inﬂuence upon hearts than any outward adorning.</p>
