    <h1>Keep the Commandments</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Prepering for Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in
          through the gates into the city. Revelation 22:14</p>
      <p>The conﬂict is before us. The only safety for any one of us now is to be one with Christ in God. We are to
          strive to enter in at the strait gate. But this gate does not swing loosely on its hinges. It will not admit
          doubtful characters. We must now strive for eternal life with an intensity that is proportionate to the value
          of the prize before us. It is not money or lands or position, but the possession of a Christlike character,
          that will open to us the gates of Paradise. It is not dignity, it is not intellectual attainments, that will
          win for us the crown of immortality. Only the meek and lowly ones, who have made God their sufﬁciency, will
          receive this gift....</p>
      <p>To create the soul anew, to bring light out of darkness, love out of enmity, holiness out of impurity, is the
          work of Omnipotence alone. The work of the Inﬁnite, as He engages, by the consent of the human being, to make
          the life complete in Christ, to bring perfection to the character, is the science of eternity.</p>
      <p>What is the honor conferred upon Christ? Without employing any compulsion, without using any violence, He
          blends the will of the human subject to the will of God. This is the science of all true science; for by it a
          mighty change is wrought in mind and <nobr>character–the</nobr> change that must be wrought in the life of
          every one who passes through the gates of the city of God.</p>
      <p>Then they that have kept God’s commandments shall breathe in immortal vigor beneath the tree of life; and
          through unending ages the inhabitants of sinless worlds shall behold, in that garden [Eden] of delight, a
          sample of the perfect work of God’s creation, untouched by the curse of <nobr>sin–a</nobr> sample of what the
          whole earth would have become, had man but fulﬁlled the Creator’s glorious plan.</p>
