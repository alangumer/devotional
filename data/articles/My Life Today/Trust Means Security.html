      <p>Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. He shall not be
          afraid of evil tidings: his heart is ﬁxed, trusting in the Lord. Psalm 112:6, 7</p>
      <p>God has given in His Word sufﬁcient evidence of its divine character. The great truths which concern our
          redemption are clearly presented. By the aid of the Holy Spirit, which is promised to all who seek it in
          sincerity, every man may understand these truths for himself. God has granted to men a strong foundation upon
          which to rest their faith.</p>
      <p>Yet the ﬁnite minds of men are inadequate fully to comprehend the plans and purposes of the Inﬁnite One. We can
          never by searching ﬁnd out God. We must not attempt to lift with presumptuous hand the curtain behind which He
          veils His majesty. The apostle exclaims, “How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past ﬁnding out!”
          We can so far comprehend His dealings with us and the motives by which He is actuated that we may discern
          boundless love and mercy united to inﬁnite power. Our Father in heaven orders everything in wisdom and
          righteousness, and we are not to be dissatisﬁed and distrustful, but to bow in reverent submission. He will
          reveal to us as much of His purposes as it is for our good to know, and beyond that we must trust the Hand
          that is omnipotent, the Heart that is full of love.</p>
      <p>While God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never remove all excuse for unbelief. All who look for
          hooks to hang their doubts upon will ﬁnd them....</p>
      <p>Distrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart, which is at enmity with Him. But faith is
          inspired by the Holy Spirit, and it will ﬂourish only as it is cherished. No man can become strong in faith
          without a determined effort.... Only in humble reliance upon God and obedience to all His</p>
      <p>commandments can we be secure.</p>
