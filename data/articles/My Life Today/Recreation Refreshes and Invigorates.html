      <p><strong>Recreation and Amusements</strong></p>
      <p>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures
          for evermore. Psalm 16:11</p>
      <p>It is the privilege and duty of Christians to seek to refresh their spirits and invigorate their bodies by
          innocent recreation, with the purpose of using their physical and mental powers to the glory of God. Our
          recreation should not be scenes of senseless mirth, taking the form of the nonsensical. We can conduct them in
          such a manner as will beneﬁt and elevate those with whom we associate and better qualify us and them to more
          successfully attend to the duties devolving upon us as Christians.... The religion of Christ is cheering and
          elevating in its</p>
      <p>inﬂuence. It is above everything like foolish jesting and joking, vain and frivolous chitchat. In all our
          seasons of recreation we may gather from the Divine Source of strength fresh courage and power, that we may
          the more successfully elevate our lives to purity, true goodness, and holiness.</p>
      <p>There are persons with a diseased imagination to whom religion is a tyrant, ruling them as with a rod of iron.
          Such are constantly mourning over their depravity and groaning over supposed evil. Love does not exist in
          their hearts; a frown is ever upon their countenances. They are chilled by the innocent laugh from the youth
          or from anyone. They consider all recreation or amusement a sin and think that the mind must be constantly
          wrought up to just such a stern, severe pitch. This is one extreme. Others think that the mind must be ever on
          the stretch to invent new amusements and diversions in order to gain health. They learn to depend on
          excitement, and are uneasy without it. Such are not true Christians. They go to another extreme. The true
          principles of Christianity open before all a source of happiness, the height and depth, the length and breadth
          of which are immeasurable.</p>
