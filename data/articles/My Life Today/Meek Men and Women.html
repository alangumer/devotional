      <p><strong>Examples of Sanctiﬁed Lives</strong></p>
      <p>He will beautify the meek with salvation. Psalm 149:4</p>
      <p>The most precious fruit of sanctiﬁcation is the grace of meekness. When this grace presides in the soul the
          disposition is molded by its inﬂuence. There is a continual waiting upon God and a submission of the will to
          His. The understanding grasps every divine truth and the will bows to every divine precept, without doubting
          or murmuring. True meekness softens and subdues the heart and gives the mind a ﬁtness for the engrafted word.
          It brings the thoughts into obedience to Jesus Christ. It opens the heart to the Word of God, as Lydia’s was
          opened. It places us with Mary, as learners at the feet of Jesus. “The meek will He guide in judgment, and the
          meek will He teach His way.”</p>
      <p>The language of the meek is never that of boasting. Like the child Samuel, they pray, “Speak, Lord, for Thy
          servant heareth.” When Joshua was placed in the highest position of honor, as commander of Israel, he bade
          deﬁance to all the enemies of God. His heart was ﬁlled with noble thoughts of his great mission. Yet upon the
          intimation of a message from Heaven, he placed himself in the position of a little child to be directed. “What
          saith my Lord unto His servant?” was his response....</p>
      <p>Meekness in the school of Christ is one of the marked fruits of the Spirit. It is a grace wrought by the Holy
          Spirit as a sanctiﬁer, and enables its possessor at all times to control a rash and impetuous temper....</p>
      <p>Meekness is the inward adorning, which God estimates as of great price.... He</p>
      <p>who garnished the heavens with the orbs of light has by the same Spirit promised that “He will beautify the
          meek with salvation.” Angels of heaven will register as best adorned those who put on the Lord Jesus Christ
          and walk with Him in meekness and lowliness of mind.</p>
