      <p><strong>The Work of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
          glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18</p>
      <p>It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the
          divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated
          tendencies to evil and to impress His own character on His church....</p>
      <p>When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away,
          evil deeds are renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the
          place of sadness, and the countenance reﬂects the joy of heaven. No one sees the hand that lifts the burden or
          beholds the light descend from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself
          to God. Then that power which no human eye can see, creates a new being in the image of God.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation
          of the life of Christ. It imbues the receiver with the attributes of Christ....</p>
      <p>The religion that comes from God is the only religion that will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we
          must be born of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new capacity for
          knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true worship. It
          is the fruit of the working of the Holy Spirit. By the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer
          is acceptable to God. Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit’s working is manifest, and God
          will reveal Himself to that soul. For such worshipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them and to make them
          His sons and daughters.</p>
