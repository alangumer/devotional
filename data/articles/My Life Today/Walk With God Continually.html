    <h1>Walk With God Continually</h1>

      <p><strong>Prepering for Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. Genesis 5:24</p>
      <p>When God takes the members of His church to heaven, it will be because they have walked with Him here on this
          earth, receiving from above strength and wisdom which enables them to serve Him aright. Those who are taken to
          God will be men and women who now pray in humility and contrition, whose hearts are not lifted up unto vanity.
          In their dealing with believers and unbelievers they represent Christ.</p>
      <p>Those who have no pleasure in thinking and talking of God in this life will not enjoy the life that is to come,
          where God is ever present, dwelling among His people. But those who love to think of God will be in their
          element, breathing in the atmosphere of heaven. Those who on earth love the thought of heaven will be happy in
          its holy associations and pleasures....</p>
      <p>When in the world they did not claim to be their own, and God set to His seal that they were His. Heaven will
          be for those who desire it with intense desire, who put forth efforts in proportion to the value of the object
          which they seek. The thoughts of those who will obtain heaven will be upon heavenly things.</p>
      <p>“Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.” For three hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity
          of soul, that he might be in harmony with Heaven. For three centuries he had walked with God. Day by day he
          had longed for a closer union; nearer and nearer had grown the communion, until God took him to Himself. He
          had stood at the threshold of the eternal world, only a step between him and the land of the blest; and now
          the portals opened, the walk with God, so long pursued on earth, continued, and he passed through the gates of
          the Holy <nobr>City–the</nobr> ﬁrst from among men to enter there.</p>
