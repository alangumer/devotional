    <h1>June—A Happy Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Remember Your Creator in Your Youth</strong></p>
      <p>Christians Are Truly Happy</p>
      <p>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when
          thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them. Ecclesiastes 12:1</p>
      <p>I wish I could portray the beauty of the Christian life. Beginning in the morning of life, controlled by the
          laws of nature and of God, the Christian moves steadily onward and upward, daily drawing nearer his heavenly
          home, where await for him a crown of life, and a new name, “which no man knoweth saving him that receiveth
          it.” Constantly he grows in happiness, in holiness, in usefulness. The progress of each year exceeds that of
          the past year.</p>
      <p>God has given the youth a ladder to climb, a ladder that reaches from earth to heaven. Above this ladder is
          God, and on every round fall the bright beams of his glory. He is watching those who are climbing, ready, when
          the grasp relaxes and the steps falter, to send help. Yes, tell it in words full of cheer, that no one who
          perseveringly climbs the ladder will fail of gaining an entrance into the heavenly city.</p>
      <p>Angels of God, that ascend and descend the ladder that Jacob saw in vision, will help every soul who will to
          climb even to the highest heaven. They are guarding the people of God and watching how every step is taken.
          Those who climb the shining way will be rewarded; they will enter into the joy of their Lord.</p>
      <p>Early piety ensures to its possessor the full enjoyment of all that makes life happy.... Those who wait until
          the span of life is almost ended before they seek</p>
      <p>God, lose a life of pure, elevated <nobr>happiness–happiness</nobr> that never comes in pursuit of the
          pleasures that this life affords. Those who have been long acquainted with God, who from their youth have
          drawn their happiness from the pure fountain of heaven, are prepared to enter the family of God.</p>
