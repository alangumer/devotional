    <h1>Purity in This Corrupt Age</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Living by Principle Not Inclination</strong></p>
      <p>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and
          a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. Psalm 24:3, 4</p>
      <p>The safeguards of our purity must be watchfulness and prayer.</p>
      <p>We are living in an atmosphere of satanic witchery. The enemy will weave a spell of licentiousness around every
          soul that is not barricaded by the grace of Christ. Temptations will come; but if we watch against the enemy,
          and maintain the balance of <nobr>self-control</nobr> and purity, the seducing spirits will have no inﬂuence
          over us. Those who do nothing to encourage temptation will have strength to withstand it when it comes.</p>
      <p>If they [the youth] do not willfully rush into danger, and needlessly place themselves in the way of
          temptation, if they shun evil inﬂuences and vicious society, and then are unavoidably compelled to be in
          dangerous company, they will have strength of character to stand for the right and to preserve principle, and
          come forth in the strength of God with their morals untainted. If youth who have been properly educated make
          God their trust, their moral powers will stand the most powerful test.</p>
      <p>God’s elect must stand untainted amid the corruptions teeming around them in these last days.... The Spirit of
          God should have perfect control, inﬂuencing</p>
      <p>every action.</p>
      <p>Those who enter upon active life with ﬁrm principles will be prepared to stand unsullied amid the moral
          pollutions of this corrupt age.</p>
      <p>“Who, O Lord, shall stand when thou appearest?” Only those who have clean hands and a pure heart shall abide in
          the day of His coming.... As you hope to be</p>
      <p>ﬁnally exalted to join the society of sinless angels and to live in an atmosphere where there is not the least
          taint of sin, seek purity; for nothing else will abide the searching test of the day of God and be received
          into a pure and holy heaven.</p>
