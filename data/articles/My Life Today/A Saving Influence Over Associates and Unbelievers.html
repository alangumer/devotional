    <h1>A Saving Inﬂuence Over Associates and Unbelievers</h1>

      <p><strong>Exerting a Right Inﬂuence</strong></p>
      <p>Ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord
          not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to <nobr>God-ward</nobr> is spread
          abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 1 Thessalonians 1:7, 8</p>
      <p>If you can exert a saving inﬂuence over one soul, remember there is joy in heaven over the one that
          repented.... You may, by judicious effort, be the means</p>
      <p>of bringing back the lost sheep to Jesus’ fold. Although you may be young, you must work with Christ; with His
          spirit in your heart you can do much more than it now seems possible for you to do.</p>
      <p>If your example is Christlike, that alone, if you do not say a word, will be a help to many. Patient
          continuance in <nobr>well-doing</nobr> will help others to place their feet in the path of truth and
          righteousness.... Be careful to start right, and then keep</p>
      <p>quietly on.</p>
      <p>The ﬁrm purposes you may possess in carrying out good principles will have an inﬂuence to balance souls in the
          right direction. There is no limit to the good you may do. If you make the Word of God the rule of your life,
          and govern your actions by its precepts, making all your purposes and exertions in the fulﬁlling of your duty
          a blessing ... , success will crown your efforts.</p>
      <p>The youth who are consecrated to God sway a mighty inﬂuence for good. Preachers or laymen advanced in years
          cannot have one half the inﬂuence for good upon the young that the youth, if devoted to God, can have upon
          their associates.</p>
      <p>The silent witness of a true, unselﬁsh, godly life carries an almost irresistible inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>The unstudied, unconscious inﬂuence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon that can be given in favor of
          Christianity.</p>
