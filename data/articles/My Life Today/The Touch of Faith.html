      <p><strong>Faith in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and
          when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made
          whole from that hour. Matthew 9:21, 22</p>
      <p>To talk of religious things in a casual way, to pray for spiritual blessings without real soul hunger and
          living faith, avails little. The wondering crowd that pressed close about Christ realized no vital power from
          the contact. But when the poor, suffering woman, in her great need, put forth her hand and touched the hem of
          Jesus’ garment, she felt the healing virtue. Hers was the touch of faith. Christ recognized that touch, and He
          determined there to give a lesson for all His followers to the close of time. He knew that virtue had gone out
          of Him, and turning about in the throng He said, “Who touched My clothes?” Surprised at such a question, His
          disciples answered, “Thou seest the multitude thronging Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me?”</p>
      <p>Jesus ﬁxed His eyes upon her who had done this. She was ﬁlled with fear. Great joy was hers; but had she
          overstepped her duty? Knowing what was done in her, she came trembling, and fell at His feet, and told Him all
          the truth. Christ did not reproach her. He gently said, “Go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.” Here was
          distinguished the casual contact from the touch of faith. Prayer and preaching, without the exercise of living
          faith in God, will be in vain. But the touch of faith opens to us the divine treasure house of power and
          wisdom; and</p>
      <p>thus, through instruments of clay, God accomplishes the wonders of His grace. This living faith is our great
          need today. We must know that Jesus is indeed</p>
      <p>ours; that His Spirit is purifying and reﬁning our hearts. If the followers of Christ had genuine faith, with
          meekness and love, what a work they might accomplish! What fruit would be seen to the glory of God!</p>
