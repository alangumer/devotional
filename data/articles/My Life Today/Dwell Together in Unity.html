    <h1>Dwell Together in Unity</h1>

      <p><strong>Partakers of the Divine Nature</strong></p>
      <p>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! Psalm 133:1</p>
      <p>Christian unity is a mighty agency. It tells in a powerful manner that those who possess it are children of
          God. It has an irresistible inﬂuence upon the world, showing that man in his humanity may be a partaker of the
          divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. We are to be one with our
          fellow men and with Christ, and in Christ one with God. Then of us can be spoken the words, “Ye are complete
          in Him.”</p>
      <p>In the plan of redemption a place is allotted to every soul. To each man is given his work. No one can be a
          member of Christ’s body and yet be inactive....</p>
      <p>The work of God’s people may and will be varied, but one Spirit is the mover in it all. All the work done for
          the Master is to be connected with the great whole. The workers are to labor together in concert, each one
          controlled by divine power, putting forth undivided effort to draw those around them to Christ. All must move
          like parts of a <nobr>well-adjusted</nobr> machinery, each part dependent on the other part, yet standing
          distinct in action. And each one is to take the place assigned him and do the work appointed him. God calls
          upon the members of His church to receive the Holy Spirit, to come together in unity and brotherly sympathy,
          to bind their interests together in love.</p>
      <p>Nothing so manifestly weakens a church as disunion and strife. Nothing so wars against Christ and the truth as
          this spirit....</p>
      <p>He in whose heart Christ abides recognizes Christ abiding in the heart of his brother. Christ never wars
          against Christ. Christ never exerts an inﬂuence against Christ. Christians are to do their work, whatever it
          may be, in the unity of the Spirit, for the perfecting of the whole body.</p>
