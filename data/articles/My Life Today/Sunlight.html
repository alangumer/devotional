      <p><strong>Elements of Good Health</strong></p>
      <p>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. Ecclesiastes 11:7</p>
      <p>There are but few who realize that, in order to enjoy health and cheerfulness, they must have an abundance of
          sunlight, pure air, and physical exercise. We pity little children who are kept conﬁned indoors when the sun
          is shining gloriously without.</p>
      <p>Clothe your boys and girls comfortably and properly.... Then let them go out</p>
      <p>and exercise in the open air, and live to enjoy health and happiness.</p>
      <p>The pale and sickly <nobr>grain-blade</nobr> that has struggled up out of the cold of early spring puts out the
          natural and healthy deep green after enjoying for a few days the <nobr>health-and-life-giving</nobr> rays of
          the sun. Go out into the light and warmth of the glorious sun, ... and share with vegetation its
          <nobr>life-giving,</nobr> healing power.</p>
      <p>No room in the house should be considered furnished and adorned without the cheering, enlivening light and
          sunshine, which are Heaven’s own free gift to man....</p>
      <p>When God had made our world, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, he said, Let there be light, and there
          was light. And God saw the light that it was good. Shall we close our houses, and exclude from them the light
          which God has pronounced good?</p>
      <p>If you would have your homes sweet and inviting, make them bright with air and sunshine.... The precious
          sunlight may fade your carpets, but it will give a</p>
      <p>healthful color to the cheeks of your children. If you have God’s presence, and possess earnest, loving hearts,
          a humble home, made bright with air and sunlight</p>
      <p>... will be to your family ... a heaven below.</p>
      <p>Exercise and a free abundant use of the air and <nobr>sunlight–blessings</nobr> which Heaven has freely
          bestowed upon <nobr>all–would</nobr> give life and strength.</p>
