      <p><strong>Growing in Grace</strong></p>
      <p>By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured
          more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 1 Corinthians 15:10</p>
      <p>There are those who attempt to ascend the ladder of Christian progress; but as they advance, they begin to put
          their trust in the power of man, and soon lose sight of Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of their faith. The
          result is <nobr>failure–the</nobr> loss of all that has been gained. Sad indeed is the condition of those who,
          becoming weary of the way, allow the enemy of souls to rob them of the Christian graces.</p>
      <p>The love of God in the soul will have a direct inﬂuence upon the life and will call the intellect and the
          affections into active, healthful exercise. The child of God will not rest satisﬁed until he is clothed with
          the righteousness of Christ and sustained by His <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power. When he sees a weakness in
          his character, it is not enough to confess it again and again; he must go to work with determination and
          energy to overcome his defects by building up opposite traits of character. He will not shun this work because
          it is difﬁcult. Untiring energy is required of the Christian; but he is not obliged to work in his own
          strength; divine power awaits his demand. Everyone who is sincerely striving for the victory over self will
          appropriate the promise, “My grace is sufﬁcient for thee.”</p>
      <p>Through personal effort joined with the prayer of faith the soul is trained. Day by day the character grows
          into the likeness of Christ.... It may cost a severe</p>
      <p>conﬂict to overcome habits which have been long indulged, but we may triumph through the grace of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>If we are true to the promptings of the Spirit of God, we shall go on from grace to grace and from glory to
          glory until we shall receive the ﬁnishing touch of immortality.</p>
