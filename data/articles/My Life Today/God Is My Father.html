      <p><strong>God in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. 1 John
          3:1</p>
      <p>What love, what matchless love, that, sinners and aliens as we are, we may be brought back to God and adopted
          into His family! We may address Him by the endearing name, “Our Father,” which is a sign of our affection for
          Him and a pledge of His tender regard and relationship to us. And the Son of God, beholding the heirs of
          grace, “is not ashamed to call them brethren.” They have even a more sacred relationship to God than have the
          angels who have never fallen.</p>
      <p>All the paternal love which has come down from generation to generation through the channel of human hearts,
          all the springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill to the boundless
          ocean, when compared with the inﬁnite, exhaustless love of God. Tongue cannot utter it; pen cannot portray it.
          You may meditate upon it every day of your life; you may search the Scriptures diligently in order to
          understand it; you may summon every power and capability that God has given you, in the endeavor to comprehend
          the love and compassion of the heavenly Father; and yet there is an inﬁnity beyond.</p>
      <p>In all His children God beholds the image of His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son. He looks upon them with a love
          greater than any language can express. He enfolds them in the arms of His love. The Lord rejoices over His
          people.</p>
      <p>He has redeemed us out of the careless world and has chosen us to become members of the royal family, sons and
          daughters of the heavenly King. He invites us to trust in Him with a trust deeper and stronger than that of a
          child in his earthly father.</p>
      <p>God is to us a tender, compassionate, heavenly Father.</p>
