    <h1>Perfection, the Goal to Be Gained</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Perfection of Character</strong></p>
      <p>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:48</p>
      <p>God will accept only those who are determined to aim high. He places every human agent under obligation to do
          his best. Moral perfection is required of all. Never should we lower the standard of righteousness in order to
          accommodate inherited and cultivated tendencies to wrongdoing. We need to understand that imperfection of
          character is sin. All righteous attributes of character dwell in God as a perfect, harmonious whole, and every
          one who receives Christ as a personal Saviour is privileged to possess these attributes.</p>
      <p>And those who would be workers together with God must strive for perfection of every organ of the body and
          quality of the mind. True education is the preparation of the physical, mental, and moral powers for the
          performance of every duty; it is the training of body, mind, and soul for divine service. This is the
          education that will endure unto eternal life....</p>
      <p>But Christ has given us no assurance that to attain perfection of character is an easy matter. A noble,
          <nobr>all-around</nobr> character is not inherited. It does not come to us by accident. A noble character is
          earned by individual effort through the merits and grace of Christ. God gives the talents, the powers of the
          mind; we form the character. It is formed by hard, stern battles with self. Conﬂict after conﬂict must be
          waged against hereditary tendencies. We shall have to criticize ourselves closely, and allow not one
          unfavorable trait to remain uncorrected.</p>
      <p>Let no one say, I cannot remedy my defects of character.... The real difﬁculty</p>
      <p>arises from the corruption of an unsanctiﬁed heart and an unwillingness to submit to the control of God.</p>
      <p>Subjection to the will of Christ means restoration to perfect manhood.</p>
