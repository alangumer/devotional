      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Being born again ... by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 1 Peter 1:23</p>
      <p>In the Bible the will of God is revealed. The truths of the Word of God are the utterances of the Most High. He
          who makes these truths a part of his life becomes in every sense a new creature. He is not given new mental
          powers, but the darkness that through ignorance and sin has clouded the understanding is removed. The words,
          “A new heart also will I give you,” mean, “A new mind will I give you.” A change of heart is always attended
          by a clear conviction of Christian duty, an understanding of truth. He who gives the Scriptures close,
          prayerful attention will gain clear comprehension and sound judgment, as if in turning to God he had reached a
          higher plane of intelligence.</p>
      <p>The Bible contains the principles that lie at the foundation of all true greatness, all true prosperity,
          whether for the individual or for the nation. The nation that gives free room for the circulation of the
          Scriptures opens the way for the minds of the people to develop and expand. The reading of the Scriptures
          causes light to shine into the darkness. As the Word of God is searched, <nobr>life-giving</nobr> truths are
          found. In the lives of those who heed its teachings there will be an undercurrent of happiness that will bless
          all with whom they are brought in contact.</p>
      <p>Thousands have drawn water from these wells of life, yet there is no diminishing of the supply. Thousands have
          set the Lord before them, and by beholding have been changed into the same image. Their spirit burns within
          them as they speak of His character, telling what Christ is to them and what they are to Christ.... Thousands
          more may engage in the work of searching out the mysteries</p>
      <p>of salvation.... Each fresh search will reveal something more deeply interesting</p>
      <p>than has yet been unfolded.</p>
