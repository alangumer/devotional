      <p><strong>Growing in Wisdom and Knowledge</strong></p>
      <p>I have ﬁlled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner
          of workmanship. Exodus 31:3</p>
      <p>You need not go to the end of the earth for wisdom, for God is near.... He</p>
      <p>longs to have you reach after Him by faith. He longs to have you expect great things from Him. He longs to give
          you understanding in temporal as well as in spiritual matters. He can sharpen the intellect. He can give tact
          and skill. Put your talents into the work, ask God for wisdom, and it will be given you.</p>
      <p>To every one who constantly yields his will to the will of the Inﬁnite, to be led and taught of God, there is
          promised an <nobr>ever-increasing</nobr> development of spiritual things. God ﬁxes no limit to the advancement
          of those who are “ﬁlled with the knowledge of His will and in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”</p>
      <p>Those who make God their efﬁciency realize their own weakness, and the Lord supplies them with His wisdom. As
          day by day they depend upon God, carrying out His will with humility and wholeheartedness and strictest
          integrity, they increase in knowledge and ability. By willing obedience they show reverence and honor to God,
          and are honored by Him.</p>
      <p>The case of Daniel reveals to us the fact that the Lord is always ready to hear the prayers of the contrite
          soul, and when we seek the Lord with all our hearts, He will answer our petitions. Here is revealed where
          Daniel obtained his skill and understanding; and if we will only ask of God wisdom, we may be blessed with
          increased ability and with power from heaven.</p>
