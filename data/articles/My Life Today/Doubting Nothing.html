    <h1>Doubting Nothing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Faith in my Life</strong></p>
      <p>O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? Matthew 14:31</p>
      <p>Life is not all made up of pleasant pastures and cooling streams. Trial and disappointment overtake us;
          privation comes; we are brought into trying places. <nobr>Conscience-stricken,</nobr> we reason that we must
          have walked far away from God, that if we had walked with Him, we should not have suffered so. Doubt and
          despondency crowd into our hearts, and we say, The Lord has failed us, and we are <nobr>ill-used.</nobr> Why
          does He permit us to suffer thus? He cannot love us; if He did He would remove the difﬁculties from our
          path....</p>
      <p>He does not always bring us to pleasant places. If He did, in our <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> we should forget
          that He is our helper. He longs to manifest Himself to us, and to reveal the abundant supplies at our
          disposal, and He permits trial and disappointment to come to us that we may realize our helplessness, and
          learn to call upon Him for aid. He can cause cooling streams to ﬂow from the ﬂinty rock.</p>
      <p>We shall never know until we are face to face with God, when we shall see as we are seen and know as we are
          known, how many burdens He has borne for us, and how many burdens He would have been glad to bear, if with
          childlike faith we had brought them to Him....</p>
      <p>God’s love is revealed in all His dealings with His people; and with clear, unclouded eyes, in adversity, in
          sickness, in disappointment, and in trial we are to behold the light of His glory in the face of Christ and
          trust to His guiding hand. But too often we grieve His heart by our unbelief....</p>
      <p>God loves His children, and He longs to see them overcoming the discouragement with which Satan would overpower
          them. Do not give way to unbelief. Do not magnify your difﬁculties. Remember the love and power that God has
          shown in times past.</p>
