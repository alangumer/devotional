    <h1>I Press Toward the Mark</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>All Life´s Expiriences Will Be Made Plain</strong></p>
      <p>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
          before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Philippians 3:13,
          14</p>
      <p>Another year of your life closes today. How can you look back upon it? Have you made advancement in the divine
          life? Have you increased in spirituality? Have you cruciﬁed self, with the affections and lusts? Have you an
          increased interest in the study of God’s Word? Have you gained decided victories over your own feelings and
          waywardness? Oh, what has been the record of your life for the year which has now passed into eternity, never
          to be recalled?</p>
      <p>As you enter upon a new year, let it be with an earnest resolve to have your course onward and upward. Let your
          life be more elevated and exalted than it has hitherto been. Make it your aim not to seek your own interest
          and pleasure, but to advance the cause of your Redeemer. Remain not in a position where you ever need help
          yourself, and where others have to guard you to keep you in the narrow way. You may be strong to exert a
          sanctifying inﬂuence upon others. You may be where your soul’s interest will be awakened to do good to others,
          to comfort the sorrowful, strengthen the weak, and to bear your testimony for Christ whenever opportunity
          offers. Aim to honor God in everything, always and everywhere. Carry your religion into everything.</p>
      <p>Prepare for eternity with such a zeal as you have not yet manifested. Educate your mind to love the Bible, to
          love the prayer meeting, to love the hour of meditation, and, above all, the hour when the soul communes with
          God. Become <nobr>heavenly-minded</nobr> if you would unite with the heavenly choir in the mansions
          above....</p>
      <p>A new page is turned in the book of the recording angel.... Let a record be</p>
      <p>stamped there which you will not be ashamed to have revealed to the gaze of men and angels.</p>
