      <p><strong>Exercising <nobr>Self-control</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,
          and not to covetousness. Psalm 119:35, 36</p>
      <p>Youth is the time to lay up knowledge in those lines that can be put into daily practice throughout the life.
          Youth is the time to establish good habits, to correct wrong ones, to gain and hold the power of
          <nobr>self-control,</nobr> to accustom oneself to ordering all the acts of life with reference to the will of
          God and the welfare of one’s fellow creatures. Youth is the sowing time that determines the harvest of this
          life and the life beyond the grave. The habits formed in childhood and youth, the tastes acquired, the
          <nobr>self-control</nobr> gained, are almost certain to determine the future of the man or woman.</p>
      <p>One selﬁsh thought indulged, one duty neglected, prepares the way for another. What we venture to do once, we
          are more apt to do again. Habits of sobriety, of <nobr>self-control,</nobr> of economy, of close application,
          of sound, sensible conversation, of patience and true courtesy, are not gained without diligent, close
          watching over self. It is much easier to become demoralized and depraved than to conquer defects, keeping self
          in control and cherishing true virtues. Persevering efforts will be required if the Christian graces are ever
          perfected in our lives.</p>
      <p>Let the habit of <nobr>self-control</nobr> be early established. Let the youth be impressed with the thought
          that they are to be masters, and not slaves. Of the kingdom within them God has made them rulers, and they are
          to exercise their <nobr>Heaven-appointed</nobr> kingship. When such instruction is faithfully given, the
          results will extend far beyond the youth themselves. Inﬂuences will reach out that will save thousands of men
          and women who are on the very brink of ruin.</p>
