    <h1>Victory Over Death</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ Redeems Me Unto Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
          crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. Revelation 21:4</p>
      <p>We have a living, risen Saviour. He burst the fetters of the tomb after He had lain there three days, and in
          triumph He proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, “I am the resurrection, and the life.” And He is
          coming. Are we getting ready for Him? Are we ready so that if we shall fall asleep, we can do so with hope in
          Jesus Christ? ...</p>
      <p>The <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> is soon to come ... to break the fetters of the tomb. He is to bring forth the
          captives.... The last thoughts they had were of the grave and the</p>
      <p>tomb, but now they proclaim, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” The pangs of death
          were the last things they felt.... When they awake</p>
      <p>the pain is all gone. “O grave, where is thy victory?” Here they stand, and the ﬁnishing touch of immortality
          is put upon them, and they go up to meet their Lord in the air. The gates of the city of God swing back upon
          their hinges, ... and the ransomed of God walk in through the cherubims and seraphims. Christ bids them
          welcome and puts upon them His benediction. “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into
          the joy of thy Lord.” What is that joy? He sees of the travail of his soul, and is satisﬁed.... Here is one
          who in the night season we</p>
      <p>pleaded with God on his behalf. There is one that we talked with on his dying bed, and he hung his helpless
          soul upon Jesus. Here is one who was a poor drunkard. We tried to get his eyes ﬁxed upon Him who is mighty to
          save, and we told him that Christ could give him the victory. There are the crowns of immortal glory upon
          their heads.</p>
      <p>There, there is no disappointment, no sorrow, no sin, no one who shall say, “I am sick.” There, there is no
          burial train, no mourning, no death, no parting, no broken hearts; and Jesus is there, peace is there.... In
          His presence is fullness of</p>
      <p>joy, at His right hand there are pleasures forevermore!</p>
