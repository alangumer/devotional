      <p><strong>Improving My Talents</strong></p>
      <p>Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler
          over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew 25:21</p>
      <p>God has given us talents to use for Him. To one He gives ﬁve talents, to another two, and to another one. Let
          not him who has but one talent think to hide it from God. The Lord knows where it is hidden. He knows that it
          is doing nothing for Him. When the Lord comes, He will ask His servants, What have you done with the talents I
          entrusted to you? And as he who received ﬁve and he who received two tell Him that by trading they have
          doubled their talents, He will say to them, “Well done, good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful
          over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.... Enter thou into the joy of thy</p>
      <p>Lord.” Thus He will say also to him who has improved the one talent lent him....</p>
      <p>To him who has but one talent I would say, Do you know that one talent, rightly used and improved, will bring
          to the Lord one hundred talents? How? you ask. Use your gift in the conversion of one man of intellect, who
          sees what God is to him, and what he should be to God. Let him place himself on the side of the Lord, and as
          he imparts the light to others, he will be the means of bringing many souls to the Saviour. Through the right
          use of one talent one hundred souls may receive the truth. It is not to those who have the greatest number of
          talents to whom the “Well done” is spoken, but to those who in sincerity and faithfulness have used their
          gifts for the Master....</p>
      <p>There is a great work to be done in our world, and we are accountable for every ray of light that shines upon
          our pathway. Impart that light, and you will receive more light to impart. Great blessing will come to those
          who use their talents aright.</p>
