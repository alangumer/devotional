    <h1>For the Perfecting of the Saints</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the
          perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all
          come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
          of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephesians <nobr>4:11-13</nobr></p>
      <p>All these gifts are to be in exercise. Every faithful worker will minister for the perfecting of the saints....
          There is something for everyone to do. Every soul</p>
      <p>that believes the truth is to stand in his lot and place, saying: “Here am I; send me.” ... Give each one
          something to do for others. Help all to see that as receivers of the grace of Christ they are under obligation
          to work for Him. And let all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly come to the faith be
          educated to become laborers together with God. If set to work, the despondent will soon forget their
          despondency; the weak will become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will be prepared to present the
          truth as it is in Jesus. They will ﬁnd an unfailing helper in Him who has promised to save all that come unto
          Him.</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit is needed that the work may be properly balanced and that it may move forward
          solidly in every line.</p>
      <p>The truth for this time embraces the whole gospel. Rightly presented, it will work in man the very changes that
          will make evident the power of God’s grace upon the heart. It will do a complete work and develop a complete
          man.</p>
      <p>He [God] tells us to be perfect as He <nobr>is–in</nobr> the same manner. We are to be centers of light and
          blessing to our little circle, even as He is to the universe. We have nothing of ourselves, but the light of
          His love shines upon us, and we are to reﬂect its brightness.... We may be perfect in our sphere, even as God
          is perfect in</p>
      <p>His.</p>
