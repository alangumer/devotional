    <h1>Paul’s Shout of Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Those Who Have Conquered</strong></p>
      <p>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
          nakedness, or peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved
          us. Romans <nobr>8:35-37</nobr></p>
      <p>Paul suffered for the truth’s sake, and yet we hear no complaints from his lips. As he reviews his life of toil
          and care and sacriﬁce, he says, “I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
          compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” The shout of victory from God’s faithful servant comes
          down the line to our time: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or
          persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things we are more than
          conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
          principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
          creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</p>
      <p>Though Paul was at last conﬁned in a Roman <nobr>prison–shut</nobr> away from the light and air of heaven, cut
          off from his active labors in the gospel, and momentarily expecting to be condemned to <nobr>death–yet</nobr>
          he did not yield to doubt or despondency. From that gloomy dungeon came his dying testimony, full of sublime
          faith and courage that has inspired the hearts of saints and martyrs in all succeeding ages. His words ﬁtly
          describe the results of ... sanctiﬁcation.... “I am now ready to be</p>
      <p>offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good ﬁght, I have ﬁnished my course, I have
          kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
          judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.”</p>
      <p>The wounds and scars of our warfare will be to us, as to Paul, the trophies of victory.</p>
