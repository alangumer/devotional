      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11:28</p>
      <p>God’s healing power runs all through nature. If a tree is cut, if a human being is wounded or breaks a bone,
          nature begins at once to repair the injury. Even before the need exists, the healing agencies are in
          readiness; and as soon as a part is wounded, every energy is bent to the work of restoration. So it is in the
          spiritual realm. Before sin created the need, God had provided the remedy. Every soul that yields to
          temptation is wounded, bruised, by the adversary; but wherever there is sin, there is the Saviour.</p>
      <p>When the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is a cure for the maladies that originated in sin. The
          Sun of Righteousness arises, “with healing in His wings.” ...</p>
      <p>The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is a vitalizing power. Every vital <nobr>part–the</nobr>
          brain, the heart, the <nobr>nerves–it</nobr> touches with healing. By it the highest energies of the being are
          roused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt and sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life
          forces. With it come serenity and composure. It implants in the soul joy that nothing earthly can
          <nobr>destroy–joy</nobr> in the Holy <nobr>Spirit–health-giving,</nobr><nobr>life-giving</nobr> joy.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour’s words, “Come unto Me, ... and I will give you rest,” are a prescription for the healing of
          physical, mental, and spiritual ills. Though men have brought suffering upon themselves by their own
          wrongdoing He regards them with pity. In Him they may ﬁnd help. He will do great things for those who trust in
          Him....</p>
      <p>If human beings would open the windows of the soul heavenward, in appreciation of the divine gifts, a ﬂood of
          healing virtue would ﬂow in.</p>
