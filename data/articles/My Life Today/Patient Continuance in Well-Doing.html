      <p><strong>Highways to Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty
          of man. Ecclesiastes 12:13</p>
      <p>He [Solomon] gives us the history of his search for happiness. He engaged in intellectual pursuits; he gratiﬁed
          his love for pleasure; he carried out his schemes of commercial enterprise. He was surrounded by the
          fascinating splendor of court life....</p>
      <p>Solomon sat upon a throne of ivory, the steps of which were of solid gold, ﬂanked by six golden lions. His eyes
          rested upon highly cultivated and beautiful gardens just before him. These grounds were visions of loveliness,
          arranged to resemble, as far as possible, the Garden of Eden. Choice trees and shrubs and ﬂowers of every
          variety had been brought from foreign lands to beautify them. Birds of every variety of brilliant plumage
          ﬂitted from tree to tree, making the air vocal with sweet songs. Youthful attendants, gorgeously dressed and
          decorated, waited to obey his slightest wish. Scenes of revelry, music, sports, and games were arranged for
          his diversion at an extravagant expenditure of money.</p>
      <p>But all this did not bring happiness to the king.... Dissipation had left its</p>
      <p>impress upon his once fair and intellectual face. He was sadly changed from the youthful Solomon. His brow was
          furrowed with care and unhappiness.... His lips</p>
      <p>were prepared to break forth into reproaches at the slightest deviation from his wishes.</p>
      <p>His shattered nerves and wasted frame showed the result of violating Nature’s laws. He confessed to a wasted
          life, an unsuccessful chase after happiness.</p>
      <p>The way to true happiness remains the same in all ages. Patient continuance in <nobr>well-doing</nobr> will
          lead to honor, happiness, and eternal life.</p>
