      <p><strong>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>The just shall live by his faith. Habakkuk 2:4</p>
      <p>On one occasion, when meditating concerning the future, he [Habakkuk] said, “I will stand upon my watch, and
          set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what He will say unto me.” Graciously the Lord answered him:
          “Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.... The just shall live</p>
      <p>by his faith.”</p>
      <p>The faith that strengthened Habakkuk and all the holy and the just in those days of deep trial was the same
          faith that sustains God’s people today. In the darkest hours, under circumstances the most forbidding, the
          Christian believer may keep his soul stayed upon the source of all light and power. Day by day, through faith
          in God, his hope and courage may be renewed. “The just shall live by his faith.” In the service of God there
          need be no despondency, no wavering, no fear. The Lord will more than fulﬁll the highest expectations of those
          who put their trust in Him. He will give them the wisdom their varied necessities demand....</p>
      <p>We must cherish and cultivate the faith of which prophets and apostles have <nobr>testiﬁed–the</nobr> faith
          that lays hold on the promises of God and waits for deliverance in His appointed time and way. The sure word
          of prophecy will meet its ﬁnal fulﬁllment in the glorious Advent of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as King
          of kings and Lord of lords. The time of waiting may seem long, the soul may be oppressed by discouraging
          circumstances, many in whom conﬁdence has been placed may fall by the way; but with the prophet who endeavored
          to encourage Judah in a time of unparalleled apostasy, let us conﬁdently declare, “The Lord is in His holy
          temple: let all the earth keep silence before Him.” Let us ever hold in remembrance the cheering message, “The
          vision is yet for an appointed time ... : though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will
          not tarry.... The just</p>
      <p>shall live by his faith.”</p>
