      <p>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. I am
          distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful,
          passing the love of women. 2 Samuel 1:25, 26</p>
      <p>The friendship of Jonathan for David was ... of God’s providence, to preserve the life of the future ruler of
          Israel.</p>
      <p>At this time, when there were so few bright spots in the path of David, he was rejoiced to receive an
          unexpected visit from Jonathan, who had learned the place of his refuge. Precious were the moments which these
          two friends passed in each other’s society. They related their varied experiences, and Jonathan strengthened
          the heart of David, saying, “Fear not! for the hand of Saul my father shall not ﬁnd thee; and thou shalt be
          king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.” As they talked of the
          wonderful dealings of God with David, the hunted fugitive was greatly encouraged. “And they two made a
          covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.”</p>
      <p>After the visit of Jonathan, David encouraged his soul with songs of praise, accompanying his voice with his
          harp.</p>
      <p>Jonathan, by birth heir to the throne, yet knowing himself set aside by the divine decree; to his rival the
          most tender and faithful of friends, shielding David’s life at the peril of his own; steadfast at his father’s
          side through the dark days of his declining power, and at his side falling at the <nobr>last–the</nobr> name
          of Jonathan is treasured in heaven, and it stands on earth a witness to the existence and the power of
          unselﬁsh love.</p>
