      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his beneﬁts: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all
          thy diseases. Psalm 103:2, 3</p>
      <p>The Saviour ministered to both the soul and the body. The gospel which He taught was a message of spiritual
          life and of physical restoration. Deliverance from sin and healing of disease were linked together. The same
          ministry is committed to the Christian physician. He is to unite with Christ in relieving both the physical
          and spiritual needs of his fellow men. He is to be to the sick a messenger of mercy, bringing to them a remedy
          for the diseased body and for the <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> soul.</p>
      <p>When the poor paralytic was brought to the house where Jesus was teaching, a dense crowd surrounded the door,
          barring every way of access to the Saviour. But faith and hope had been kindled in the heart of the poor
          sufferer, and he proposed that his friends take him to the rear of the house, break up the roof, and let him
          down into the presence of Christ. The suggestion was acted upon; as the afﬂicted one lay at the feet of the
          mighty Healer, all that man could do for his restoration had been done. Jesus knew that the sufferer had been
          tortured with a sense of his sins, and that he must ﬁrst ﬁnd relief from this burden. With a look of tenderest
          compassion, the Saviour addressed him, not as a stranger, or even a friend, but as one who had even then been
          received into the family of God: “Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.”</p>
      <p>Many are suffering from maladies of the soul far more than from diseases of the body, and they will ﬁnd no
          relief until they shall come to Christ, the wellspring of life. Complaints of weariness, loneliness, and
          dissatisfaction will then cease. Satisfying joys will give vigor to the mind and health and vital energy to
          the body.</p>
      <p>Today Christ is feeling the woes of every sufferer.... He knows how to speak</p>
      <p>the word, “Be whole,” and bid the sufferer, “Go, and sin no more.”</p>
