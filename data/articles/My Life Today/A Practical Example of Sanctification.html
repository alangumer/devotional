    <h1>A Practical Example of Sanctiﬁcation</h1>

      <p><strong>Sanctiﬁcation</strong></p>
      <p>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might
          sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious
          church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
          Ephesians <nobr>5:25-27</nobr></p>
      <p>Here is Bible sanctiﬁcation. It is not merely a show or outside work. It is sanctiﬁcation received through the
          channel of truth. It is truth received in the heart and practically carried out in the life.</p>
      <p>Jesus, considered as a man, was perfect, yet He grew in grace. Luke 2:52: “And Jesus increased in wisdom and
          stature, and in favour with God and man.” Even the most perfect Christian may increase continually in the
          knowledge and love of God....</p>
      <p>“But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and
          forever. Amen.”</p>
      <p>Sanctiﬁcation is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a day. It is a continual growth in grace. We know not
          one day how strong will be our conﬂict the next. Satan lives, and is active, and every day we need to cry
          earnestly to God for help and strength to resist him. As long as Satan reigns we shall have self to subdue,
          besetments to overcome, and there is no stopping place, there is no point to which we can come and say we have
          fully attained....</p>
      <p>The Christian life is constantly an onward march. Jesus sits as a reﬁner and puriﬁer of His people; and when
          His image is perfectly reﬂected in them, they are perfect and holy, and prepared for translation.</p>
      <p>Every living Christian will advance daily in the divine life. As he advances toward perfection, he experiences
          a conversion to God every day; and this conversion is not completed until he attains to perfection of
          Christian character, a full preparation for the ﬁnishing touch of immortality.</p>
