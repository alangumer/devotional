      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>Seeing ye have puriﬁed your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren,
          see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. 1 Peter 1:22</p>
      <p>The lily on the lake strikes its roots down deep beneath the surface of rubbish and slime, and through its
          porous stem draws those properties that will aid its development and bring to light its spotless blossom to
          repose in purity on the bosom of the lake.</p>
      <p>It refuses all that would tarnish and mar its spotless beauty.... Let the youth</p>
      <p>be found in association with those who fear and love God; for these noble, ﬁrm characters are represented by
          the lily that opens its pure blossom on the bosom of the lake. They refuse to be molded by the inﬂuences that
          would demoralize, and gather to themselves only that which will aid the development of a pure and noble
          character. They are seeking to be conformed to the divine model.</p>
      <p>In the estimation of God a pure heart is more precious than the gold of Ophir. A pure heart is the temple where
          God dwells, the sanctuary where Christ takes up his abode. A pure heart is above everything that is cheap or
          low; it is a shining light, a treasure house from which come uplifting, sanctiﬁed words. It is a place where
          the imagery of God is recognized, and where the highest delight is to behold his image. It is a heart that
          ﬁnds its whole and only pleasure and satisfaction in God, and whose thoughts and intents and purposes are
          alive with godliness. Such a heart is a sacred place; it is a treasury of all virtue....</p>
      <p>The very thoughts of those whose hearts are pure are brought into captivity to Christ. They are occupied with
          thinking how they can best glorify God.</p>
      <p>It will then be as natural for us to seek purity and holiness... as it is for the angels of glory to execute
          the mission of love assigned to them.</p>
