      <p>Use hospitality one to another without grudging. As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
          one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 1 Peter 4:9, 10</p>
      <p>When the spirit of hospitality dies, the heart becomes palsied with selﬁshness. “A lover of hospitality” is
          among the speciﬁcations given by the Holy Spirit as marking one who is to bear responsibility in the church.
          And to the whole church is given the injunction: “Use hospitality one to another without grudging....” 1</p>
      <p>Peter 4:9, 10.</p>
      <p>These admonitions have been strangely neglected. Even among those who profess to be Christians, true
          hospitality is little exercised. Among our own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is not regarded
          as it should be, as a privilege and blessing. There is altogether too little sociability, too little of a
          disposition to make room for two or three more at the family board, without embarrassment or parade. Some
          plead that “it is too much trouble.” It would not be if you would say: “We have made no special preparation,
          but you are welcome to what we have.” By the unexpected guest a welcome is appreciated far more than is the
          most elaborate preparation....</p>
      <p>Christ keeps an account of every expense incurred in entertaining for His sake. He supplies all that is
          necessary for this work. Those who for Christ’s sake entertain their brethren, doing their best to make the
          visit proﬁtable both to their guests and to themselves, are recorded in heaven as worthy of special
          blessings.</p>
      <p>As you open your door to Christ’s needy and suffering ones, you are welcoming unseen angels. You invite the
          companionship of heavenly beings. They bring a sacred atmosphere of joy and peace. They come with praises upon
          their lips, and an answering strain is heard in heaven. Every deed of mercy makes music there.</p>
