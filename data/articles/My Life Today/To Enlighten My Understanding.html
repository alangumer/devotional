      <p><strong>The Work of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
          the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of
          his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. Ephesians 1:17, 18</p>
      <p>For the mind renewed by the Holy Spirit, divine beauty and celestial light shine from the sacred page. That
          which is to the earthly mind a desolate wilderness, to the spiritual mind becomes a land of living
          streams.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy to be understood, or prevent us
          from wresting truths difﬁcult of comprehension. It is the ofﬁce of heavenly angels to prepare the heart so to
          comprehend God’s Word that we shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and
          strengthened by its promises. We should make the psalmist’s petition our own, “Open Thou mine eyes, that I may
          behold wondrous things out of Thy law.”</p>
      <p>God’s holy, educating Spirit is in His Word. A light, a new and precious light, shines forth from every page.
          Truth is there revealed, and words and sentences are made bright and appropriate for the occasion, as the
          voice of God speaking to them.</p>
      <p>We need to recognize the Holy Spirit as our enlightener. That Spirit loves to address the children, and
          discover to them the treasures and beauties of the Word. The promises spoken by our Great Teacher will
          captivate the senses and animate the soul of the child with a spiritual power that is divine. There will grow
          in the receptive mind a familiarity with divine things which will be as a barricade against the temptations of
          the enemy.... The sparks of heavenly love will fall upon</p>
      <p>the hearts of the children as an inspiration.</p>
