      <p><strong>Exercising <nobr>Self-control</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Blessed art thou, O land, when ... thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
          Ecclesiastes 10:17</p>
      <p>The observance of temperance and regularity in all things has a wonderful power. It will do more than
          circumstances or natural endowments in promoting that sweetness and serenity of disposition which count so
          much in smoothing life’s pathway. At the same time the power of <nobr>self-control</nobr> thus acquired will
          be found one of the most valuable equipments for grappling successfully with the stern duties and realities
          that await every human being.</p>
      <p>We urge that the principles of temperance be carried into all the details of home life; ... that
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-control</nobr> should be taught to the children, and enforced upon
          them, so far as consistent, from babyhood.</p>
      <p>Children should be taught that they must not have their own way, but that the will of their parents must guide
          them. One of the most important lessons in this connection is the control of appetite. They should learn to
          eat at regular periods and to allow nothing to pass their lips between these stated meals....</p>
      <p>Children reared in this way are much more easily controlled than those who are indulged in eating everything
          their appetite craves, and at all times. They are usually cheerful, contented, and healthy. Even the most
          stubborn, passionate, and wayward have become submissive, patient, and possessed of <nobr>self-control</nobr>
          by persistently following up this order of diet, united with a ﬁrm but kind management in regard to other
          matters.</p>
      <p>Let every youth in our land, with the possibilities before him of a destiny higher than that of crowned kings,
          ponder the lesson conveyed in the words of the wise man, “Blessed art thou, O land, when ... thy princes eat
          in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!”</p>
