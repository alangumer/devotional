    <h1>Reverence for the House of God</h1>

      <p><strong>Reverence in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord. Leviticus 19:30</p>
      <p>God is high and holy; and to the humble, believing soul, His house on earth, the place where His people meet
          for worship, is as the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the words spoken by Christ’s ministers, are God’s
          appointed agencies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier worship.</p>
      <p>When the worshipers enter the place of meeting, they should do so with decorum, passing quietly to their
          seats.... Common talking, whispering, and</p>
      <p>laughing should not be permitted in the house of worship, either before or after the service. Ardent, active
          piety should characterize the worshipers.</p>
      <p>If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting begins, let them maintain a true spirit of devotion by
          silent meditation, keeping the heart uplifted to God in prayer that the service may be of special beneﬁt to
          their own hearts and lead to the conviction and conversion of other souls. They should remember that heavenly
          messengers are in the house. We all lose much sweet communion with God by our restlessness, by not encouraging
          moments of reﬂection and prayer....</p>
      <p>Elevate the standard of Christianity in the minds of your children; help them to weave Jesus into their
          experience; teach them to have the highest reverence for the house of God and to understand that when they
          enter the Lord’s house it should be with hearts that are softened and subdued by such thoughts as these: “God
          is here; this is His house. I must have pure thoughts and holiest motives....</p>
      <p>This is the place where God meets with and blesses His people.” ...</p>
      <p>Parents should not only teach, but command, their children to enter the sanctuary with sobriety and
          reverence.</p>
      <p>Practice reverence until it becomes a part of yourself.</p>
