    <h1>Christ Presents Me With a Crown and Harp</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ Redeems Me Unto Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
          at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 2 Timothy 4:8</p>
      <p>Before entering the city of God the Saviour bestows upon His followers the emblems of victory and invests them
          with the insignia of their royal state. The glittering ranks are drawn up in the form of a hollow square about
          their King, whose form rises in majesty high above saint and angel, whose countenance beams upon them full of
          benignant love. Throughout the unnumbered host of the redeemed every glance is ﬁxed upon Him, every eye
          beholds His glory whose “visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.” Upon
          the heads of the overcomers Jesus with His own right hand places the crown of glory. For each there is a
          crown, bearing his own “new name,” and the inscription, “Holiness to the Lord.” In every hand are placed the
          victor’s palm and the shining harp. Then, as the commanding angels strike the note, every hand sweeps the harp
          strings with skillful touch, awaking sweet music in rich, melodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills every
          heart, and each voice is raised in grateful praise: “Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
          His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion for
          ever and ever.”</p>
      <p>Oh, what joy unspeakable, to see Him whom we <nobr>loved–to</nobr> see Him in His glory who so loved us that He
          gave Himself for <nobr>us–to</nobr> behold those hands once pierced for our redemption stretched out to us in
          blessing and welcome!</p>
      <p>Those who ... place themselves in God’s hands ... will see the King in His beauty. They will behold His
          matchless charms, and touching their golden harps, they will ﬁll all heaven with rich music and with songs to
          the Lamb.</p>
