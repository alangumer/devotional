      <p><strong>Sanctifying Power of the Truth</strong></p>
      <p>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. John 17:17</p>
      <p>The truth of God is to sanctify the soul. “A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
          you.” The sanctifying power of truth is to abide in the soul and be carried with us to our business, there to
          apply its continual tests to every transaction of life, especially to our dealings with our fellow men. It is
          to abide in our households, having a subduing power upon the life and character of all its inmates.</p>
      <p>I must ever urge upon those who profess to believe the truth the necessity of practicing the truth. This means
          sanctiﬁcation, and sanctiﬁcation means the culture and training of every capability for the Lord’s
          service.</p>
      <p>Teach your children to love the truth because it is the truth and because they are to be sanctiﬁed through the
          truth and ﬁtted to stand in the grand review that shall erelong determine whether they are qualiﬁed to enter
          into higher work, and become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King.</p>
      <p>The truth, the precious truth of God’s Word, will have a sanctifying effect upon the heart and character. There
          is work to be done for ourselves and for our children. The natural heart is full of hatred to the truth, as it
          is to Jesus. Unless parents shall make it the ﬁrst business of their lives to guide their children’s feet into
          the path of righteousness from their earliest years, the wrong path will be chosen before the right.</p>
      <p>The work of sanctiﬁcation begins in the home. Those who are Christians in the home will be Christians in the
          church and in the world.</p>
