      <p><strong>Respect For Parents</strong></p>
      <p>Respect in My Life</p>
      <p>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
          Exodus 20:12</p>
      <p>The best way to educate children to respect their father and mother is to give them the opportunity of seeing
          the father offering kindly attentions to the mother, and the mother rendering respect and reverence to the
          father. It is by beholding love in their parents that children are led to obey the ﬁfth commandment....</p>
      <p>Our obligation to our parents never ceases. Our love for them, and theirs for us, is not measured by years or
          distance, and our responsibility can never be set aside. When the nations are gathered before the judgment
          seat of Christ, but two classes will be <nobr>represented–those</nobr> who have identiﬁed their interest with
          Christ and suffering humanity; those who have ignored their <nobr>God-given</nobr> obligations, done injury to
          their fellow men, and dishonor to God. Their eternal destiny will be decided on the ground of what they did
          and what they did not do to Christ in the person of His saints.</p>
      <p>Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due to no other person.... The ﬁfth commandment
          requires children not only to yield respect,</p>
      <p>submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and tenderness, to lighten their cares,
          to guard their reputation, and to succor and comfort them in old age.</p>
      <p>While the parents live it should be the children’s joy to honor and respect them. They should bring all the
          cheerfulness and sunshine into the life of the aged parents that they possibly can. They should smooth their
          pathway to the grave. There is no better recommendation in this world than that a child has honored his
          parents, no better record in the books of heaven than that he has loved and honored father and mother.</p>
