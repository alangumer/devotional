    <h1>One with God Through Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Faith in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. John
          17:21</p>
      <p>“I am the vine, ye are the branches.” Can we conceive of a more intimate relation to Christ than this? The
          ﬁbers of the branch are almost identical with those of the vine. The communication of life, strength, and
          fruitfulness from the trunk to the branches is unobstructed and constant. The root sends its nourishment
          through the branch. Such is the true believer’s relation to Christ. He abides in Christ, and draws his
          nourishment from Him.</p>
      <p>This spiritual relation can be established only by the exercise of personal faith. This faith must express on
          our part supreme preference, perfect reliance, entire consecration. Our will must be wholly yielded to the
          divine will; our feelings, desires, interests, and honor, identiﬁed with the prosperity of Christ’s kingdom
          and the honor of His cause, we constantly receiving grace from Him, and Christ accepting gratitude from
          us.</p>
      <p>When the intimacy of connection and communion is formed, our sins are laid upon Christ, His righteousness is
          imputed to us. He was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. We have access
          to God through Him; we are accepted through the Beloved. Whoever by word or deed injures a believer, thereby
          wounds Jesus. Whoever gives a cup of cold water to a disciple because he is a child of God, will be regarded
          by Christ as giving to Himself.</p>
      <p>It was when Christ was about to take leave of His disciples that He gave them the beautiful emblem of His
          relation to believers.... A union with Christ by living</p>
      <p>faith is enduring; every other union must perish.... The true believer chooses</p>
      <p>Christ as ﬁrst and last, and best in everything.</p>
