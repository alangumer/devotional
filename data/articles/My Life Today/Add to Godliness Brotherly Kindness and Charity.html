      <p>But thou, O man of God, ... follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 1 Timothy
          6:11</p>
      <p>We must have a close and intimate connection with heaven, if we bear the grace of godliness. Jesus must be a
          guest in our homes, a member of our households, if we reﬂect His image and show that we are sons and daughters
          of the Most High. Religion is a beautiful thing in the home. If the Lord abides with us, we shall feel that we
          are members of Christ’s family in heaven. We shall realize that angels are watching us, and our manners will
          be gentle and forbearing. We shall be ﬁtting up for an entrance into the courts of heaven by cultivating
          courtesy and godliness....</p>
      <p>Enoch walked with God. He honored God in every affair of life. In his home and in his business he inquired,
          “Will this be acceptable to the Lord?” And by remembering God and following His counsel, he was transformed in
          character, and became a godly man, whose ways pleased the Lord. We are exhorted to add to godliness, brotherly
          kindness. O how much we need to take this step, to add this quality to our characters! ... We should have that
          love for others that Christ has had for us. A man is estimated at his true value by the Lord of heaven. If he
          is unkind in his earthly home, he is unﬁt for the heavenly home. If he will have his own way, no matter whom
          it grieves, he would not be content in heaven, unless he could rule there. The love of Christ must control our
          hearts.... Seek God with</p>
      <p>a broken and contrite spirit, and you will be melted with compassion toward your brethren. You will be prepared
          to add to brotherly kindness, charity, or love....</p>
      <p>It will bring heaven nearer to us. We may have the sweet peace and consolation of God in doing this work. These
          steps will take us into the atmosphere of heaven.</p>
