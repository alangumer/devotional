      <p><strong>Growing in Wisdom and Knowledge</strong></p>
      <p>My son, ... keep sound wisdom and discretion: so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. Then
          shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. Proverbs <nobr>3:21-23</nobr></p>
      <p>As little children we are to sit at the feet of Christ, learning of Him how to work successfully. We are to ask
          God for sound judgment and for light to impart to others. There is need of knowledge that is the fruit of
          experience. We should not allow a day to pass without gaining an increase of knowledge in temporal and
          spiritual things. We are to plant no stakes that we are not willing to take up and plant further on, nearer
          the heights we hope to ascend. The highest education is to be found in training the mind to advance day by
          day. The close of each day should ﬁnd us a day’s march nearer the overcomer’s reward. Day by day our
          understanding is to ripen. Day by day we are to work out conclusions that will bring a rich reward in this
          life and in the life to come. Looking daily to Jesus, instead of to what we ourselves have done, we shall make
          decided advancement in temporal as well as spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p>The end of all things is at hand. What we have done must not be allowed to place the period to our work. The
          Captain of our salvation says, “Advance. The night cometh, in which no man can work.” Constantly we are to
          increase in usefulness. Our lives are always to be under the power of Christ. Our lamps are to be kept burning
          brightly....</p>
      <p>In all ages God has given human beings divine revelations, that thus He may fulﬁll His purpose of unfolding
          gradually to the mind the doctrines of grace. His manner of imparting the truth is illustrated by the words,
          “His going forth is prepared as the morning.” He who places himself where God can enlighten him, advances, as
          it were, from the partial obscurity of dawn to the full radiance of noonday.</p>
