      <p><strong>Keeping Physically Fit</strong></p>
      <p>I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth
          right well. Psalm 139:14</p>
      <p>The mechanism of the human body cannot be fully understood; it presents mysteries that bafﬂe the most
          intelligent. It is not as the result of a mechanism, which, once set in motion, continues its work, that the
          pulse beats, and breath follows breath.... The beating heart, the throbbing pulse, every nerve and muscle</p>
      <p>in the living organism, is kept in order and activity by the power of an <nobr>ever-present</nobr> God.</p>
      <p>The Creator of man has arranged the living machinery of our bodies. Every function is wonderfully and wisely
          made. And God has pledged Himself to keep this human machinery in healthful action if the human agent will
          obey His laws and cooperate with God. Every law governing the human machinery is to be considered just as
          truly divine in origin, in character, and in importance as the Word of God. Every careless, inattentive
          action, any abuse put upon the Lord’s wonderful mechanism, by disregarding His speciﬁed laws in the human
          habitation, is a violation of God’s law. We may behold and admire the work of God in the natural world, but
          the human habitation is the most wonderful.</p>
      <p>This living machinery is to be understood. Every part of its wonderful mechanism is to be carefully
          studied.</p>
      <p>As in the study of physiology they see that they are indeed “fearfully and wonderfully made,” they will be
          inspired with reverence. Instead of marring God’s handiwork, they will have an ambition to make all that is
          possible of themselves, in order to fulﬁll the Creator’s glorious plan. Thus they will come to regard
          obedience to the laws of health, not as a matter of sacriﬁce or <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> but as it really is,
          an inestimable privilege and blessing.</p>
