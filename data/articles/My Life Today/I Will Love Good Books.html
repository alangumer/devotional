      <p><strong>Guarding the Avenues to the Soul</strong></p>
      <p>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 1 Timothy 4:13</p>
      <p>God has given to His people the choicest reading matter. Let the Word of God ﬁnd a place in every room in the
          house. Keep the Bible, the bread of life, in plain sight. Let the money spent for magazines be spent instead
          for publications containing present truth, and let them be given a prominent place in the home. With all
          safety these may be placed before the children and youth. Novels should not ﬁnd a place in the homes of those
          who believe in Christ. Do not keep before the youth that which is represented as wood, hay, and stubble, for
          it will poison the appetite for that which is represented as gold, silver, and precious stones. The
          inclination for light, trashy reading is to be strictly denied.</p>
      <p>Keep choice, elevating literature ever before the members of the family. Read our books and papers. Study them.
          Become familiar with the truths they contain. As you do this, you will feel the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit.
          Every moment of life is precious, and should be spent in preparing for the future immortal life. Let the mind
          be stored with the elevating, ennobling themes of the Word of God, that you may be ready to speak a word in
          season to those who come within the sphere of your inﬂuence. The reading of our publications will not make us
          mental dyspeptics. None of us will receive the bread of life to our injury, but as these books are read, the
          mind will be furnished with that which will establish the heart in the truth.</p>
      <p>We must prepare ourselves for most solemn duties. A world is to be saved....</p>
      <p>In view of the great work to be done, how can anyone afford to waste precious time and <nobr>God-given</nobr>
          means in doing those things that are not for his best good or for the glory of God?</p>
