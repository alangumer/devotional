      <p><strong>Elements of Good Health</strong></p>
      <p>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 1 Corinthians 3:16</p>
      <p>God has given you a habitation to care for and preserve in the best condition for His service and glory. Your
          bodies are not your own.... “Know ye not that ye</p>
      <p>are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”</p>
      <p>Health is a blessing of which few appreciate the value.... Life is a holy trust,</p>
      <p>which God alone can enable us to keep, and to use to His glory. But He who formed the wonderful structure of
          the body will take special care to keep it in order if men do not work at <nobr>cross-purposes</nobr> with
          Him. Every talent entrusted to us He will help us to improve and use in accordance to the will of the
          Giver.</p>
      <p>Youth is the time to establish good habits, to correct wrong ones already contracted, to gain and to hold the
          power of <nobr>self-control,</nobr> and to lay the plan, and accustom one’s self to the practice of ordering
          all the acts of life with reference to the will of God.</p>
      <p>The sacred temple of the body must be kept pure and uncontaminated, that God’s Holy Spirit may dwell therein.
          We need to guard faithfully the Lord’s property, for any abuse of our powers shortens the time that our lives
          could be used for the glory of God. Bear in mind that we must consecrate <nobr>all–soul,</nobr> body, and
          <nobr>spirit–to</nobr> God. All is His purchased possession, and must be used intelligently, to the end that
          we may preserve the talent of life. By properly using our powers to their fullest extent in the most useful
          employment, by keeping every organ in health, by so preserving every organ that mind, sinew, and muscle shall
          work harmoniously, we may do the most precious service for God.</p>
      <p>When we do all we can on our part to have health, then may we expect that the blessed results will follow, and
          we can ask God in faith to bless our efforts for the preservation of health.</p>
