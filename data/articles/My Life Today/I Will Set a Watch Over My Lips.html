      <p><strong>Exercising <nobr>Self-control</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. Psalm 141:3</p>
      <p>In the use of language there is perhaps no error that old and young are more ready to pass over lightly in
          themselves than hasty, impatient speech. They think it is a sufﬁcient excuse to plead, “I was off my guard,
          and did not really mean what I said.” But God’s Word does not treat it lightly....</p>
      <p>The largest share of life’s annoyances, its heartaches, its irritations, is due to uncontrolled temper. In one
          moment, by hasty, passionate, careless words, may be wrought evil that a whole lifetime’s repentance cannot
          undo. Oh, the hearts that are broken, the friends estranged, the lives wrecked, by the harsh, hasty words of
          those who might have brought help and healing! ... In his own strength man cannot rule his spirit. But through
          Christ he may gain <nobr>self-control.</nobr></p>
      <p>Uniform ﬁrmness and unimpassioned control are necessary to the discipline of every family. Say what you mean
          calmly, move with consideration, and carry out what you say without deviation.... Never let a frown gather
          upon your brow or</p>
      <p>a harsh word escape your lips. God writes all these words in His book of records. Overwork sometimes causes a
          loss of <nobr>self-control.</nobr> But the Lord never compels hurried, complicated movements. Many gather to
          themselves burdens that the merciful heavenly Father did not place on them. Duties He never designed them to
          perform chase one another wildly. God desires us to realize that we do not glorify His name when we take so
          many burdens that we are overtasked and, becoming heart weary and brain weary, chafe and fret and scold. We
          are to bear only the responsibilities that the Lord gives us, trusting in Him, and thus keeping</p>
      <p>our hearts pure and sweet and sympathetic.</p>
