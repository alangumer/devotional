      <p><strong>Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. Revelation 19:10</p>
      <p>God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world by human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy
          Spirit, qualiﬁed men and enabled them to do this work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to speak
          and what to write. The treasure was entrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, nonetheless, from Heaven. The
          testimony is conveyed through the imperfect expression of human language, yet it is the testimony of God; and
          the obedient, believing child of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace and truth.</p>
      <p>In His Word God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be
          accepted as an authoritative, infallible revelation of His will....</p>
      <p>As presented through different individuals, the truth is brought out in its varied aspects. One writer is more
          strongly impressed with one phase of the subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with his experience or
          with his power of perception and appreciation; another seizes upon a different phase; and each, under the
          guidance of the Holy Spirit, presents what is most forcibly impressed upon his own <nobr>mind–a</nobr>
          different aspect of the truth in each, but a perfect harmony through all. And the truths thus revealed unite
          to form a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men in all the circumstances and experiences of
          life....</p>
      <p>Yet the fact that God has revealed His will to men through His Word has not rendered needless the continued
          presence and guiding of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our Saviour, to open the
          Word to His servants, to illuminate and apply its teachings. And since it was the Spirit of God that inspired
          the Bible, it is impossible that the teaching of the Spirit should ever be contrary to that of the Word.</p>
