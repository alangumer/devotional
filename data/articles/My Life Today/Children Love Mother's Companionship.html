    <h1>Children Love Mother’s Companionship</h1>

      <p><strong>Family Companionship</strong></p>
      <p>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. Proverbs 31:28</p>
      <p>The home should be to the children the most attractive place in the world, and the mother’s presence should be
          its greatest attraction. Children have sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased and easily made
          unhappy....</p>
      <p>Young children love companionship, and can seldom enjoy themselves alone. They yearn for sympathy and
          tenderness. That which they enjoy, they think will please mother also....</p>
      <p>Instead of sending her children from her, that she may not be annoyed by their noise or troubled by their
          little wants, let the mother plan amusement or light work to employ the active hands and minds. By entering
          into their feelings and directing their amusements and employments, the mother will gain the conﬁdence of her
          children.... By patient, watchful love she can turn the minds of the children in the</p>
      <p>right direction, cultivating in them beautiful and attractive traits of character. Mothers should guard against
          training their children to be dependent and</p>
      <p><nobr>self-absorbed.</nobr> Never lead them to think that they are the center, and that everything must revolve
          around them. Some parents give much time and attention to amusing their children, but children should be
          trained to amuse themselves, to exercise their own ingenuity and skill. Thus they will learn to be content
          with very simple pleasures. They should be taught to bear bravely their little disappointments and trials....
          Study to suggest ways by which the children may</p>
      <p>learn to be thoughtful for others.</p>
      <p>In the Word of God we ﬁnd a beautiful description of a happy home and the woman who presides over it: “Her
          children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.”</p>
