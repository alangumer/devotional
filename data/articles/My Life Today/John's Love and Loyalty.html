    <h1>John’s Love and Loyalty</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Examples of Sanctiﬁed Lives</strong></p>
      <p>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth
          in God, and God in him. 1 John 4:16</p>
      <p>The conﬁding love and unselﬁsh devotion manifested in the life and character of John present lessons of untold
          value to the Christian church. Some may present him as possessing this love independent of divine grace; but
          John had, by nature, serious defects of character: he was proud and ambitious and quick to resent slight and
          injury....</p>
      <p>John desired to become like Jesus, and under the transforming inﬂuence of the love of Christ, he became meek
          and lowly of heart. Self was hid in Jesus. He was closely united to the Living Vine, and thus became a
          partaker of the divine nature. Such will ever be the result of communion with Christ. This is true
          sanctiﬁcation.</p>
      <p>There may be marked defects in the character of an individual, yet when he becomes a true disciple of Jesus,
          the power of divine grace makes him a new creature. Christ’s love transforms, sanctiﬁes him. But when persons
          profess to be Christians, and their religion does not make them better men and better women in all the
          relations of <nobr>life–living</nobr> representatives of Christ in disposition and <nobr>character–they</nobr>
          are none of His.</p>
      <p>John enjoyed the blessing of true sanctiﬁcation. But mark, the apostle does not claim to be sinless; he is
          seeking perfection by walking in the light of God’s countenance. He testiﬁes that the man who professes to
          know God, and yet breaks the divine law, gives the lie to his profession.... While we are to love the souls
          for</p>
      <p>whom Christ died, and labor for their salvation, we should not make a compromise with sin. We are not to unite
          with the rebellious, and call this charity. God requires His people in this age of the world to stand, as did
          John in his time, unﬂinchingly for the right, in opposition to <nobr>soul-destroying</nobr> errors.</p>
