      <p>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he
          leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Psalm 23:2, 3</p>
      <p>Let several families living in a city or village unite and leave the occupations which have taxed them
          physically and mentally, and make an excursion into the country to the side of a ﬁne lake or to a nice grove
          where the scenery of nature is beautiful. They should provide themselves with plain, hygienic food, the very
          best fruits and grains, and spread their table under the shade of some tree or under the canopy of heaven. The
          ride, the exercise, and the scenery will quicken the appetite, and they can enjoy a repast which kings might
          envy.</p>
      <p>On such occasions parents and children should feel free from care, labor, and perplexity. Parents should become
          children with their children, making everything as pleasant for them as possible. Let the whole day be given
          to recreation. Exercise in the open air for those whose employment has been withindoors and sedentary will be
          beneﬁcial to health. All who can, should feel it a duty to pursue this course. Nothing will be lost, but much
          gained. They can return to their occupations with new life and new courage to engage in their labor with zeal,
          and they are better prepared to resist disease....</p>
      <p>But few realize the constant, wearing labor of those who are bearing the responsibilities of the work in the
          ofﬁce. They are conﬁned withindoors day after day and week after week, while a constant strain upon the mental
          powers is surely undermining their constitutions and lessening their hold on life....</p>
      <p>They should have a change frequently, should often devote a day wholly to recreation with their families, who
          are almost entirely deprived of their society.</p>
