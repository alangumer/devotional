      <p><strong>The Work of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>When the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Isaiah
          59:19</p>
      <p>Jesus gives the Holy Spirit in large measure for great emergencies, to help our inﬁrmities, to give us strong
          consolation.</p>
      <p>Those who are continually learning in the school of Christ will be able to pursue the even tenor of their way,
          and Satan’s efforts to throw them off their balance will be signally defeated. Temptation is not sin. Jesus
          was holy and pure, yet He was tempted in all points as we are, but with a strength and power that man will
          never be called upon to endure. In His successful resistance He has left us a bright example, that we should
          follow His steps. If we are <nobr>self-conﬁdent</nobr> or <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> we shall be left to fall
          under the power of temptation; but if we look to Jesus and trust in Him we call to our aid a power that has
          conquered the foe on the ﬁeld of battle, and with every temptation He will make a way of escape. When Satan
          comes in like a ﬂood, we must meet his temptations with the sword of the Spirit, and Jesus will be our helper
          and will lift up for us a standard against him.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit was promised to be with those who were wrestling for victory, in demonstration of all
          mightiness, endowing the human agent with supernatural powers and instructing the ignorant in the mysteries of
          the kingdom of God. That the Holy Spirit is to be the grand helper is a wonderful promise.... The</p>
      <p>imparted Holy Spirit enabled His disciples, the apostles, to stand ﬁrmly against every species of idolatry and
          to exalt the Lord and Him alone.</p>
      <p>By His Spirit He is everywhere present. Through the agency of His Spirit and His angels He ministers to the
          children of men.</p>
