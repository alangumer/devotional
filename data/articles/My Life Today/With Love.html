      <p><strong>I Too May Conquer</strong></p>
      <p>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. 1
          Corinthians 13:4</p>
      <p>Those who open their hearts and homes to invite Jesus to abide with them should keep the moral atmosphere
          unclouded by strife, bitterness, wrath, malice, or even an unkind word. Jesus will not abide in a home where
          are contention, envy, and bitterness....</p>
      <p>Paul had a healthful religious experience. The love of Christ was his grand theme and the constraining power
          that governed him.</p>
      <p>When in most discouraging circumstances, which would have had a depressing inﬂuence upon halfway Christians, he
          is ﬁrm of heart, full of courage and hope and cheer, exclaiming, “Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say,
          Rejoice.” The same hope and cheerfulness is seen when he is upon the deck of the ship, the tempest beating
          about him, the ship going to pieces. He gives orders to the commander of the ship and preserves the lives of
          all on board. Although a prisoner, he is really the master of the ship, the freest and happiest man on board.
          When wrecked and driven to a barbarous island, he is the most <nobr>self-possessed,</nobr> the most helpful in
          saving his fellow men from a watery grave. His hands brought the wood to kindle the ﬁre for the beneﬁt of the
          chilled, shipwrecked passengers. When they saw the deadly viper fasten upon his hand, they were ﬁlled with
          terror; but Paul calmly shook it into the ﬁre, knowing it could not harm him; for he implicitly trusted in
          God.</p>
      <p>When before kings and dignitaries of the earth, who held his life in their hands, he quailed not; for he had
          given his life to God.... Grace, like an angel</p>
      <p>of mercy, makes his voice heard sweet and clear, repeating the story of the cross, the matchless love of
          Jesus.</p>
      <p>Love’s agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine.</p>
