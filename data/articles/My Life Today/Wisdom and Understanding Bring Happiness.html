    <h1>Wisdom and Understanding Bring Happiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christians Are Truly Happy</strong></p>
      <p>Happy is the man that ﬁndeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. Proverbs 3:13</p>
      <p>The ceremony of anointing David ... was an intimation to the youth of the high destiny awaiting him....</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the high position which he was to occupy, he quietly continued his employment, content to await
          the development of the Lord’s plans in His own time and way. As humble and modest as before his anointing, the
          shepherd boy returned to the hills, and watched and guarded his ﬂocks as tenderly as ever. But with new
          inspiration he composed his melodies and played upon his harp. Before him spread a landscape of rich and
          varied beauty....</p>
      <p>David, in the beauty and vigor of his young manhood, was preparing to take a high position with the noblest of
          the earth. His talents, as precious gifts from God, were employed to extol the glory of the divine Giver. His
          opportunities of contemplation and meditation served to enrich him with that wisdom and piety that made him
          beloved of God and angels. As he contemplated the perfections of his Creator, clearer conceptions of God
          opened before his soul. Obscure themes were illuminated, difﬁculties were made plain, perplexities were
          harmonized, and each ray of new light called forth fresh bursts of rapture and sweeter anthems of devotion, to
          the glory of God and the Redeemer. The love that moved him, the sorrows that beset him, the triumphs that
          attended him, were all themes for his active thought; and as he beheld the love of God in all the providences
          of his life, his heart throbbed with more fervent adoration and gratitude, his voice rang out in a richer
          melody, his harp was swept with more exultant joy; and the shepherd boy proceeded from strength to strength,
          from knowledge to knowledge; for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him.</p>
