      <p><strong>God in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king. Jeremiah 10:10</p>
      <p>“My presence shall go with thee” (Exodus 33:14), was the promise given during the journey through the
          wilderness. This assurance was accompanied by a marvelous revelation of Jehovah’s character, which enabled
          Moses to proclaim to all Israel the goodness of God and to instruct them fully concerning the attributes of
          their invisible King....</p>
      <p>Till the close of his long life of patient ministry Moses continued his exhortations to Israel to keep their
          eyes ﬁxed on their divine Ruler....</p>
      <p>With what conﬁdence had Moses assured the Israelites of the merciful attributes of Jehovah! Often during the
          wilderness sojourn he had pleaded with God in behalf of erring Israel, and the Lord had spared them....</p>
      <p>The prophet pleaded the marvelous providences and promises of God in behalf of the chosen nation. And then, as
          the strongest of all pleas, he urged the love of God for fallen man.... “Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity
          of this people</p>
      <p>according unto the greatness of Thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”
          ...</p>
      <p>Graciously the Lord responded, “I have pardoned according to thy word.” And then He imparted to Moses, in the
          form of a prophecy, a knowledge of His purpose concerning the ﬁnal triumph of His chosen people. “As truly as
          I live,” He declared, “all the earth shall be ﬁlled with the glory of the Lord.” ... God’s glory, His
          character, His merciful kindness and tender <nobr>love–all</nobr> that Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel
          was to be revealed to all mankind. And this promise of Jehovah was made doubly sure; it was conﬁrmed by an
          oath. As surely as God lives and reigns, His glory shall be declared “among the heathen, His wonders among all
          people.</p>
