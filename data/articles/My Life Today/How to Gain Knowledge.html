    <h1>How to Gain Knowledge</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Growing in Wisdom and Knowledge</strong></p>
      <p>If thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and
          searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and ﬁnd the knowledge
          of God. Proverbs <nobr>2:3-5</nobr></p>
      <p>Let none think that there is no more knowledge for them to gain. The depth of human intellect may be measured;
          the works of human authors may be mastered; but the highest, deepest, broadest ﬂight of the imagination cannot
          ﬁnd out God. There is inﬁnity beyond all that we can comprehend. We have seen only the glimmering of divine
          glory and of the inﬁnitude of knowledge and wisdom; we have, as it were, been working on the surface of the
          mine, when rich, golden ore is beneath the surface, to reward the one who will dig for it. The shaft must be
          sunk deeper and yet deeper in the mine, and the result will be glorious treasure. Through a correct faith
          divine knowledge will become human knowledge.</p>
      <p>No one can search the Scriptures in the Spirit of Christ without being rewarded. When a man is willing to be
          instructed as a little child, when he submits wholly to Christ, he will ﬁnd the truth in His Word. If men
          would be obedient, they would understand the plan of God’s government. The heavenly world would open its
          treasures of grace and glory for exploration. Human beings would be altogether different from what they are
          now; for by exploring the mines of truth, men would be ennobled. The mystery of redemption, the incarnation of
          Christ, His atoning sacriﬁce, would not be, as they are now, vague in our minds. They would be, not only
          better understood, but altogether more highly appreciated....</p>
      <p>The experimental knowledge of God and of Christ transforms man into the image of God. It gives man the mastery
          of himself, bringing every impulse and passion ... under the control of the higher powers of the mind. It
          makes its possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings him into communion with the mind of the
          Inﬁnite and opens to him the rich treasures of the universe.</p>
