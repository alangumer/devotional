      <p><strong>Guarding the Avenues to the Soul</strong></p>
      <p>Be ﬁlled with the Spirit; speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making
          melody in your heart to the Lord. Ephesians 5:18, 19</p>
      <p>God is gloriﬁed by songs of praise from a pure heart ﬁlled with love and devotion to Him.... The gratitude
          which they [Christians] feel and the peace of</p>
      <p>God ruling within cause them to make melody in their hearts unto the Lord and by words to make mention of the
          debt of love and thankfulness due the dear Saviour, who so loved them as to die that they might have
          life.</p>
      <p>The history of the songs of the Bible is full of suggestion as to the uses and beneﬁts of music and song. Music
          is often perverted to serve purposes of evil, and thus becomes one of the most alluring agencies of
          temptation. But, rightly employed, it is a precious gift of God, designed to uplift the thoughts to high and
          noble themes, to inspire and elevate the soul.</p>
      <p>As the children of Israel, journeying through the wilderness, cheered their way by the music of sacred song, so
          God bids His children today gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means more effective for ﬁxing His words
          in the memory than repeating them in song. And such song has wonderful power. It has power to subdue rude and
          uncultivated natures; power to quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to promote harmony of action, and to
          banish the gloom and foreboding that destroy courage and weaken effort.</p>
      <p>It is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth. How often to the soul hard
          pressed and ready to despair, memory recalls some word of <nobr>God’s–the</nobr><nobr>long-forgotten</nobr>
          burden of a childhood <nobr>song–and</nobr> temptations lose their power, life takes on new meaning and new
          purpose, and courage and gladness are imparted to other souls!</p>
