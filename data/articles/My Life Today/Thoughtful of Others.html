      <p>Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous. 1
          Peter 3:8</p>
      <p>The great apostle Paul was ﬁrm where duty and principle were at stake; he preached Christ with great boldness;
          but he was never harsh and impolite. He had a tender heart, and was ever kind and thoughtful of others.
          Courtesy was a marked trait of his character, and this gave him access to the better class of society....</p>
      <p>He was zealous for the truth, bold in advocating Christ; but propriety of deportment, the grace of true
          politeness, marked all his conduct....</p>
      <p>Paul attracted warm hearts wherever he went; his soul was linked to the soul of his brethren. When he parted
          with them, knowing and assuring them that they would never see his face again, they were ﬁlled with sorrow,
          and so earnestly besought him to still remain with them that he exclaimed, “What mean ye to weep and to break
          mine heart?” His sympathetic heart was breaking as he witnessed and felt their grief at this ﬁnal separation.
          They loved him, and felt that they could not give him up. What Christian does not admire the character of
          Paul? Firm as a rock when standing in defense of the truth, he was affectionate and gentle as a child when
          surrounded by his friends....</p>
      <p>The most Christlike professors are those who are the most kind, pitiful, and courteous; their convictions are
          ﬁrm and their characters strong; nothing can swerve them from their faith or allure them from their duty.</p>
      <p>A Christian will cultivate a meek and quiet spirit; he will be calm, considerate of others, and will have a
          happy temper that sickness will not make irritable or the weather or circumstances disturb.... The children of
          God never forget to do</p>
      <p>good.... Good works are spontaneous with them, for God has transformed their</p>
      <p>natures by His grace.</p>
