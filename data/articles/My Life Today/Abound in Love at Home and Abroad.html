      <p><strong>Saved to Serve</strong></p>
      <p>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. And the Lord make you to
          increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you. 1 Thessalonians
          3:11, 12</p>
      <p>Missionary work is to be done in the home. Here those who have received Christ are to show what grace has done
          for them. A divine inﬂuence controls the true believer in Christ, and this inﬂuence makes itself felt
          throughout the home and is favorable for the perfection of the characters of all in the home.</p>
      <p>The faithful performance of home duties has an inﬂuence upon those not in the home. Our spiritual progress in
          the home is carried into our missionary work abroad. In the father’s house is to be given the evidence of a
          ﬁtness to work for the church. With earnest, humble hearts the members of the family are to seek to know that
          Christ is abiding in the heart. Then they can go forth fully armed and equipped for service....</p>
      <p>The effort to make the home what it should <nobr>be–a</nobr> symbol of the home in <nobr>heaven–prepares</nobr>
          us for work in a larger sphere. The education received by showing a tender regard for each other enables us to
          know how to reach hearts that need to be taught the principles of true religion. The church needs all the
          cultivated spiritual force which can be obtained, that all, and especially the younger members of the Lord’s
          family, may be carefully guarded. The truth lived at home makes itself felt in disinterested labor abroad. He
          who lives Christianity in the home will be a bright and shining light everywhere.</p>
      <p>The more closely the members of the family are united in their work in the home, the more uplifting and helpful
          will be the inﬂuence that father and mother and sons and daughters will exert outside the home.</p>
