    <h1>The Helmet of Salvation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Equipped for Victory</strong></p>
      <p>For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the
          garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. Isaiah 59:17</p>
      <p>Many have confused ideas in regard to conversion. They have often heard the words repeated from the pulpit, “Ye
          must be born again.” “You must have a new heart.” These expressions have perplexed them. They could not
          comprehend the plan of salvation.</p>
      <p>Many have stumbled to ruin because of the erroneous doctrines taught by some ministers concerning the change
          that takes place at conversion. Some have lived in sadness for years, waiting for some marked evidence that
          they were accepted by God. They have separated themselves in a large measure from the world, and ﬁnd pleasure
          in associating with the people of God; yet they dare not profess Christ, because they fear it would be
          presumption to say that they are children of God. They are waiting for that peculiar change that they have
          been led to believe is connected with conversion.</p>
      <p>After a time some of these do receive evidence of their acceptance with God, and are then led to identify
          themselves with His people. And they date their conversion from this time. But ... they were adopted into the
          family of God before that time. God accepted them when they became weary of sin, and having lost their desire
          for worldly pleasures, resolved to seek God earnestly. But, failing to understand the simplicity of the plan
          of salvation, they lost many privileges and blessings which they might have claimed had they only believed,
          when they ﬁrst turned to God, that He had accepted them.</p>
      <p>Others fall into a more dangerous error. They are governed by impulse. Their sympathies are stirred, and they
          regard this ﬂight of feeling as an evidence that they are accepted by God and are converted. But the
          principles of their life are not changed. The evidences of a genuine work of grace on the heart are to be
          found not in feeling, but in the life.</p>
