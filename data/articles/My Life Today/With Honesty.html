    <h1>With Honesty</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I Too May Conquer</strong></p>
      <p>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. Romans 12:17</p>
      <p>In every business transaction a Christian will be just what he wants his brethren to think he is. His course of
          action is guided by underlying principles. He does not scheme; therefore he has nothing to conceal, nothing to
          gloss over. He may be criticized, he may be tested, but his unbending integrity will shine forth like pure
          gold. He is a blessing to all connected with him, for his word is trustworthy. He is a man who will not take
          an advantage of his neighbor. He is a friend and benefactor to all, and his fellow men put conﬁdence in his
          counsel....</p>
      <p>A truly honest man will never take advantage of weakness or incompetency in order to ﬁll his own purse. He
          accepts a fair equivalent for that which he sells. If there are defects in the articles sold, he frankly tells
          his brother or his neighbor, although by so doing he may work against his own pecuniary interests.</p>
      <p>In all the details of life the strictest principles of honesty are to be maintained. These are not the
          principles which govern our world, for Satan, deceiver, liar, and oppressor is the master, and his subjects
          follow him and carry out his purposes. But Christians serve under a different Master, and their actions must
          be wrought in God, irrespective of all selﬁsh gain. Deviation from perfect fairness in business deal may
          appear as a small thing in the estimation of some, but our Saviour did not thus regard it....</p>
      <p>A man may not have a pleasant exterior, he may be deﬁcient in many respects, but if he has a reputation for
          straightforward honesty, he will be respected.... A</p>
      <p>man who steadfastly adheres to truth will win the conﬁdence of all. Not only will his brethren in the faith
          trust him, but unbelievers will be constrained to acknowledge him as a man of honor.</p>
