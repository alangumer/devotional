      <p>Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. 2
          Chronicles 20:20</p>
      <p>The light of prophecy still burns for the guidance of souls, saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it.” It
          shines on the pathway of the just to commend, and on the way of the unjust to lead to repentance and
          conversion. Through its agency sin will be rebuked and iniquity unmasked. It is progressive in the performance
          of its duty to reﬂect light on the past, the present, and the future.</p>
      <p>If those who have received the light will appreciate and respect the testimonies of the Lord, they will see the
          religious life in a new light. They will be convicted. They will see the key that unlocks the mysteries that
          they have never understood. They will lay hold of the precious things that God has given them to proﬁt withal
          and will be translated from the kingdom of darkness into God’s marvelous light.</p>
      <p>Those who despise the warning will be left in blindness to become <nobr>self-deceived.</nobr> But those who
          heed it, and zealously go about the work of separating their sins from them in order to have the needed
          graces, will be opening the door of their hearts that the dear Saviour may come in and dwell with them.</p>
      <p>He [God] has made provision that all may be holy and happy if they choose. Sufﬁcient light has been given to
          this generation, that we may learn what our duties and privileges are and enjoy the precious and solemn truths
          in their simplicity and power.</p>
      <p>We are accountable only for the light that shines upon us. The commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus
          are testing us. If we are faithful and obedient, God will delight in us, and bless us as His own chosen,
          peculiar people. When perfect faith and perfect love and obedience abound, working in the hearts of those who
          are Christ’s followers, they will have a powerful inﬂuence.</p>
