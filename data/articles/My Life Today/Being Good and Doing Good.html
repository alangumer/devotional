      <p><strong>Highways to Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shall thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Psalm 37:3</p>
      <p>Real happiness is found only in being good and doing good. The purest, highest enjoyment comes to those who
          faithfully fulﬁll their appointed duties....</p>
      <p>To all Christ has given the work of ministry. He is the King of glory, yet He declared, “The Son of man came
          not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” He is the Majesty of heaven, yet He willingly consented to come
          to this earth to do the work laid upon Him by His Father. He has ennobled labor. That He might set us an
          example of industry, He worked with His hands at the carpenter’s trade. From a very early age He acted His
          part in sustaining the family. He realized that He was a part of the family ﬁrm, and willingly bore His share
          of the burdens.</p>
      <p>Children and youth should take pleasure in making lighter the cares of father and mother, showing an unselﬁsh
          interest in the home. As they cheerfully lift the burdens that fall to their share, they are receiving a
          training which will ﬁt them for positions of trust and usefulness. Each year they are to make steady
          advancement, gradually but surely laying aside the inexperience of boyhood and girlhood for the experience of
          manhood and womanhood. In the faithful performance of the simple duties of the home, boys and girls lay the
          foundation for mental, moral, and spiritual excellence.</p>
      <p>Riches and idleness are thought by some to be blessings indeed; but those who are always busy, and who
          cheerfully go about their daily tasks, are the most happy and enjoy the best health. The healthful weariness
          which results from <nobr>well-regulated</nobr> labor secures to them the beneﬁts of refreshing sleep. The
          sentence that man must toil for his daily bread, and the promise of future happiness and glory, both came from
          the same throne, and both are blessings.</p>
