    <h1>Have an Understanding Heart</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart. 1 Kings 3:12 Solomon in his youth made David’s choice his
          own. Above every earthly</p>
      <p>good he asked of God a wise and understanding heart.... The power of his</p>
      <p>understanding, the extent of his knowledge, the glory of his reign, became the wonder of the world.</p>
      <p>The name of Jehovah was greatly honored during the ﬁrst part of Solomon’s reign. The wisdom and righteousness
          revealed by the king bore witness to all nations of the excellency of the attributes of the God whom he
          served. For a time Israel was as the light of the world, showing forth the greatness of Jehovah. Not in the
          surpassing wisdom, the fabulous riches, the <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> power and fame that were his, lay the
          real glory of Solomon’s early reign; but in the honor that he brought to the name of the God of Israel through
          a wise use of the gifts of Heaven.</p>
      <p>As the years went by and Solomon’s fame increased, he sought to honor God by adding to his mental and spiritual
          strength and by continuing to impart to others the blessings he received. None understood better than he that
          it was through the favor of Jehovah that he had come into possession of power and wisdom and understanding,
          and that these gifts were bestowed that he might give to the world a knowledge of the King of kings.</p>
      <p>As the man is converted by the truth, the work of transformation of character goes on. He has an increased
          measure of understanding, in becoming a man of obedience to God. The mind and will of God become His will, and
          by constantly looking to God for counsel, he becomes a man of increased understanding. There is a general
          development of the mind that is unreservedly placed under the guidance of the Spirit of God.</p>
