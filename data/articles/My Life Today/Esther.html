      <p><strong>Esther</strong></p>
      <p>Heroes for God</p>
      <p>And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? Esther 4:14</p>
      <p>A certain day was appointed on which the Jews were to be destroyed and their property conﬁscated. Little did
          the king realize the <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> results that would have accompanied the complete carrying out
          of this decree. Satan himself, the hidden instigator of the scheme, was trying to rid the earth of those who
          preserved the knowledge of the true God....</p>
      <p>But the plots of the enemy were defeated by a Power that reigns among the children of men. In the providence of
          God, Esther, a Jewess who feared the Most High, had been made queen of the <nobr>Medo-Persian</nobr> kingdom.
          Mordecai was a near relative of hers. In their extremity they decided to appeal to Xerxes in behalf of their
          people. Esther was to venture into his presence as an intercessor. “Who knoweth,” said Mordecai, “whether thou
          art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”</p>
      <p>The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick, earnest action; but both she and Mordecai realized that unless God
          should work mightily in their behalf, their own efforts would be unavailing. So Esther took time for communion
          with God, the source of her strength. “Go,” she directed Mordecai, “gather together all the Jews that are
          present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my
          maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I
          perish, I perish.”</p>
      <p>To every household and every school, to every parent, teacher, and child upon whom has shone the light of the
          gospel, comes at this crisis the question put to Esther the queen at that momentous crisis in Israel’s
          history, “Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”</p>
