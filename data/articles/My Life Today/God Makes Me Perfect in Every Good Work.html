      <p><strong>God Makes Me Perfect in Every Good Work</strong></p>
      <p>God Works Throught Me</p>
      <p>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep,
          through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in
          you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Hebrews
          13:20, 21</p>
      <p>The religion of Jesus Christ means something more than talk. The righteousness of Christ consists in right
          actions and good works from pure, unselﬁsh motives....Christ came to do His Father’s will. Are we following in
          His</p>
      <p>steps? All who have named the name of Christ should be constantly seeking for a more intimate acquaintance with
          Him, that they may walk even as He walked, and do the works of Christ....</p>
      <p>It is the work we do, or do not do, that tells with tremendous power upon our lives and destinies. God requires
          us to improve every opportunity for usefulness that is offered us. Neglect in doing this is perilous to our
          spiritual growth. We have a great work to do.</p>
      <p>The duties that the Lord places in our way we are to perform, not as a cold, dreary exercise, but as a service
          of love. Bring into your work your highest powers and sympathies, and you will ﬁnd that Christ is in it. His
          presence will make the work light, and your heart will be ﬁlled with joy. You will work in harmony with God,
          and in loyalty and love and ﬁdelity. We are to be sincere, earnest Christians, doing faithfully the work
          placed in our hands.</p>
      <p>Every one who kindles his taper from the divine altar holds his lamp ﬁrmly. He does not use common ﬁre upon his
          censer, but the holy ﬁre, kept burning by the power of God day and night. Those who walk in the footsteps of
          Jesus, who will surrender their lives to His guidance and to His service, have the golden oil in their vessels
          with their lamps. They will never be placed in a position for which God has not made provision. The lamp of
          life is always trimmed by the very hand that lit it.</p>
