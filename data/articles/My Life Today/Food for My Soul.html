    <h1>Food for My Soul</h1>

      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.
          Jeremiah 15:16</p>
      <p>It is impossible for any human mind to exhaust one truth or promise of the Bible. One catches the glory from
          one point of view, another from another point; yet we can discern only gleamings. The full radiance is beyond
          our vision. As we contemplate the great things of God’s Word, we look into a fountain that broadens and
          deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth and depth pass our knowledge. As we gaze, the vision widens; stretched
          out before us, we behold a boundless, shoreless sea. Such study has vivifying power. The mind and heart
          acquire new strength, new life.</p>
      <p>This experience is the highest evidence of the divine authorship of the Bible. We receive God’s Word as food
          for the soul through the same evidence by which we receive bread as food for the body. Bread supplies the need
          of our nature; we know by experience that it produces blood, bone, and brain. Apply the same test to the
          Bible; when its principles have actually become the elements of character, what has been the result? what
          changes have been made in the <nobr>life?–“Old</nobr> things are passed away; behold, all things are become
          new.” In its power men and women have broken the chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selﬁshness. The
          profane have become reverent, the drunken sober, the proﬂigate pure. Souls that have borne the likeness of
          Satan have been transformed into the image of God. The change is itself the miracle of miracles. A change
          wrought by the Word, it is one of the deepest mysteries of the Word. We cannot understand it; we can only
          believe, that, as declared by the Scriptures, it is “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” A knowledge of this
          mystery furnishes a key to every other. It opens to the soul the treasures of the universe, the possibilities
          of inﬁnite development.</p>
