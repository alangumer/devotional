    <h1>Sing and Pray With My Neighbors</h1>

      <p><strong>Being a God Neighbor</strong></p>
      <p>They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. 2 Chronicles 29:30</p>
      <p>The presentation of the truth in love and sympathy, from house to house, is in harmony with the instruction
          that Christ gave to His disciples when He sent them out on their ﬁrst missionary tour. By songs of praise to
          God, by humble, heartfelt prayers, by a simple presentation of Bible truth in the family circle, many will be
          reached. The divine [Worker] will be present to send conviction to hearts. “I am with you alway” is His
          promise. With the assurance of the abiding presence of such a Helper, we may labor with hope and faith and
          courage.</p>
      <p>Those who have the gift of song are needed. Song is one of the most effective means of impressing spiritual
          truth upon the heart. Often by the words of sacred songs the springs of penitence and faith have been
          unsealed.... Church members,</p>
      <p>young and old, should be educated to go forth to proclaim this last message to the world. If they go in
          humility, angels of God will go with them, teaching them how to lift up the voice in prayer, how to raise the
          voice in song, and how to proclaim the gospel message for this time.</p>
      <p>Learn to sing the simplest of songs. These will help you in <nobr>house-to-house</nobr> labor, and hearts will
          be touched by the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit. Christ was often heard singing hymns of praise.... There was
          joy in His heart. We learn from</p>
      <p>the Word that there is joy among the angels of heaven over one repentant sinner and that the Lord rejoices over
          His church with singing.</p>
      <p>As, like the disciples, you go from place to place telling the story of the Saviour’s love, you will make
          friends and will see the fruit of your labor.</p>
