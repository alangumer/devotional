    <h1>Families Will Be Reunited</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Heavens Is a Real and Wonderful Place</strong></p>
      <p>Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and
          they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy
          children shall come again to their own border. Jeremiah 31:16, 17</p>
      <p>Christ is coming with clouds and with great glory.... He will come to raise</p>
      <p>the dead, and to change the living saints from glory to glory.... There will be a</p>
      <p><nobr>re-linking</nobr> of the family chain.</p>
      <p>Oh, wonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with eager anticipation....</p>
      <p>The living righteous are changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” At the voice of God they were
          gloriﬁed; now they are made immortal, and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air.
          Angels “gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” Little children
          are borne by holy angels to their mothers’ arms. Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to
          part, and with songs of gladness ascend together to the city of God.</p>
      <p>With joy unutterable parents see the crown, the robe, the harp, given to their children. The days of hope and
          fear are ended.... Their children have been</p>
      <p>redeemed.</p>
      <p>There we shall see on every hand the beautiful trees of Paradise, in the midst of them the tree of life. There
          we shall behold with undimmed vision the beauties of Eden restored. There we shall cast at the feet of our
          Redeemer the crowns that He has placed on our heads, and touching our golden harps, we shall offer praise and
          thanksgiving to Him that sitteth on the throne.... May you all be among those</p>
      <p>who shall enter through the gates of pearl into the city of our God. May you, as unbroken families, dwell
          forever in that haven of rest. To this end may God help you now to strive for the crown of life.</p>
