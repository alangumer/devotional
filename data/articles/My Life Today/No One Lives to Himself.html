      <p><strong>Recreation and Amusements</strong></p>
      <p>For none of us liveth to himself. Romans 14:7</p>
      <p>The young generally conduct themselves as though the precious hours of probation, while mercy lingers, were one
          grand holiday, and they were placed in this world merely for their own amusement, to be gratiﬁed with a
          continual round of excitement. Satan has been making special efforts to lead them to ﬁnd happiness in worldly
          amusements and to justify themselves by endeavoring to show that these amusements are harmless, innocent, and
          even important to health.</p>
      <p>The desire for excitement and pleasing entertainment is a temptation and a snare to God’s people, and
          especially to the young. Satan is constantly preparing inducements to attract minds from the solemn work of
          preparation for scenes just in the future. Through the agency of worldlings he keeps up a continual excitement
          to induce the unwary to join in worldly pleasures. There are shows, lectures, and an endless variety of
          entertainments that are calculated to lead to a love of the world; and through this union with the world faith
          is weakened.</p>
      <p>Worldly pleasures are infatuating; and for their momentary enjoyment many sacriﬁce the friendship of Heaven,
          with the peace, love, and joy that it affords.</p>
      <p>Christians have many sources of happiness at their command, and they may tell with unerring accuracy what
          pleasures are lawful and right. They may enjoy such recreations as will not dissipate the mind or debase the
          soul, such as will not disappoint, and leave a sad <nobr>after-inﬂuence</nobr> to destroy
          <nobr>self-respect</nobr> or bar the way to usefulness. If they can take Jesus with them, and maintain a
          prayerful spirit, they are perfectly safe.</p>
      <p>In view of their high calling the youth among us should ... ponder well the paths of their feet, remembering
          that where they lead the way others will follow.</p>
