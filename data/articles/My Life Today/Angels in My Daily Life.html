      <p><strong>Angel Guidance in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. Psalm 34:7</p>
      <p>Today ... heavenly messengers are passing through the length and breadth of the land, seeking to comfort the
          sorrowing, to protect the impenitent, to win the hearts of men to Christ. We cannot see them personally;
          nevertheless they are with us, guiding, directing, protecting....</p>
      <p>These angels of light create a heavenly atmosphere about the soul, lifting us toward the unseen and the
          eternal. We cannot behold their forms with our natural sight; only by spiritual vision can we discern heavenly
          things. The spiritual ear alone can hear the harmony of heavenly voices....</p>
      <p>Again and again have angels talked with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places of
          security. Again and again have the encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits of the faithful,
          and carrying their minds above the things of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white robes, the
          crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers will receive when they surround the great white
          throne.</p>
      <p>It is the work of the angels to come close to the tried, the suffering, the tempted. They labor untiringly in
          behalf of those for whom Christ died.</p>
      <p>Angels are ever present where they are most needed. They are with those who have the hardest battles to ﬁght,
          with those who must battle against inclination and hereditary tendencies, whose home surroundings are the most
          discouraging.</p>
      <p>Heavenly beings are appointed to do their work of <nobr>ministry–to</nobr> guide, guard, and control those who
          shall be heirs of salvation.... Faithful sentinels are on guard</p>
      <p>to direct souls in right paths.</p>
