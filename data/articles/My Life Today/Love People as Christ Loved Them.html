      <p><strong>Social to Save</strong></p>
      <p>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. John 15:12</p>
      <p>Christ carried out in His life His own divine teachings. His zeal never led Him to become passionate. He
          manifested consistency without obstinacy, benevolence without weakness, tenderness and sympathy without
          sentimentalism. He was highly social, yet He possessed a reserved dignity that did not encourage undue
          familiarity. His temperance never led to bigotry or austerity. He was not conformed to this world, yet He was
          not indifferent to the wants of the least among men. He was awake to the needs of all.</p>
      <p>From earliest years to manhood Christ lived a life that was a perfect pattern of humility and industry and
          obedience. He was always thoughtful and considerate of others, always <nobr>self-denying.</nobr> He came
          bearing the signature of heaven, not to be ministered unto, but to minister....</p>
      <p>The unselﬁsh life of Christ is an example to all. His character is a pattern of the characters we may form if
          we follow on in His footsteps.</p>
      <p>Tact and good judgment increase the usefulness of the laborer a hundredfold. If he will speak the right words
          at the right time and show the right spirit, this will exert a melting power on the heart of the one he is
          trying to help.</p>
      <p>Those who differ with us in faith and doctrine should be treated kindly. They are the property of Christ, and
          we must meet them in the great day of ﬁnal account. We shall have to face one another in the judgment, and
          behold the record of our thoughts, words, and deeds, not as we have viewed them, but as they were in truth.
          God has enjoined upon us the duty of loving one another as Christ has loved us.</p>
