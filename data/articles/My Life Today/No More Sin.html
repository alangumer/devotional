    <h1>No More Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Christ Redeems Me Unto Eternal Life</strong></p>
      <p>And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall
          serve him: and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. Revelation 22:3, 4</p>
      <p>Every trace of the curse is swept away.... One reminder alone remains: our</p>
      <p>Redeemer will ever bear the marks of His cruciﬁxion. Upon His wounded head, upon His side, His hands and feet,
          are the only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. Says the prophet, beholding Christ in His glory,
          “He had bright beams [margin] coming out of His side: and there was the hiding of His power.” That pierced
          side whence ﬂowed the crimson stream that reconciled man to <nobr>God–there</nobr> is the Saviour’s glory,
          there “the hiding of His power.” “Mighty to save,” through the sacriﬁce of redemption, He was therefore strong
          to execute justice upon them that despised God’s mercy. And the tokens of His humiliation are His highest
          honor; through the eternal ages the wounds of Calvary will show forth His praise and declare His
          power....</p>
      <p>The time has come to which holy men have looked with longing since the ﬂaming sword barred the ﬁrst pair from
          <nobr>Eden–the</nobr> time for “the redemption of the purchased possession.” The earth originally given to man
          as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought
          back by the great plan of redemption. All that was lost by sin has been restored.... God’s original purpose in
          the creation of the earth is fulﬁlled as it</p>
      <p>is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. “The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein
          forever.”</p>
      <p>Then we shall enjoy with Him all the glories of the world to come throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity....
          There is nothing in the kingdom of God to disturb</p>
      <p>or annoy. This is the life that is promised to the <nobr>overcomer–a</nobr> life of happiness and peace, a life
          of love and beauty.... There is no sin, no distracting care, nothing to</p>
      <p>mar the peace of the inhabitant.</p>
