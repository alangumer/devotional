      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Psalm 73:24</p>
      <p>The Christian evidence that we need, is found not in the experience of men, but in our Bibles. The Word of God
          is the man of our counsel; for it brings us down from age to age, bearing its testimony to the
          unchangeableness of the truth. Not one of the ancient defenses of the word of God, appropriate for special
          times, has become worn out. No part of the Bible has died from old age. All the past history of the people of
          God is to be studied by us today, that we may beneﬁt by the experiences recorded.</p>
      <p>Men break their word, and prove themselves untrustworthy, but God changes not. His word will abide the same
          forever.</p>
      <p>Give the Word its honored position as a guide in the home. Let it be regarded as the Counsellor in every
          difﬁculty, the standard of every practice.... There can</p>
      <p>never be true prosperity to any soul in the family circle unless the truth of God, the wisdom of righteousness,
          presides.</p>
      <p>We all need a guide through the many straight places of life, as much as the sailor needs a pilot over the
          sandy bar or up the rocky river....</p>
      <p>The sailor who has in his possession chart and compass, and yet neglects to use them, is responsible for
          placing the lives of those on board his vessel in peril. The vessel may be lost by his neglect. We have a
          Guidebook, the Word of God, and we are inexcusable if we miss the way to heaven, for plain directions have
          been given us.</p>
      <p>The Bible presents a perfect standard of character; it is an infallible guide under all circumstances, even to
          the end of the journey of life.</p>
