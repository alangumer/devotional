      <p><strong>Growing in Grace</strong></p>
      <p>Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
          overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong
          tower from the enemy. Psalm <nobr>61:1-3</nobr></p>
      <p>Have you ever watched a hawk in pursuit of a timid dove? Instinct has taught the dove that in order for the
          hawk to seize his prey, he must gain a loftier ﬂight than his victim. So she rises higher and still higher
          into the blue dome of heaven, ever pursued by the hawk, which is seeking to obtain the advantage. But in vain.
          The dove is safe as long as she allows nothing to stop her in her ﬂight, or draw her earthward; but let her
          once falter, and take a lower ﬂight, and her watchful enemy will swoop down upon his victim. Again and again
          have we watched this scene with almost breathless interest, all our sympathies with the little dove. How sad
          we should have felt to see it fall a victim to the cruel hawk!</p>
      <p>We have before us a <nobr>warfare–a</nobr> lifelong conﬂict with Satan and his seductive temptations. The enemy
          will use every argument, every deception, to entangle the soul; and in order to win the crown of life, we must
          put forth earnest, persevering effort. We must not lay off the armor or leave the battleﬁeld until we have
          gained the victory, and can triumph in our Redeemer.</p>
      <p>As long as we continue to keep our eyes ﬁxed upon the Author and Finisher of our faith we shall be safe. But
          our affections must be placed upon things above, not on things on the earth. By faith we must rise higher and
          still higher in the attainments of the graces of Christ. By daily contemplating His matchless charms, we must
          grow more and more into His glorious image. While we thus live in communion with Heaven, Satan will lay his
          nets for us in vain.</p>
