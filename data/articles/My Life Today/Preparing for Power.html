      <p><strong>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall
          come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19</p>
      <p>Instead of being worked by the Holy Spirit, many, even among those engaged in the solemn work of God, are
          barring the way against its holy, <nobr>life-giving</nobr> inﬂuences. They freely criticize and judge their
          brethren, and yet they do not realize the necessity of earnestly looking into the divine mirror to see what
          spirit they themselves are manifesting. Their defects of character they regard as virtues, and cling to
          them....</p>
      <p>Let there be a work of reformation and repentance. Let all seek for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. As with
          the disciples after the ascension of Christ, it may require several days of earnestly seeking God and putting
          away of sin.</p>
      <p>When God’s people are worked by the Holy Spirit, they will manifest a zeal that is according to knowledge....
          They will reﬂect the light that God has been</p>
      <p>giving for years. The spirit of criticism will be put away. Filled with the spirit of humility, they will be of
          one mind, united with one another and with Christ.</p>
      <p>When a man is ﬁlled with the Spirit, the more severely he is tested and tried, the more clearly he proves that
          he is a representative of Christ. The peace that dwells in the soul is seen on the countenance. The words and
          actions express the love of the Saviour. There is no striving for the highest place. Self is renounced. The
          name of Jesus is written on all that is said and done.</p>
      <p>When the truth in its simplicity is lived in every place, then God will work through His angels as He worked on
          the day of Pentecost, and hearts will be changed so decidedly that there will be a manifestation of the
          inﬂuence of genuine truth, as is represented in the descent of the Holy Spirit.</p>
