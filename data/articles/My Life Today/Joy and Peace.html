    <h1>Joy and Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>Now the God of hope ﬁll you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power
          of the Holy Ghost. Romans 15:13</p>
      <p>The Lord has determined that every soul who obeys His word shall have His joy, His peace, His continual keeping
          power. Such men and women are brought near Him always, not only when they kneel before Him in prayer, but when
          they take up the duties of life. He has prepared for them an abiding place with Himself, where the life is
          puriﬁed from all grossness, all unloveliness. By this unbroken communion with Him, they are made colaborers
          with Him in their lifework.</p>
      <p>Words cannot describe the peace and joy possessed by him who takes God at His word. Trials do not disturb him,
          slights do not vex him. Self is cruciﬁed. Day by day his duties may become more taxing, his temptations
          stronger, his trials more severe; but he does not falter; for he receives strength equal to his need.</p>
      <p>Those who are learning at the feet of Jesus will surely exemplify by their deportment and conversation the
          character of Christ.... Their experience is marked</p>
      <p>less with bustle and excitement than with a subdued and reverent joy. Their love for Christ is a quiet,
          peaceful, yet <nobr>all-controlling</nobr> power. The light and love of an indwelling Saviour are revealed in
          every word and every act.</p>
      <p>There have been times when the blessing of God has been bestowed in answer to prayer, so that when others have
          come into the room, no sooner did they step over the threshold than they exclaimed, “The Lord is here!” Not a
          word had been uttered, but the blessed inﬂuence of God’s holy presence was sensibly felt. The joy that comes
          from Jesus Christ was there; and in this sense the Lord had been in the room just as verily as He walked
          through the streets of Jerusalem, or appeared to the disciples when they were in the upper chamber, and said,
          “Peace be unto you.”</p>
