    <h1>Feet Shod with Gospel of Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Equipped for Victory</strong></p>
      <p>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Ephesians 6:15</p>
      <p>The Lord is soon coming. Talk it, pray it, believe it. Make it a part of the life. You will have to meet a
          doubting, objecting spirit, but this will give way before ﬁrm, consistent trust in God. When perplexities or
          hindrances present themselves, lift the soul to God in songs of thanksgiving. Gird on the Christian armor, and
          be sure that your feet are “shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.”</p>
      <p>We are living in the midst of an “epidemic of crime,” at which thoughtful, <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> men
          everywhere stand aghast. The corruption that prevails, it is beyond the power of the human pen to describe.
          Every day brings fresh revelations of political strife, bribery, and fraud. Every day brings its
          <nobr>heart-sickening</nobr> record of violence and lawlessness, of indifference to human suffering, of
          brutal, ﬁendish destruction of human life. Every day testiﬁes to the increase of insanity, murder, and
          suicide. Who can doubt that satanic agencies are at work among men with increasing activity to distract and
          corrupt the mind and deﬁle and destroy the body? ...</p>
      <p>Everywhere there are hearts crying out for something which they have not. They long for a power that will give
          them mastery over sin, a power that will deliver them from the bondage of evil, a power that will give health
          and life and peace. Many who once knew the power of God’s Word have dwelt where there is no recognition of
          God, and they long for the divine presence.</p>
      <p>The world needs today what it needed nineteen hundred years <nobr>ago–a</nobr> revelation of Christ.</p>
      <p>For earth’s sin and misery the gospel is the only antidote.</p>
