    <h1>We Shall Recognize Each Other</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Heavens Is a Real and Wonderful Place</strong></p>
      <p>Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known. 1 Corinthians 13:12</p>
      <p>In the mansions above we shall meet to part no more. We shall know each other in our heavenly home.</p>
      <p>The redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What
          blessed converse they have with these souls! “I was a sinner,” it will be said, “without God and without hope
          in the world, and you came to me and drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope.... Others will
          say, “I was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your</p>
      <p>friends and comfortable home and came to teach me how to ﬁnd Jesus and believe in Him as the only true God. I
          demolished my idols and worshiped God, and now I see Him face to face. I am saved, eternally saved, ever to
          behold Him whom I love....”</p>
      <p>Others will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry and clothed the naked. “When despair bound my
          soul in unbelief, the Lord sent you to me,” they say, “to speak words of hope and comfort. You brought me food
          for my physical necessities, and you opened to me the Word of God, awakening me to my spiritual needs. You
          treated me as a brother. You sympathized with me in my sorrows, and restored my bruised and wounded soul, so
          that I could grasp the hand of Christ that was reached out to save me. In my ignorance you taught me patiently
          that I had a Father in heaven who cared for me. You read to me the precious promises of God’s Word. You
          inspired in me the faith that He would save me. My heart was softened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated the
          sacriﬁce which Christ had made for me.... I am here, saved, eternally saved, ever to live in His presence
          and</p>
      <p>to praise Him who gave His life for me.”</p>
      <p>What rejoicing there will be as these redeemed ones meet and greet those who have had a burden in their behalf!
          And those who have lived, not to please themselves, but to be a blessing to the unfortunate who have so few
          <nobr>blessings–how</nobr> their hearts will thrill with satisfaction!</p>
