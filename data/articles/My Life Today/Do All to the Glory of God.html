      <p><strong>Temperate in All Things</strong></p>
      <p>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 1 Corinthians 10:31</p>
      <p>In order to preserve health, temperance in all things is <nobr>necessary–temperance</nobr> in labor, temperance
          in eating and drinking. Our heavenly Father sent the light of health reform ... that those who love purity and
          holiness may know how to use with discretion the good things He has provided for them, and that by exercising
          temperance in daily life they may be sanctiﬁed through the truth.</p>
      <p>Great care should be taken to form right habits of eating and drinking. The food eaten should be that which
          will make the best blood. The delicate organs of digestion should be respected. God requires us, by being
          temperate in all things, to act our part toward keeping ourselves in health.... The spiritual experience
          is</p>
      <p>greatly affected by the way in which the stomach is treated. Eating and drinking in accordance with the laws of
          health promote virtuous actions.</p>
      <p>Principle should rule instead of appetite or fancy.... It means much to be true</p>
      <p>to God. He has claims upon all who are engaged in His service. He desires that mind and body be preserved in
          the best condition of health, every power and endowment under the divine control, and as vigorous as careful,
          strictly temperate habits can make them.... Temperance in eating, drinking, sleeping, and dressing is</p>
      <p>one of the grand principles of the religious life. Truth brought into the sanctuary of the soul will guide in
          the treatment of the body.</p>
      <p>The better you observe the laws of health, the more clearly can you discern temptations, and resist them, and
          the more clearly can you discern the value of eternal things. May the Lord help you to make the most of your
          present opportunities and privileges, that you may daily gain new victories, and ﬁnally enter the city of God,
          as those who have overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.</p>
