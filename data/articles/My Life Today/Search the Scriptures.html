      <p><strong>The Bible in My Life</strong></p>
      <p>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments and his
          ways past ﬁnding out. Romans 11:33 In the Scriptures thousands of gems of truth lie hidden from the surface
          seeker. The mine of truth is never exhausted. The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the
          greater will be your interest, and the more you will feel like exclaiming with Paul: “O the depth of the
          riches both of the wisdom and</p>
      <p>knowledge of God! ...”</p>
      <p>Every day you should learn something new from the Scriptures. Search them as for hid treasures, for they
          contain the words of eternal life. Pray for wisdom and understanding to comprehend these holy writings. If you
          would do this, you would ﬁnd new glories in the Word of God; you would feel that you had received new and
          precious light on subjects connected with the truth, and the Scriptures would be constantly receiving a new
          value in your estimation.</p>
      <p>The great truths necessary for salvation are made as clear as noonday.... A</p>
      <p>single text has proved in the past, and will prove in the future, to be a savor of life unto life to many a
          soul. As men diligently search, the Bible opens new treasures of truth, which are as bright jewels to the
          mind.</p>
      <p>You must dig deep in the mine of truth if you would ﬁnd its richest treasures. Comparing scripture with
          scripture, you may ﬁnd the true meaning of the text; but if you do not make the sacred teachings of God’s Word
          the rule and guide of your life, the truth will be nothing to you.... If any part of God’s Word condemns</p>
      <p>any habit you have cherished, any feeling you have indulged, any spirit you have manifested, turn not from the
          Word of God; but turn away from the evil of your doings, and let Jesus cleanse and sanctify your heart.</p>
