    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My Body Belongs to God</strong></p>
      <p>Perfect Health</p>
      <p>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye
          are not your own? for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
          which are God’s. 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</p>
      <p>Life is a gift of God. Our bodies have been given us to use in God’s service, and He desires that we shall care
          for and appreciate them. Our bodies must be kept in the best possible condition physically, and under the most
          spiritual inﬂuences....</p>
      <p>A pure, healthy life is most favorable for the perfection of Christian character and for the development of the
          powers of mind and body.</p>
      <p>The law of temperance must control the life of every Christian. God is to be in all our thoughts; His glory is
          ever to be kept in view. We must break away from every inﬂuence that would captivate our thoughts and lead us
          from God. We are under sacred obligations to God so to govern our bodies and rule our appetites and passions
          that they will not lead us away from purity and holiness, or take our minds from the work God requires us to
          do.</p>
      <p>Those who serve God in sincerity and truth will be a peculiar people, unlike the world, separate from the
          world. Their food will be prepared, not to encourage gluttony or gratify a perverted taste, but to secure to
          themselves the greatest physical strength, and consequently the best mental conditions....</p>
      <p>Our heavenly Father has bestowed upon us the great blessing of health reform, that we may glorify Him by
          obeying the claims He has upon us....</p>
      <p>The harmonious, healthy action of all the powers of body and mind results in happiness; the more elevated and
          reﬁned the powers, the more pure and unalloyed the happiness.</p>
