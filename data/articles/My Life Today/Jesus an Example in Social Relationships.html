      <p><strong>Jesus an Example in Social Relationships</strong></p>
      <p>Social to Save</p>
      <p>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: and both Jesus
          was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. John 2:1, 2</p>
      <p>There was to be a marriage in Cana of Galilee. The parties were relatives of Joseph and Mary. Christ knew of
          this family gathering, and that many inﬂuential persons would be brought together there, so, in company with
          his newly made disciples, He made His way to Cana. As soon as it was known that Jesus had come to the place, a
          special invitation was sent to Him and His friends....</p>
      <p>He had joined the mixed assembly of a festal gathering, and, while no shadow of worldly levity marred His
          conduct, He had sanctioned the social gathering with His presence.</p>
      <p>Here is a lesson for the disciples of Christ through all time, not to exclude themselves from society,
          renouncing all social communion and seeking a strict seclusion from their fellow beings. In order to reach all
          classes, we must meet them where they are; for they will seldom seek us of their own accord. Not alone from
          the pulpit are the hearts of men and women touched by divine truth. Christ awakened their interest by going
          among them as one who desired their good. He sought them at their daily avocations and manifested an unfeigned
          interest in their temporal affairs. He carried His instructions into the household of the people, bringing
          whole families in their own homes under the inﬂuence of His divine presence....</p>
      <p>Jesus rebuked intemperance, <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> and folly; yet He was social in His nature. He
          accepted invitations to dine with the learned and noble, as well as the poor and afﬂicted.... He gave no
          license to scenes of dissipation and revelry,</p>
      <p>yet innocent happiness was pleasing to Him. A Jewish marriage was a solemn and impressive occasion, the
          pleasure and joy of which were not displeasing to the Son of man.</p>
