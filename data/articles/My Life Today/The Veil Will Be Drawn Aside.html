    <h1>The Veil Will Be Drawn Aside</h1>

      <p><strong>All Life´s Expiriences Will Be Made Plain</strong></p>
      <p>Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. 1 Corinthians 13:12</p>
      <p>There, when the veil that darkens our vision shall be removed, and our eyes shall behold that world of beauty
          of which we now catch glimpses through the microscope; when we look on the glories of the heavens, now scanned
          afar through the telescope; when, the blight of sin removed, the whole earth shall appear “in the beauty of
          the Lord our God,” what a ﬁeld will be open to our study! There the student of science may read the records of
          creation, and discern no reminders of the law of evil. He may listen to the music of nature’s voices, and
          detect no note of wailing or undertone of sorrow. In all created things he may trace one
          <nobr>handwriting–in</nobr> the vast universe behold “God’s name writ large,” and not in earth or sea or sky
          one sign of ill remaining....</p>
      <p>There will be open to the student history of inﬁnite scope and of wealth inexpressible. Here, from the vantage
          ground of God’s Word, the student is afforded a view of the vast ﬁeld of history, and may gain some knowledge
          of the principles that govern the course of human events. But his vision is still clouded and his knowledge
          incomplete. Not until he stands in the light of eternity will he see all things clearly....</p>
      <p>The veil that interposes between the visible and the invisible world will be drawn aside, and wonderful things
          will be revealed....</p>
      <p>There all who have wrought with unselﬁsh spirit will behold the fruit of their labors. The outworking of every
          right principle and noble deed will be seen....</p>
      <p>How little of the result of the world’s noblest work is in this life manifest to the doer! ... Parents and
          teachers lie down in their last sleep, their lifework seeming to have been wrought in vain; they know not that
          their faithfulness has unsealed springs of blessing that can never cease to ﬂow ... , and the inﬂuence repeat
          itself a thousandfold.... In the hereafter the action and reaction of all these will be seen.</p>
