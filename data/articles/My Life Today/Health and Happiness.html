      <p><strong>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</strong></p>
      <p>I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart
          is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my ﬂesh also shall rest in hope. Psalm 16:8, 9</p>
      <p>The Christian should live so near to God that he may approve things that are excellent, “being ﬁlled with the
          fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.” His heart should be
          attuned to gratitude and praise. He should be ever ready to acknowledge the blessings he is receiving,
          remembering who it is that has said, “Whoso offereth praise gloriﬁeth me.” ...</p>
      <p>It is the duty of every one to cultivate cheerfulness instead of brooding over sorrow and troubles. Many not
          only make themselves wretched in this way, but they sacriﬁce health and happiness to a morbid imagination.
          There are things in their surroundings that are not agreeable, and their countenances wear a continual frown
          that, more plainly than words, expresses discontent. These depressing emotions are a great injury to them
          healthwise, for by hindering the process of digestion they interfere with nutrition. While grief and anxiety
          cannot remedy a single evil, they can do great harm; but cheerfulness and hope, while they brighten the
          pathway of others, “are life unto those that ﬁnd them, and health to all their ﬂesh.”</p>
      <p>Christ came to restore to its original loveliness a world ruined by sin.... In the</p>
      <p>new earth there will be no sin nor disease.... And the body will be restored to its</p>
      <p>original perfection. We shall wear the spotless image of our Lord....</p>
      <p>The development of Christian character, tending toward this state of perfection, is a growth toward beauty....
          As the heart becomes transformed by</p>
      <p>the renewing of the mind, the graces of the Spirit leave their impress on the face, and it expresses the
          reﬁnement, delicacy, peace, benevolence, and pure and tender love that reign in the heart....</p>

      <p>Give “thanks always for all things unto God.”</p>
