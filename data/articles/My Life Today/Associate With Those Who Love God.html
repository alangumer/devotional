      <p><strong>Recreation and Amusements</strong></p>
      <p>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. Psalm 119:63</p>
      <p>Between the associations of the followers of Christ for Christian recreation and worldly gatherings for
          pleasure and amusement, will exist a marked contrast. Instead of prayer and the mentioning of Christ and
          sacred things, will be heard from the lips of worldlings the silly laugh and the triﬂing conversation. Their
          idea is to have a general high time. Their amusements commence in folly and end in vanity. We want in our
          gatherings to have them so conducted, and to so conduct ourselves, that when we return to our homes we can
          have a conscience void of offense toward God and man; a consciousness that we have not wounded or injured in
          any manner those with whom we have associated or had an injurious inﬂuence over them.</p>
      <p>We are of that class who believe that it is our privilege every day of our lives to glorify God upon the earth;
          that we are not to live in this world merely for our own amusement, merely to please ourselves. We are here to
          beneﬁt humanity and to be a blessing to society.</p>
      <p>Those who truly love God will not cultivate the society of those who do not love Jesus. They will ﬁnd that
          Christian society and conversation is food to the soul, that in the society of those who love God they breathe
          in the atmosphere of heaven. Christians will exercise love and sympathy one for another. The encouragement
          given one to another, the esteem manifested one for another, the helps, the instruction, the reproofs,
          warnings, the Christian counsel that should be found among the followers of Christ will further them in the
          spiritual life; for Christian fellowship is according to God’s plan.... They will have tender</p>
      <p>consideration for all of like precious faith, and will draw toward those who love God. There will be fellowship
          such as the world knows not of.</p>
