      <p><strong>Highways to Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
          prophets. Matthew 7:12</p>
      <p>The Saviour taught this principle [the golden rule] to make mankind happy, not unhappy; for in no other way can
          happiness come. God desires men and women to live the higher life. He gives them the boon of life, not to
          enable them merely to gain wealth, but to improve their higher powers by doing the work He has entrusted to
          <nobr>mankind–the</nobr> work of searching out and relieving the necessities of their fellow men. Man should
          not work for his own selﬁsh interest, but for the interest of every one about him, blessing others by his
          inﬂuence and kindly deeds. This purpose of God is exempliﬁed in Christ’s life.</p>
      <p>Seize every opportunity to contribute to the happiness of those around you, sharing with them your affection.
          Words of kindness, looks of sympathy, expression of appreciation, would to many a struggling, lonely one be as
          a cup of cold water to a thirsty soul. A word of cheer, an act of kindness, would go far to lighten the
          burdens that are resting heavily upon weary shoulders. It is in unselﬁsh ministry that true happiness is
          found. And every word and deed of such service is recorded in the books of heaven as done to Christ.... Live
          in the sunshine</p>
      <p>of Christ’s love. Then your inﬂuence will bless the world.</p>
      <p>The spirit of unselﬁsh labor for others gives depth, stability, and Christlike loveliness to the character and
          brings peace and happiness to its possessor.</p>
      <p>Every duty performed, every sacriﬁce made in the name of Jesus brings an exceeding great reward. In the very
          act of duty, God speaks and gives His blessing.</p>
