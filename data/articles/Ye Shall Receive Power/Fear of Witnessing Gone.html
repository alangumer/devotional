    <h1>Fear of Witnessing Gone</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have
          ﬁlled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us. Then Peter and the other
          apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. Acts 5:28, 29.</strong></p>
      <p>I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth in great power. It had effect. I saw those who had
          been bound; some wives had been bound by their husbands, and some children had been bound by their parents.
          The honest who had been held or prevented from hearing the truth now eagerly laid hold of the truth spoken.
          All fear of their relatives was gone. The truth alone was exalted to them. It was dearer and more precious
          than life. They had been hungering and thirsting for truth. I asked what had made this great change. An angel
          answered, “It is the latter rain. The refreshing from the presence of the Lord. The loud cry of the third
          angel.”</p>
      <p>Great power was with these chosen ones. Said the angel, “Look ye!” My attention was turned to the wicked, or
          unbelievers. They were all astir. The zeal and power with the people of God had aroused and enraged them.
          Confusion, confusion was on every side. I saw measures taken against this company, who were having the power
          and light of God. Darkness thickened around them, yet there they stood, approved of God, and trusting in Him.
          I saw them perplexed.</p>
      <p>Next I heard them crying unto God earnestly. Through the day and night their cry ceased not. I heard these
          words, “Thy will, O God, be done! If it can glorify Thy name, make a way of escape for Thy people! Deliver us
          from the heathen round about us! They have appointed us unto death; but Thine arm can bring salvation.” These
          are all the words I can bring to mind. They seemed to have a deep sense of their unworthiness, and manifested
          entire submission to the will of God. Yet everyone, without an exception, was earnestly pleading, and
          wrestling like Jacob for <nobr>deliverance.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 31, 1857.</p>
