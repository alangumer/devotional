    <h1>Joy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. I will be
          glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. Psalm 9:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>We must have more faith. Let us begin to believe unto salvation. Let us come to God in faith, fully assured
          that as we surrender all to Him, He will make us Christlike in character. We must tell this to all over and
          over again. Then, one with Christ, we can reveal Him to the world. Then all our ﬁtful, haphazard work will
          cease.</p>
      <p>Let us honor God by showing ﬁrm faith and unswerving trust. Let us remember that He is not gloriﬁed by the
          manifestation of a fretful, unhappy spirit. The Lord cares for the ﬂowers. He gives them beauty and fragrance.
          Will He not much more give us the fragrance of a cheerful disposition? Will He not restore in us the divine
          image? Then let us have faith in Him. Let us now, just now, place ourselves where He can give us His Holy
          Spirit. Then we can give to the world a revelation of what true religion does for men and women. The joy of a
          Saviour ﬁlling our hearts gives us that peace and conﬁdence which enables us to say, “I know that my Redeemer
          liveth” (Job 19:25).</p>
      <p>In His Word the Lord has made it plain that His people are a joyful people. True faith reaches up the hand and
          lays hold upon the One who is behind the promise “Great shall be the peace of thy children” (Isaiah 54:13).
          “Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river” (Isaiah 66:12). “Behold I create
          Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy” (Isaiah 65:18). In God we may “rejoice with joy unspeakable and
          full of glory” (1 Peter 1:8). “Men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed” (Psalm 72:17).
          Let us strive to educate the believers to rejoice in the Lord. Spiritual joy is the result of active faith.
          God’s people are to be full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. Then He will be gloriﬁed in
          <nobr>them.—Bible</nobr> Training School, April 1, 1905.</p>
