    <h1>Nothing More Invincible</h1>

      <p><strong>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians
          15:57.</strong></p>
      <p>The Christian life is a life of constant conﬂict. It is a battle and a march. Every act of obedience, every
          deed of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> every trial bravely endured, every temptation resisted, every victory
          gained, is a step forward in the march to eternal triumph.</p>
      <p>There is hope for man. Christ says, “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I
          also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne” (Revelation 3:21). But let us never forget that
          the efforts we make in our own strength are utterly worthless. Our strength is weakness; our judgment
          foolishness. Only in the name and strength of our Conqueror can we conquer. When we are pressed with
          temptation, when <nobr>un-christlike</nobr> desires clamor for the mastery, let us offer fervent, importunate
          prayer to the heavenly Father, in the name of Christ. This will bring divine aid. In the Redeemer’s name we
          may gain the victory.</p>
      <p>As, seeing the sinfulness of sin, we fall helpless before the cross, asking forgiveness and strength, our
          prayer is heard and answered. Those who present their petitions to God in Christ’s name will never be turned
          away. The Lord says, “Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out” (John 6:37). “He will regard the
          prayer of the destitute” (Psalm 102:17). Our help comes from Him who holds all things in His hands. The peace
          that He sends is the assurance of His love to us.</p>
      <p>Nothing can be more helpless and yet more invincible than the soul that feel its nothingness, and relies wholly
          upon the merits of a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour. God would send every angel in heaven to the aid of the one
          who places his whole dependence on Christ, rather than allow him to be overcome.</p>
      <p>If we accept Christ as our Guide, He will lead us safely along the narrow way. The road may be rough and
          thorny, and the ascent steep and dangerous; there may be pitfalls on the right hand and on the left. When
          weary and longing for rest, we may have to toil on; when faint, we may have to ﬁght; but with Christ as our
          guide, we shall not fail of reaching <nobr>heaven.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, October 29, 1902.</p>
