      <p><strong>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit. 1 Corinthians
          12:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Faith, too, is the gift of God. Faith is the assent of man’s understanding to God’s words, that binds the heart
          to God’s service. And whose is man’s understanding, if it be not God’s? Whose the heart, if it be not God’s?
          To have faith is to render to God the intellect, the energy, that we have received from Him; therefore those
          who exercise faith do not themselves deserve any credit. Those who believe so ﬁrmly in a heavenly Father that
          they can trust Him with unlimited conﬁdence; those who by faith can reach beyond the grave to the eternal
          realities beyond, must pour forth to their Maker the confession “All things come of thee, and of thine own
          have we given thee” (1 Chronicles 29:14).</p>
      <p>No man has a right to call himself his own. And no man possesses any good thing that he can call his own. Every
          man, every thing, is the property of the Lord. All that man receives from the bounty of heaven is still the
          Lord’s. Whatever knowledge he has that in any way helps him to be an intelligent workman in God’s cause is
          from the Lord, and should be imparted by him to his fellow men, in order that they, too, may become valuable
          workmen. He to whom God has entrusted unusual gifts should return to the Lord’s storehouse that which he has
          received, by freely giving to others the beneﬁt of his blessings. Thus God will be honored and
          gloriﬁed....</p>
      <p>Heavenly bestowed capabilities should not be made to serve selﬁsh ends. Every energy, every endowment, is a
          talent that should contribute to God’s glory by being used in His service. His gifts are to be put out to the
          exchangers, that He may receive His own, with usury. The talents that ﬁt a man for service are entrusted to
          him not only that he may be an acceptable worker himself, but that he may also be enabled to teach others who
          in some respects are <nobr>deﬁcient.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 1, 1904.</p>
