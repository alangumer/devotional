    <h1>Traveling With the Missionaries</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the
          work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they
          sent them away. So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they
          sailed to Cyprus. Acts <nobr>13:2-4.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Oh, how we need the divine Presence! For the baptism of the Holy Spirit, every worker should be breathing out
          his prayers to God. Companies should be gathered together to call upon God for special help, for heavenly
          wisdom, that the people of God may know how to plan and devise and execute the work. Especially should men
          pray that the Lord will choose His agents, and baptize His missionaries with the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>For ten days the disciples prayed before the Pentecostal blessing came. It needed all that time to bring them
          to an understanding of what is meant to offer effectual prayer, drawing nearer and nearer to God, confessing
          their sins, humbling their hearts before God, and by faith beholding Jesus, and becoming changed into His
          image. When the blessing did come, it ﬁlled all the place where they were assembled; and endowed with power,
          they went forth to do effectual work for the Master.</p>
      <p>We should pray as earnestly for the descent of the Holy Spirit as the disciples prayed on the day of Pentecost.
          If they needed [the Spirit] at that time, we need it more today. Moral darkness, like a funeral pall, covers
          the earth. All manner of false doctrines, heresies, and satanic deceptions are misleading the minds of men.
          Without the Spirit and power of God, it will be in vain that we labor to present the truth. We must have the
          Holy Spirit to sustain us in the conﬂict; “for we wrestle not against ﬂesh and blood, but against
          principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
          in high places” (Ephesians 6:12).</p>
      <p>We cannot fall as long as we hope and trust in God. Let every soul of us, ministers and people, say, as did
          Paul, “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so ﬁght I, not as one that beateth the air” (1 Corinthians
          9:26), but with a holy faith and hope, in expectation of winning the <nobr>prize.—The</nobr> Home Missionary,
          November 1, 1893.</p>
