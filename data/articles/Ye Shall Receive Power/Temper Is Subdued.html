    <h1>Temper Is Subdued</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew out of a good conversation his
          works with meekness of wisdom. James 3:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Meekness in the school of Christ is one of the marked fruits of the Spirit. It is a grace wrought by the Holy
          Spirit as a sanctiﬁer, and enables its possessor at all times to control a rash and impetuous temper. When the
          grace of meekness is cherished by those who are naturally sour or hasty in disposition, they will put forth
          the most earnest efforts to subdue their unhappy temper. Every day they will gain <nobr>self-control,</nobr>
          until that which is unlovely and unlike Jesus is conquered. They become assimilated to the divine Pattern,
          until they can obey the inspired injunction, “Be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath” (James
          1:19).</p>
      <p>When a man professes to be sanctiﬁed, and yet in words and works may be represented by the impure fountain
          sending forth its bitter waters, we may safely say, that man is deceived. He needs to learn the very alphabet
          of what constitutes the life of a Christian. Some who profess to be servants to Christ have so long cherished
          the demon of unkindness that they seem to love the unhallowed element, and to take pleasure in speaking words
          that displease and irritate. These men must be converted, before Christ will acknowledge them as His
          children.</p>
      <p>Meekness is the inward adorning, which God estimates as of great price. The apostle speaks of this as more
          excellent and valuable than gold, or pearls, or costly array. While the outward adorning beautiﬁes only the
          mortal body, the ornament of meekness adorns the soul, and connects ﬁnite man with the inﬁnite God. This is
          the ornament of God’s own choice. He who garnished the heavens with the orbs of light has by the same Spirit
          promised that He will “beautify the meek with salvation” (Psalm 149:4). Angels of heaven will register as best
          adorned, those who put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and walk with Him in meekness and lowliness of
          <nobr>mind.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 18, 1881.</p>
