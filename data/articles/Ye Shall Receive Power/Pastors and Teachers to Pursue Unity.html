      <p><strong>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
          for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till
          we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
          measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Ephesians <nobr>4:11-13.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has given to those who should be His human agents talents of means, capacity, and inﬂuence, according
          to their ability to employ these gifts in a wise manner for His service. He has given to every man his work.
          “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.”</p>
      <p>Why were these various workers appointed? “For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for
          the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the
          Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ: that we henceforth
          be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men,
          and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into
          him in all things, which is the head, even Christ” (Ephesians <nobr>4:12-15).</nobr></p>
      <p>We can see from this scripture that the Lord has His appointed workers, and that the work committed unto them
          has in view a deﬁnite object. Prophets, apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, are all to work for the
          perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Is not this
          object worthy of careful attention? Can we not discern that there has been neglect in some special work for
          the church, in that the saints have not attained the perfection that God would have them attain? Had the work
          of the ministry been done, the church would have been ediﬁed, and educated for the great work that devolves
          upon them. The truth would have been presented in such a way that the Spirit of the Lord would have moved upon
          hearts, and sinners would have been convicted and converted, and would have taken their position as followers
          of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 7, 1893.</p>
