    <h1>Beware of Resisting</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that
          they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. And they departed from the presence of the
          council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. Acts 5:40, 41.</strong></p>
      <p>When God moves upon the hearts of men to draw them to Christ, it seems that a compelling power comes over them,
          and they believe, and give themselves up to the inﬂuence of the Spirit of God. But if they do not maintain the
          precious victory that God has given; if they permit old practices and habits to revive, and indulge in
          amusement or worldly luxury; if they neglect prayer, and cease resisting evil, then Satan’s temptations are
          accepted, and they are led to doubt the verity of their former experience. They ﬁnd that they are weak in
          moral power, and Satan declares to them that it is of no use for them to try the experiment of living a
          Christian life. He says, “The experience you thought was of God was only the result of undue emotion and
          impulse.”</p>
      <p>As soon as the human agent entertains these suggestions of the evil one, they begin to appear plausible, and
          then those who ought to know better, who have had a longer experience in the work of God, second the
          suggestions of Satan, and the Holy Spirit is grieved from the soul. There are those who almost imperceptibly
          come to take this position, who will immediately recover themselves when they realize what they are doing; but
          there are others who will continue to resist the Holy Spirit, until resistance appears to them as a
          virtue.</p>
      <p>It is a dangerous thing to doubt the manifestations of the Holy Spirit; for if this agency is doubted, there is
          no reserve power left by which to operate on the human heart. Those who attribute the work of the Holy Spirit
          to human agencies, saying that an undue inﬂuence was brought to bear upon them, are cutting their souls off
          from the fountain of <nobr>blessing.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 13, 1894.</p>
