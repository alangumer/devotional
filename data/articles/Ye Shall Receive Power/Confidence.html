    <h1>Conﬁdence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Cast not away therefore your conﬁdence, which hath great recompence of reward. Hebrews 10:35. John
          says, “This is the conﬁdence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth
          us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of
          him” (1 John 5:14, 15). Let us dwell much upon these points before the people, that their ideas may be
          enlarged, their faith increased. They should be encouraged to ask largely, and expect without a doubt the
          riches of His grace; for through Jesus we can come into the audience chamber of the Most High.

      <p>His merits we have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</p>
      <p>Oh, that we may have a deeper experience in prayer! With conﬁdence we may come to God, knowing what it is to
          have the presence and power of His Holy Spirit. We may confess our sins, and right there, while asking, know
          that He pardons our transgressions, because He has promised to forgive. We must exercise faith, and manifest
          true earnestness and humility. We can never do this without the grace of the Holy Spirit. We must lie low at
          the feet of Jesus, and cherish no selﬁshness, reveal no <nobr>self-uplifting,</nobr> but in simplicity seek
          the Lord, asking for His Holy Spirit as a little child asks bread of his parents.</p>
      <p>We should act our part, take Christ as our personal Saviour, and, standing under the cross of Calvary, “Look
          and live.” God sets His children apart for Himself. And as they connect themselves with Him, they have power
          with God, and prevail. Of ourselves we can do nothing; but through the grace of His Holy Spirit, life and
          light are imparted, and the soul is ﬁlled with longing, earnest desire for God, for holiness. Then it is that
          Christ leads us to the throne of grace, and clothes us with His righteousness; for the Lord God of heaven
          loves us. We would be willfully blind and stubborn to doubt that His heart is toward us. While Jesus, our
          Intercessor, pleads for us in heaven, the Holy Spirit works in us, to will and to do of His good pleasure. All
          heaven is interested in the salvation of the soul. Then what reason have we to doubt that the Lord will and
          does help <nobr>us?—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, October 3, 1892.</p>
