    <h1>Thankfulness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 1 Thessalonians
          5:18.</strong></p>
      <p>There is much needless worrying, much trouble of mind, over things that cannot be helped. The Lord would have
          His children put their trust fully in Him. Our Lord is a just and righteous God. His children should
          acknowledge His goodness and His justice in the large and the small things of life. Those who cherish the
          spirit of worry and complaint are refusing to recognize His guiding hand. Needless anxiety is a foolish thing;
          and it hinders us from standing in a true position before God.</p>
      <p>When the Holy Spirit comes into the soul, there will be no desire to complain and murmur because we do not have
          everything we want; rather, we will thank God from a full heart for the blessings that we have. There is great
          need of more thankfulness among our workers today; and until they have this spirit they will be unprepared for
          a place in the kingdom of heaven. There is a mighty work to be done for every one of us. We comprehend but
          little of what God desires to work out through us. We should seek to realize the breadth of His plans, and
          proﬁt by every lesson that He [has] tried to teach us.</p>
      <p>A great deal of mischief is wrought in the imagination of our own hearts and minds when we seek to carry our
          own way contrary to the law of kindness. Here is where many fail. We do not cultivate a disposition to
          kindness; we want everything to come in an easy way to ourselves. But the question of greatest importance to
          each one of us should be not how we can carry our own plans against the plans of others, but how we can have
          the power to live for Christ every day. Christ came to earth and gave His life that we might have eternal
          salvation. He wants to encircle each of us with the atmosphere of heaven, that we may give to the world an
          example that will honor the religion of <nobr>Christ.—Loma</nobr> Linda Messages, 602.</p>
