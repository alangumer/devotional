    <h1>Welfare Ministry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the
          gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the
          multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep
          having no shepherd. Matthew 9:35, 36.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord continually performed deeds of loving ministry, and this every minister of the gospel should do. He
          has appointed us to be His ambassadors, to carry forward His work in the world. To every true,
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> worker is given the commission “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel
          to every creature” (Mark 16:15).</p>
      <p>Read carefully the instruction given in the New Testament. The work that the great Teacher did in connection
          with His disciples is the example we are to follow in our medical missionary work. But have we followed this
          example? The glad tidings of salvation are to be proclaimed in every village, town, and city. But where are
          the missionaries? In the name of God I ask, Where are the laborers together with God?</p>
      <p>It is only by an unselﬁsh interest in those in need of help that we can give a practical demonstration of the
          truths of the gospel. “If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto
          them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and ﬁlled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful
          to the body; what doth it proﬁt? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone” (James
          <nobr>2:15-17).</nobr> “And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is
          charity” (1 Corinthians 13:13).</p>
      <p>Much more than mere sermonizing is included in preaching the gospel. The ignorant are to be enlightened; the
          discouraged are to be uplifted; the sick are to be healed. The human voice is to act its part in God’s work.
          Words of tenderness, sympathy, and love are to witness to the truth. Earnest, heartfelt prayers are to bring
          the angels near.</p>
      <p>The evangelization of the world is the work that God has given to those who go forth in His name. They are to
          be colaborers with Christ, revealing to those ready to perish His tender, pitying <nobr>love.—The</nobr>
          Review and Herald, March 4, 1902.</p>
