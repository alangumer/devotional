    <h1>Abiding in Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no
          more can ye, except ye abide in me. John 15:4.</strong></p>
      <p>We need to pray for the impartation of the divine Spirit as the remedy for <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> souls. The
          surface truths of revelation, made plain and easy to be understood, are accepted by many as supplying all that
          is essential; but the Holy Spirit, working upon the mind, awakens an earnest desire for truth uncorrupted by
          error. He who is really desirous to know what is truth cannot remain in ignorance; for precious truth rewards
          the diligent seeker. We need to feel the converting power of God’s grace, and I urge all who have closed their
          heart against God’s Spirit to unlock the door, and plead earnestly, Abide with me. Why should we not prostrate
          ourselves at the throne of divine grace, praying that God’s Spirit may be poured out upon us as it was upon
          the disciples? Its presence will soften our hard hearts, and ﬁll us with joy and rejoicing, transforming us
          into channels of blessing.</p>
      <p>The Lord would have every one of His children rich in faith, and this faith is the fruit of the working of the
          Holy Spirit upon the mind. It dwells with each soul who will receive it, speaking to the impenitent in words
          of warning, and pointing them to Jesus, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. It causes
          light to shine into the minds of those who are seeking to cooperate with God, giving them efﬁciency and wisdom
          to do His work.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit never leaves unassisted a soul who is looking to Jesus. It takes of the things of Christ, and
          shows them to the seeker. And if the eye is kept ﬁxed upon Jesus, the work of the Spirit ceases not until the
          soul is conformed to His image. Through the gracious inﬂuence of the Spirit the sinner is changed in spirit
          and purpose, till he becomes one with Christ. His affection for God increases; he hungers and thirsts for
          righteousness, and by beholding Christ he is changed from glory to glory, from character to character, and
          becomes more and more like his <nobr>Master.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September 27, 1899.</p>
