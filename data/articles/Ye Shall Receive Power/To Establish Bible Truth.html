    <h1>To Establish Bible Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
          revelation in the knowledge of him. Ephesians 1:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The truths that have been unfolding in their order, as we have advanced along the line of prophecy revealed in
          the Word of God, are truth, sacred, eternal truth today. Those who passed over the ground step by step in the
          past history of our experience, seeing the chain of truth in the prophecies, were prepared to accept and obey
          every ray of light. They were praying, fasting, searching, digging for the truth as for hidden treasures, and
          the Holy Spirit, we know, was teaching and guiding us.</p>
      <p>Many theories were advanced, bearing a semblance of truth, but so mingled with misinterpreted and misapplied
          scriptures that they led to dangerous errors. Very well do we know how every point of truth was established,
          and the seal set upon it by the Holy Spirit of God. And all the time voices were heard, “Here is the truth,”
          “I have the truth; follow me.” But the warnings came, “Go not ye after them. I have not sent them, but they
          ran” (see Jeremiah 23:21.)</p>
      <p>The leadings of the Lord were marked, and most wonderful were His revelations of what is truth. Point after
          point was established by the Lord God of heaven. That which was truth then is truth today. But the voices do
          not cease to be <nobr>heard—“This</nobr> is truth. I have new light.” But these new lights in prophetic lines
          are manifest in misapplying the Word and setting the people of God adrift without an anchor to hold them. If
          the student of the Word would take the truths which God has revealed in the leadings of His people, and
          appropriate these truths, digest them, and bring them into their practical life, they would then be living
          channels of light. But those who have set themselves to study out new theories have a mixture of truth and
          error combined, and, after trying to make these things prominent, have demonstrated that they have not kindled
          their taper from the divine altar, and it has gone out in <nobr>darkness.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 17:4,
          5.</p>
