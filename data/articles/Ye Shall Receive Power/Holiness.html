    <h1>Holiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. Hebrews 12:14. God
          has from eternity chosen men to be holy. “This is the will of God [concerning you], even your sanctiﬁcation”
          (1 Thessalonians 4:3). The echo of His voice comes to us, ever saying, “Holier, holier still.”</strong></p>
      <p>And ever our answer is to be, “Yes, Lord, holier still.”</p>
      <p>No man receives holiness as a birthright, or as a gift from any other human being. Holiness is the gift of God
          through Christ. Those who receive the Saviour become sons of God. They are His spiritual children, born again,
          renewed in righteousness and true holiness. Their minds are changed. With clearer vision they behold eternal
          realities. They are adopted into God’s family, and they become conformed to His likeness, changed by His
          Spirit from glory to glory. From cherishing supreme love for self, they come to cherish supreme love for God
          and for Christ.</p>
      <p>“Being justiﬁed by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). Justiﬁcation
          means pardon. It means that the heart, purged from dead works, is prepared to receive the blessing of
          sanctiﬁcation. God has told us what we must do to receive this blessing. “Work out your own salvation with
          fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Do all
          things without murmuring and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without
          rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world”
          (Philippians <nobr>2:12-15).</nobr></p>
      <p>The love of God, cherished in the heart and revealed in the words and acts, will do more to elevate and ennoble
          human beings than all else can. In the life of Christ, this love found full and complete expression. On the
          cross of Christ the Saviour made an atonement for the fallen race. Holiness is the fruit of this sacriﬁce. It
          is because He has died for us that we are promised this great gift. And Christ longs to bestow this gift on
          us. He longs to make us partakers of His nature. He longs to save those who by sin have separated themselves
          from God. He calls upon them to choose His service, to give themselves wholly into His control, to learn from
          Him how to do God’s <nobr>will.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, December 17, 1902.</p>
