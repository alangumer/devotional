    <h1>Victory Through Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of ﬂesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of
          the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver
          them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. Hebrews 2:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>The fall of man ﬁlled all heaven with sorrow, and the heart of Jesus was moved with inﬁnite compassion for the
          lost world, the ruined race. He beheld man plunged in sin and misery, and knew that he had not moral power to
          overcome in his own behalf the power of his unsleeping enemy. In divine love and pity He came to earth to ﬁght
          our battles for us; for He alone could conquer the adversary. He came to unite man with God, to impart divine
          strength to the repenting soul, and from the manger to Calvary to pass over the path which man would travel,
          at every step giving man a perfect example of what he should do, presenting in His character what humanity
          might become when united with divinity.</p>
      <p>But many say that Jesus was not like us, that He was not as we are in the world, that He was divine, and
          therefore we cannot overcome as He overcame. But this is not true; “for verily he took not on him the nature
          of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.... For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted,
          he</p>
      <p>is able to succour them that are tempted” (Hebrews <nobr>2:16-18).</nobr> Christ knows the sinner’s trials; He
          knows his temptations. He took upon Himself our nature; He was tempted in all points like as we are. He has
          wept, He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</p>
      <p>As a man He lived upon earth. As a man He ascended to heaven. As a man He is the substitute of humanity. As a
          man He liveth to make intercession for us. As a man He will come again with kingly power and glory to receive
          those who love Him, and for whom He is now preparing a place. We should rejoice and give thanks that God “hath
          appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained”
          (Acts <nobr>17:31).—Bible</nobr> Echo, November 1, 1892.</p>
