    <h1>Garment Changed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: and
          he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
          Matthew 22:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>Discard your citizen’s dress, and put on the wedding garment which Christ has prepared. Then you can sit in
          heavenly places with Christ Jesus. God welcomes all who come to Him just as they are, not building themselves
          up in <nobr>self-righteousness,</nobr> not seeking to justify self, not claiming merits for what they call
          good actions, not priding themselves on their supposed knowledge. While you have been walking and working in
          meekness and lowliness of heart, a work has been done for <nobr>you—a</nobr> work that only God could do. It
          is God who works in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure. That good pleasure is to see you abiding
          in Christ, resting in His love.</p>
      <p>Let not anything rob your soul of peace, of restfulness, of the assurance that you are accepted just now. Claim
          every promise; all are yours if you will comply with the prescribed terms. Entire <nobr>self-surrender,</nobr>
          an acceptance of Christ’s ways, is the secret of perfect rest in His love.</p>
      <p>The abiding <nobr>rest—who</nobr> has it? That rest is found when all <nobr>self-justiﬁcation,</nobr> all
          reasoning from a selﬁsh standpoint, is put away. Entire <nobr>self-surrender,</nobr> an acceptance of His
          ways, is the secret of perfect rest in His love. We must learn His meekness and lowliness before we experience
          the fulﬁllment of the promise “Ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:29). It is by learning the
          habits of Christ that self becomes <nobr>transformed—by</nobr> taking His yoke, and then submitting to
          learn.</p>
      <p>Giving up the life to Christ means much more than many suppose. God calls for an entire surrender. We cannot
          receive the Holy Spirit until we break every yoke that binds us to our objectionable traits of character.
          These are the great hindrances to wearing Christ’s yoke and learning of Him. There is no one who has not much
          to learn. All must be trained by <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 25, 1899.</p>
