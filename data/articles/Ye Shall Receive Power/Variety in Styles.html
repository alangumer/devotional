      <p><strong>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
          shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. 2 Peter
          1:19.</strong></p>
      <p>The writers of the Bible had to express their ideas in human language. It was written by human men. These men
          were inspired of the Holy Spirit. Because of the imperfections of human understanding of language, or the
          perversity of the human mind, ingenious in evading truth, many read and understand the Bible to please
          themselves. It is not that the difﬁculty is in the Bible. Opposing politicians argue points of law in the
          statute book, and take opposite views in their application and in these laws.</p>
      <p>The Scriptures were given to men, not in a continuous chain of unbroken utterances, but piece by piece through
          successive generations, as God in His providence saw a ﬁtting opportunity to impress man at sundry times and
          divers places. Men wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. There is “ﬁrst the bud, then the blossom,
          and next the fruit,” “ﬁrst the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear” (Mark 4:28). This is
          exactly what the Bible utterances are to us.</p>
      <p>There is not always perfect order or apparent unity in the Scriptures. The miracles of Christ are not given in
          exact order, but are given just as the circumstances occurred, which called for this divine revealing of the
          power of Christ. The truths of the Bible are as pearls hidden. They must be searched, dug out by painstaking
          effort. Those who take only a surface view of the Scriptures will, with their superﬁcial knowledge, which they
          think is very deep, talk of the contradictions of the Bible, and question the authority of the Scriptures. But
          those whose hearts are in harmony with truth and duty will search the Scriptures with a heart prepared to
          receive divine <nobr>impressions.—Selected</nobr> Messages 1:19, 20.</p>
