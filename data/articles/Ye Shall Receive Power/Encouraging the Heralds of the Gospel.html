      <p><strong>Not that we are sufﬁcient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufﬁciency is of
          God; who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the
          letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 2 Corinthians 3:5, 6.</strong></p>
      <p>Those only who are constantly receiving fresh supplies of grace will have power proportionate to their daily
          need and their ability to use that power. Instead of looking forward to some future time when, through a
          special endowment of spiritual power, they will receive a miraculous ﬁtting up for soul winning, they are
          yielding themselves daily to God, that He may make them vessels meet for His use. Daily they are improving the
          opportunities for service that lie within their reach. Daily they are witnessing for the Master wherever they
          may be, whether in some humble sphere of labor in the home, or in a public ﬁeld of usefulness.</p>
      <p>To the consecrated worker there is wonderful consolation in the knowledge that even Christ during His life on
          earth sought His Father daily for fresh supplies of needed grace; and from this communion with God He went
          forth to strengthen and bless others. Behold the Son of God bowed in prayer to His Father! Though He is the
          Son of God, He strengthens His faith by prayer, and by communion with heaven gathers to Himself power to
          resist evil and to minister to the needs of men.</p>
      <p>As the elder brother of our race He knows the necessities of those who, compassed with inﬁrmity and living in a
          world of sin and temptation, still desire to serve Him. He knows that the messengers whom He sees ﬁt to send
          are weak, erring men; but to all who give themselves wholly to His service He promises divine aid. His own
          example is an assurance that earnest, persevering supplication to God in <nobr>faith—faith</nobr> that leads
          to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved consecration to His <nobr>work—will</nobr> avail to bring to men
          the Holy Spirit’s aid in the battle against <nobr>sin.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 55, 56.</p>
