    <h1>Kindness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. Proverbs 31:26. The Lord
          will help every one of us where we need help the most in the grand work of overcoming and</strong></p>
      <p>conquering self. Let the law of kindness be upon your lips and the oil of grace in your heart. This will
          produce wonderful results. You will be tender, sympathetic, courteous. You need all these graces. The Holy
          Spirit must be received and brought into your character; then it will be as holy ﬁre, giving forth incense
          which will rise up to God, not from lips that condemn, but as a healer of the souls of men. Your countenance
          will express the image of the divine.</p>
      <p>No sharp, critical, blunt, or severe words should be spoken. This is common ﬁre, and must be left out of all
          our councils and intercourse with our brethren. God requires every soul in His service to kindle their censers
          from the coals of sacred ﬁre. The common, severe, harsh words that come from your lips so readily must be
          withheld, and the Spirit of God speak through the human agent. By beholding the character of Christ you will
          become changed into His likeness. The grace of Christ alone can change your heart and then you will reﬂect the
          image of the Lord Jesus. God calls upon us to be like <nobr>Him—pure,</nobr> holy, and undeﬁled. We are to
          bear the divine <nobr>image.—The</nobr> SDA Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments, vol. 3, 1164.</p>
      <p>We may talk of the blessings of the Holy Spirit, and pray in regard to receiving them; but unless the human
          agent is worked by the Spirit of God, He reveals that he has Him not. When the Spirit molds and fashions the
          character after the divine similitude, He will be unmistakably revealed in every word we speak and in
          everything we do, showing to the world that there is a marked difference between the children of light and the
          children of darkness. The Lord wants us to stand stifﬂy for the faith once delivered to the saints. We are to
          speak the truth in love. Our great Teacher says, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and
          lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew
          11:29, <nobr>30).—Letter</nobr> 84, 1899.</p>
