    <h1>Self Cruciﬁed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am cruciﬁed with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which
          I now live in the ﬂesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Galatians
          2:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Candidly and seriously we are to consider the question, Have we humbled ourselves before God, that the Holy
          Spirit may work through us with transforming power? As children of God, it is our privilege to be worked by
          His Spirit. When self is cruciﬁed, the Holy Spirit takes the brokenhearted ones, and makes them vessels unto
          honor. They are in His hands as clay in the hands of the potter. Jesus Christ will make such men and women
          superior in mental, physical, and moral power. The graces of the Spirit will give solidity to the character.
          They will exert an inﬂuence for good because Christ is abiding in the soul.</p>
      <p>Unless this converting power shall go through our churches, unless the revival of the Spirit of God shall come,
          all their profession will never make the members of the church Christians. There are sinners in Zion who need
          to repent of sins that have been cherished as precious treasures. Until these sins are seen, and thrust from
          the soul, until every faulty, unlovely trait of character is transformed by the Spirit’s inﬂuence, God cannot
          manifest Himself in power. There is more hope for the open sinner than for the professedly righteous who are
          not pure, holy, and undeﬁled....</p>
      <p>Who is willing to take himself in hand? Who is willing to lay his ﬁnger upon his cherished idols of sin, and
          allow Christ to purify the temple by casting out the buyers and sellers? Who is prepared to allow Jesus to
          enter the soul and cleanse it from everything that tarnishes or corrupts? The standard is “Be ye therefore
          perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). God calls upon men and women to
          empty their hearts of self. Then His Spirit can ﬁnd unobstructed entrance. Stop trying to do the work
          yourself. Ask God to work in and through you until the words of the apostle become yours, “I live; yet not I,
          but Christ liveth in <nobr>me.”—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 1:366, 367.</p>
