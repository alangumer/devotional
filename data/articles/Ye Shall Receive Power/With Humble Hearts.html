    <h1>With Humble Hearts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high
          and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and
          to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Isaiah 57:15.</strong></p>
      <p>All who will come to the Word of God for guidance, with humble, inquiring minds, determined to know the terms
          of salvation, will understand what saith the Scriptures. But those who bring to the investigation of the Word
          a spirit which it does not approve will take away from the search a spirit which it has not imparted. The Lord
          will not speak to a mind that is unconcerned. He wastes not His instruction on one who is willingly irreverent
          or polluted. But the tempter educates every mind that yields itself to his suggestions, and is willing to make
          of none effect God’s holy law.</p>
      <p>We need to humble our hearts, and with sincerity and reverence search the Word of life; for that mind alone
          that is humble and contrite can see light. The heart, the mind, the soul, must be prepared to receive light.
          There must be silence in the soul. The thoughts must be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. The boastful
          <nobr>self-knowledge</nobr> and <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> must stand rebuked in the presence of the Word of
          God.</p>
      <p>The Lord speaks to the heart that humbles itself before Him. At the altar of prayer, as the throne of grace is
          touched by faith, we receive from the hand of God that celestial torch which enlightens our darkness, and
          convinces us of our spiritual necessity. The Holy Spirit takes of the things of God, and reveals them to the
          one who is sincerely seeking for the heavenly treasure. If we yield to His guidance, He leads us into all
          light. As we behold the glory of Christ, we become changed into His image. We have that faith which works by
          love, and puriﬁes the soul. Our hearts are renewed, and we are made willing to obey God in all
          <nobr>things.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 15, 1896.</p>
