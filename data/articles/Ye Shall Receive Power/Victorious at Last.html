      <p><strong>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live
          by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. Hebrews 10:37, 38.</strong></p>
      <p>Fellow pilgrim, we are still amid the shadows and turmoil of earthly activities; but soon our Saviour is to
          appear to bring deliverance and rest. Let us by faith behold the blessed hereafter, as pictured by the hand of
          God. He who died for the sins of the world, is opening wide the gates of Paradise to all who believe on Him.
          Soon the battle will have been fought, the victory won. Soon we shall see Him in whom our hopes of eternal
          life are centered. And in His presence the trials and sufferings of this life will seem as nothingness. The
          former things “shall not be remembered, nor come into mind” (Isaiah 65:17). “Cast not away therefore your
          conﬁdence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
          will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will
          not tarry” (Hebrews <nobr>10:35-37)....</nobr></p>
      <p>Look up, look up, and let your faith continually increase. Let this faith guide you along the narrow path that
          leads through the gates of the city into the great beyond, the wide, unbounded future of glory that is for the
          redeemed. “Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the
          precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye
          also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh” (James 5:7, 8).</p>
      <p>The nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of heaven. All will be a happy, united family,
          clothed with the garments of praise and thanksgiving. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and
          the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will unite in proclaiming, There shall be no more
          sin, neither shall there be any more <nobr>death.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 1, 1915.</p>
