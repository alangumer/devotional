    <h1>Fraternal Love Expressed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them
          that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. Acts
          4:32.</strong></p>
      <p>The record declares, “Neither was there any among them that lacked,” and it tells how the need was ﬁlled. Those
          among the believers who had money and possessions cheerfully sacriﬁced them to meet the emergency. Selling
          their houses or their lands, they brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet, “and distribution was
          made unto every man according as he had need” (Acts 4:34, 35).</p>
      <p>This liberality on the part of the believers was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit. The converts to
          the gospel were “of one heart and of one soul.” One common interest controlled <nobr>them—the</nobr> success
          of the mission entrusted to them; and covetousness had no place in their lives. Their love for their brethren
          and the cause they had espoused was greater than their love of money and possessions. Their works testiﬁed
          that they accounted the souls of men of higher value than earthly wealth.</p>
      <p>Thus it will ever be when the Spirit of God takes possession of the life. Those whose hearts are ﬁlled with the
          love of Christ will follow the example of Him who for our sake became poor, that through His poverty we might
          be made rich. Money, time, <nobr>inﬂuence—all</nobr> the gifts they have received from God’s hand, they will
          value only as a means of advancing the work of the gospel. Thus it was in the early church; and when in the
          church of today it is seen that by the power of the Spirit the members have taken their affections from the
          things of the world, and that they are willing to make sacriﬁces in order that their fellow men may hear the
          gospel, the truths proclaimed will have a powerful inﬂuence upon the <nobr>hearers.—The</nobr> Acts of the
          Apostles, 70, 71.</p>
