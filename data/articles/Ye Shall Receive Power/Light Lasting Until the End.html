    <h1>Light Lasting Until the End</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
          henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
          Revelation 14:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Abundant light has been given to our people in these last days. Whether or not my life is spared, my writings
          will constantly speak, and their work will go forward as long as time shall last. My writings are kept on ﬁle
          in the ofﬁce, and even though I should not live, these words that have been given to me by the Lord will still
          have life and will speak to the people. But my strength is yet spared, and I hope to continue to do much
          useful work. I may live until the coming of the Lord; but if I should not, I trust it may be said of me,
          “Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from
          their labours; and their works do follow them.” ...</p>
      <p>I thank God for the assurance of His love, and that I have daily His leading and guidance. I am very busy with
          my writing. Early and late, I am writing out the matters that the Lord opens before me. The burden of my work
          is to prepare a people to stand in the day of the Lord. The promise of Christ is sure. The time is not long.
          We must work and watch and wait for the Lord Jesus. We are called upon to be steadfast, unmovable, always
          abounding in the work of the Lord. All our hopes have their foundation in Christ.</p>
      <p>Are our people reviewing the past and the present and the future, as it is unfolding before the world? Are they
          heeding the messages of warning given them? Is it our greatest concern today that our lives shall be reﬁned
          and puriﬁed, and that we shall reﬂect the similitude of the divine? This must be the experience of all who
          join that company who are washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. They must be arrayed in the
          righteousness of Christ. His name must be written in their <nobr>foreheads.—Selected</nobr> Messages 1:55,
