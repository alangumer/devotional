    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth,
          which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me. John 15:26.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has condescended to give you an outpouring of His Holy Spirit. At the camp meetings, and in our
          various institutions, a great blessing has been showered upon you. You have been visited by the heavenly
          messengers of light and truth and power, and it should not be thought a strange thing that God should thus
          bless you. How does Christ subdue His chosen people to Himself? It is by the power of His Holy Spirit; for the
          Holy Spirit, through the Scriptures, speaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the hearts of men.</p>
      <p>Before His cruciﬁxion, Christ promised that the Comforter should be sent to His disciples. He said: “It is
          expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart,
          I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of
          judgment” (John 16:7, 8). “When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he
          shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to
          come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you” (verses 13, 14).</p>
      <p>This promise of Christ has been made little enough of, and because of a dearth of the Spirit of God, the
          spirituality of the law and its eternal obligations have not been comprehended. Those who have professed to
          love Christ have not comprehended the relation which exists between them and God, and it is still but dimly
          outlined to their understanding. They but vaguely comprehend the amazing grace of God in giving His only
          begotten Son for the salvation of the world. They do not understand how <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> are the
          claims of the holy law, how intimately the precepts of the law are to be brought into practical life. They do
          not realize what a great privilege and necessity are prayer, repentance, and the doing of the words of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>It is the ofﬁce of the Holy Spirit to reveal to the mind the character of the consecration that God will
          accept. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit, the soul is enlightened, and the character is renewed,
          sanctiﬁed, and <nobr>uplifted.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 30, 1894.</p>
