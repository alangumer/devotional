    <h1>Building Upon the Rock</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man,
          which built his house upon a rock. Matthew 7:24.</strong></p>
      <p>As you stand here today, and see the defects of your characters in the light of God’s great moral standard,
          will you not say, “I will redeem the past; I will go to work in the Lord’s vineyard”? By living faith will you
          not grasp the promises of God, and appropriate Christ’s righteousness, and ﬁnd the light of heaven shining in
          your life? You are to bring Christ into your every thought and action. A defective link in a chain makes it
          worthless, and a defect in your character will unﬁt you to enter the kingdom of heaven. You must set
          everything in order. But you cannot do this great work without divine aid. Are you ready to accept the
          promises of God, and to make them your own by living faith in his immutable word?</p>
      <p>You should walk by faith, not by feeling. We do not want a sensational religion; but we want a religion founded
          on intelligent faith. This faith plants its feet on the eternal rock of God’s Word. Those who walk by faith
          are all the time seeking for perfection of character by constant obedience to Christ. The Captain of our
          salvation has given us His orders, and we are to yield implicit obedience; but if we close the Book that
          reveals His will, and do not inquire, or search, or seek to understand, how can we fulﬁll its obligation? We
          shall be found wanting at last, if we pursue this course....</p>
      <p>We are coming to a crisis, and I am in terror for our souls. Why is it that we ﬁnd men leaving the faith? Are
          we in a position where we shall know what we believe, and shall not be shaken out? That souls leave the truth
          should not discourage us in the least, but only make us seek more earnestly for the blessing of God. It is not
          the education, or the talents, or the position of men, that is to save them. We are to be kept by the power of
          God through faith unto salvation.</p>
      <p>How do you stand before God today? The question is not How will you stand in the day of trouble, or at some
          future time? but how is it with your soul today? Will you go to work today? We want a personal, individual
          experience today. Today, we want Christ abiding with <nobr>us.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 9,
          1889.</p>
