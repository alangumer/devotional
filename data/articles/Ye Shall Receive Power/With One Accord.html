    <h1>With One Accord</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. Acts 2:1. To
          us today, as verily as to the ﬁrst disciples, the promise of the Spirit belongs. God will today endow men and
          women with power from above, as He endowed those who on the day of Pentecost heard the word of salvation. At
          this very hour His Spirit and His grace are for all who need them and will take Him at His word. Notice that
          it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity, when they were no longer striving for the highest
          place, that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had been put away. And the
          testimony borne of them after the Spirit had been given is the same. Mark the word: “The multitude of them
          that believed were of one heart and of one soul” (Acts 4:32). The Spirit of Him who died that
          sinners</strong></p>
      <p>might live animated the entire congregation of believers.</p>
      <p>The disciples did not ask for a blessing for themselves. They were weighted with the burden of souls. The
          gospel was to be carried to the ends of the earth, and they claimed the endowment of power that Christ had
          promised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit was poured out, and thousands were converted in a day.</p>
      <p>So it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension and give themselves to God for the saving of the lost.
          Let them ask in faith for the promised blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of
          the apostles was “the former rain,” and glorious was the result. But the latter rain will be more abundant.
          What is the promise to those living in these last days? “Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope:
          even today do I declare that I will render double unto thee” (Zechariah 9:12) “Ask ye of the Lord rain in the
          time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one
          grass in the ﬁeld” (Zechariah <nobr>10:1).—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 8:20, 21.</p>
