    <h1>Not Looking for Originality</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine. Titus 2:1.</strong></p>
      <p>We are in continual danger of getting above the simplicity of the gospel. There is an intense desire on the
          part of many to startle the world with something original, that shall lift the people into a state of
          spiritual ecstasy, and change the present order of experience. There is certainly great need of a change in
          the present order of experience; for the sacredness of present truth is not realized as it should be, but the
          change we need is a change of heart, and can only be obtained by seeking God individually for His blessing, by
          pleading with Him for His power, by fervently praying that His grace may come upon us, and that our characters
          may be transformed. This is the change we need today, and for the attainment of this experience we should
          exercise persevering energy and manifest heartfelt earnestness. We should ask with true sincerity, “What shall
          I do to be saved?” We should know just what steps we are taking heavenward.</p>
      <p>Christ gave to His disciples truths whose breadth and depth and value they little appreciated, or even
          comprehended, and the same condition exists among the people of God today. We too have failed to take in the
          greatness, to perceive the beauty of the truth which God has entrusted to us today. Should we advance in
          spiritual knowledge, we would see the truth developing and expanding in lines of which we have little dreamed,
          but it will never develop in any line that will lead us to imagine that we may know the times and the seasons
          which the Father hath put in His own power.</p>
      <p>Again and again have I been warned in regard to <nobr>time-setting.</nobr> There will never again be a message
          for the people of God that will be based on time. We are not to know the deﬁnite time either for the
          outpouring of the Holy Spirit or for the coming of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 22,
          1892.</p>
