    <h1>Advice for the Leaders</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Feed the ﬂock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
          willingly; not for ﬁlthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being
          ensamples to the ﬂock. 1 Peter 5:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>I am instructed to say to our ministering brethren, Let the messages that come from your lips be charged with
          the power of the Spirit of God. If ever there was a time when we needed the special guidance of the Holy
          Spirit, it is now. We need a thorough consecration. It is fully time that we gave to the world a demonstration
          of the power of God in our own lives and in our ministry.</p>
      <p>The Lord desires to see the work of proclaiming the third angel’s message carried forward with increasing
          efﬁciency. As He has worked in all ages to give victories to His people, so in this age He longs to carry to a
          triumphant fulﬁllment His purposes for His church. He bids His believing saints to advance unitedly, going
          from strength to greater strength, from faith to increased assurance and conﬁdence in the truth and
          righteousness of His cause.</p>
      <p>We are to stand ﬁrm as a rock to the principles of the Word of God, remembering that God is with us to give us
          strength to meet each new experience. Let us ever maintain in our lives the principles of righteousness, that
          we may go forward from strength to strength in the name of the Lord. We are to hold as very sacred the faith
          that has been substantiated by the instruction and approval of the Spirit of God from our earliest experience
          until the present time. We are to cherish as very precious the work that the Lord has been carrying forward
          through His <nobr>command-keeping</nobr> people, and which, through the power of His grace, will grow stronger
          and more efﬁcient as time advances.</p>
      <p>The enemy is seeking to becloud the discernment of God’s people, and to weaken their efﬁciency, but if they
          will labor as the Spirit of God shall direct, He will open doors of opportunity before them for the work of
          building up the old waste places. Their experience will be one of constant growth, until the Lord shall
          descend from heaven with power and great glory to set His seal of ﬁnal triumph upon His faithful
          <nobr>ones.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 12, 1913.</p>
