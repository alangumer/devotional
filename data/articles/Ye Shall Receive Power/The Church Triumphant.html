    <h1>The Church Triumphant</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all
          kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
          ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. Revelation 1:7,
          8.</strong></p>
      <p>God’s way is to make the day of small things the beginning of the triumph of truth and righteousness. For this
          reason none need be elated by a prosperous beginning, nor cast down by apparent feebleness. God is to His
          people riches, fullness, and power. His purposes for His chosen people are, like the eternal hills, ﬁrm and
          immovable.</p>
      <p>Remember that human might did not establish the church of God, neither can human might destroy it. From age to
          age the Holy Spirit is an overﬂowing fountain of life.... There is victory for all who strive</p>
      <p>lawfully, in perfect harmony with the law of God. They will triumph over all opposition. As they carry forward
          God’s work in the face of all foes, they will be given the guardianship of holy angels.</p>
      <p>Christ has pledged Himself to help all who join His army, to cooperate with Him in ﬁghting against visible and
          invisible foes. He has promised that they shall be joint heirs with Him to an immortal inheritance, that they
          shall reign as kings and priests before God. Those who are willing to share in this life the humiliation of
          the Saviour will share with Him in His glory. Those who choose to suffer afﬂiction with the people of God
          rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season will be given a place with Christ on His throne.</p>
      <p>Hold fast the Word of life. The tempest of opposition will spend itself by its own fury. The clamor will die
          away. Carry forward the Master’s work bravely and cheerfully. The Father above, who watches over His chosen
          ones with the tenderest solicitude, will bless the efforts made in His name. His work will never cease until
          its completion amid the triumphant shout, “Grace, grace unto <nobr>it.”—The</nobr> Signs of the Times,
          November 14, 1900.</p>
