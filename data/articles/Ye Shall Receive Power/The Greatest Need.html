      <p><strong>The Greatest Need</strong></p>
      <p>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Psalm 51:7. A revival of
          true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our ﬁrst
          work. There must be earnest effort to obtain the blessing of the Lord, not because God is not</p>
      <p>willing to bestow His blessing upon us, but because we are unprepared to receive it. Our heavenly Father is
          more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than are earthly parents to give good gifts to their
          children. But it is our work, by confession, humiliation, repentance, and earnest prayer, to fulﬁll the
          conditions upon which God has promised to grant us His blessing.</p>
      <p>A revival need be expected only in answer to prayer. While the people are so destitute of God’s Holy Spirit,
          they cannot appreciate the preaching of the Word; but when the Spirit’s power touches their hearts, then the
          discourses given will not be without effect. Guided by the teachings of God’s Word, with the manifestation of
          His Spirit, in the exercise of sound discretion, those who attend our meetings will gain a precious
          experience, and returning home will be prepared to exert a healthful inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>The old <nobr>standard-bearers</nobr> knew what it was to wrestle with God in prayer, and to enjoy the
          outpouring of His Spirit. But these are passing off from the stage of action; and who are coming up to ﬁll
          their places? How is it with the rising generation? Are they converted to God? Are we awake to the work that
          is going on in the heavenly sanctuary, or are we waiting for some compelling power to come upon the church
          before we shall arouse? Are we hoping to see the whole church revived? That time will never come.</p>
      <p>There are persons in the church who are not converted, and who will not unite in earnest, prevailing prayer. We
          must enter upon the work individually. We must pray more, and talk <nobr>less.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          March 22, 1887.</p>
