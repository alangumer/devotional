      <p><strong>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. Jeremiah 8:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord is coming. The earth’s history is soon to close. Are you prepared to meet the Judge of the earth? Bear
          in mind that “he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy” (James 2:13). How terrible it
          will be in the last great day to ﬁnd that those with whom we have been familiarly associated are separated
          from us forever; to see the members of our family, perhaps our own children, unsaved; to ﬁnd those who have
          visited our homes, and eaten at our tables, among the lost. Then we shall ask ourselves the question, Was it
          because of my impatience, my <nobr>un-Christlike</nobr> disposition; was it because self was not under
          control, that the religion of Christ became distasteful to them?</p>
      <p>The world must be warned of the soon coming of the Lord. We have but a little time in which to work. Years have
          passed into eternity that might have been improved in seeking ﬁrst the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
          and in diffusing the light to others. God calls upon His people who have great light, much labor bestowed upon
          them, and are established in the truth to now work for themselves and others as they have never done before.
          Make use of every ability; bring into exercise every power, every entrusted talent; use all the light that God
          has given you to do others good. Do not try to be preachers; but become ministers for God.</p>
      <p>As the truth is better understood by the workers, it will ever appear in a more striking light; as you seek to
          enlighten others, with your minds under the holy inﬂuence of the Spirit of God, your attention will be
          directed toward those things that are of eternal interest. In such efforts, mingled with prayers for divine
          light, your own hearts will throb with the quickening inﬂuence of the grace of God; your own affections will
          glow with more divine fervor, and your whole Christian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, and more
          prayerful. Thus by Christ abiding in the heart, you may become laborers together with <nobr>God.—The</nobr>
          Home Missionary, February 1, 1898.</p>
