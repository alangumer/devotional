    <h1>Witnesses for the Cross</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And ye are witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
          ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. Luke 24:48, 49.</strong></p>
      <p>After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the disciples, clothed with the divine panoply, went forth as
          witnesses to tell the wonderful story of the manger and the cross. They were humble men, but they went forth
          with the truth. After the death of their Lord, they were a helpless, disappointed, discouraged
          <nobr>company—as</nobr> sheep without a shepherd: but now they go forth as witnesses for the truth, with no
          weapons but the Word and Spirit of God, to triumph over all opposition. Their Saviour had been rejected and
          condemned and nailed to the ignominious cross. The Jewish priests and rulers had declared in scorn, “He saved
          others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
          believe him” (Matthew 27:42).</p>
      <p>But that cross, that instrument of shame and torture, brought hope and salvation to the world. The believers
          rallied; their hopelessness and conscious helplessness had left them. They were transformed in character, and
          united in the bonds of Christian love. Although without wealth, though counted by the world as mere ignorant
          ﬁshermen, they were made by the Holy Spirit witnesses for Christ. Without earthly honor or recognition, they
          were heroes of faith. From their lips came words of divine eloquence and power that shook the world.</p>
      <p>The third, fourth, and ﬁfth chapters of Acts give an account of their witnessing. Those who had rejected and
          cruciﬁed the Saviour expected to ﬁnd His disciples discouraged, crestfallen, and ready to disown their Lord.
          With amazement they heard the clear, bold testimony given under the power of the Holy Spirit. The words and
          works of the disciples represented the words and works of their Teacher; and all who heard them said, They
          have learned of Jesus, they talk as He talked. “And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
          resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all” (Acts <nobr>4:33).—;Ellen</nobr> G. White
