      <p><strong>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did
          eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And
          the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. Acts 2:46, 47.</strong></p>
      <p>Every truly converted soul will be intensely desirous to bring others from the darkness of error into the
          marvelous light of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. The great outpouring of the Spirit of God, which
          lightens the whole earth with His glory, will not come until we have an enlightened people, that know by
          experience what it means to be laborers together with God. When we have entire, <nobr>whole-hearted</nobr>
          consecration to the service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without
          measure; but this will not be while the largest portion of the church are not laborers together with God. God
          cannot pour out His Spirit when selﬁshness and <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> are so manifest; when a spirit
          prevails that, if put into words, would express that answer of <nobr>Cain—“Am</nobr> I my brother’s keeper?”
          (Genesis 4:9).</p>
      <p>If the truth for this time, if the signs that are thickening on every hand, that testify that the end of all
          things is at hand, are not sufﬁcient to arouse the sleeping energy of those who profess to know the truth,
          then darkness proportionate to the light which has been shining will overtake these souls. There is not the
          semblance of an excuse for their indifference that they will be able to present to God in the great day of
          ﬁnal reckoning. There will be no reason to offer as to why they did not live and walk and work in the light of
          the sacred truth of the Word of God, and thus reveal to a <nobr>sin-darkened</nobr> world, through their
          conduct, their sympathy, and their zeal, that the power and reality of the gospel could not be
          controverted.</p>
      <p>It is not the ministers alone, but the laymen, who are not contributing all that they can to persuade men, by
          precept and example, to accept the saving grace of Christ. With skill and tact, with wisdom received from
          above, they should persuade men to behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the
          <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 21, 1896.</p>
