    <h1>Each Victory Makes the Following Easier</h1>

      <p><strong>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. Romans 8:37. The work
          is before you to improve the remnant of your life in reforming and elevating the character. A</strong></p>
      <p>new life begins in the renewed soul. Christ is the indwelling Saviour. That which may be regarded as hard to
          give up must be yielded. The overbearing, dictatorial word must be left unspoken; then a precious victory will
          be gained.</p>
      <p>True happiness will be the result of every <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> every cruciﬁxion of self. One victory won,
          the next is more easily gained. Had Moses neglected the opportunities and privileges granted him of God, he
          would have neglected the light from heaven and would have been a disappointed, miserable man. Sin is from
          beneath; and when it is indulged, Satan is enshrined in the soul, there to kindle the very ﬁres of hell. God
          has not given His law to prevent the salvation of souls, but He wants all to be saved. Man has light and
          opportunities, and if he will improve them he may overcome. You may show by your life the power of the grace
          of God in overcoming.</p>
      <p>Satan is trying to set up his throne in the <nobr>soul-temple.</nobr> When he reigns he makes himself heard and
          felt in angry passions, in words of bitterness that grieve and wound; but as light has no communion with
          darkness, and Christ no union with Belial, the man must be wholly for one or the other. In yielding to
          <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> avarice, deception, fraud, or sin of any kind, he encourages the principles of
          Satan in his soul and closes the door of heaven to himself. Because of sin, Satan was thrust out of heaven;
          and no man indulging and fostering sin can go to heaven, for then Satan would again have a foothold
          there.</p>
      <p>When a man is earnestly engaged day by day in overcoming the defects in his character, he is cherishing Christ
          in his <nobr>soul-temple;</nobr> the light of Christ is in him. Under the bright beams of the light of
          Christ’s countenance his entire being becomes elevated and <nobr>ennobled.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church
          4:345, 346.</p>
