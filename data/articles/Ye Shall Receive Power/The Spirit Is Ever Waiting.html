    <h1>The Spirit Is Ever Waiting</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you
          all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John
          14:26.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is ever waiting to do His ofﬁce work upon the human heart. Those who desire to learn can place
          themselves in close connection with God, and the promise that the Comforter shall teach them all things, and
          bring all things to their remembrance, whatever Christ had said to His disciples when He was upon the earth
          will be fulﬁlled. But if we disconnect from God, we can be no longer students in the school of Christ. Then we
          shall feel no special burden for the souls for whom Christ has died.</p>
      <p>It was most difﬁcult for the disciples of Christ to keep His lessons distinct from the traditions and maxims of
          the rabbis, the scribes, and pharisees. The teachings which the disciples had been educated to respect as the
          voice of God held a power over their minds and molded their sentiments. The disciples could not be a living
          and shining light until they were freed from the inﬂuence of the sayings and commandments of men, and the
          words of Christ were deeply impressed upon their minds and hearts as distinct truths, as precious jewels, to
          be appreciated, loved, and acted upon.</p>
      <p>Jesus came to the world, lived a holy life, and died, to leave to the church His legacy in the valuable
          treasures He entrusted to them. He made His disciples the depositaries of most precious doctrines, to be
          placed in the hands of His church unmixed with the errors and traditions of men. He revealed Himself to them
          as the light of the world, the Sun of righteousness. And He promised them the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom
          the Father was to send in His <nobr>name.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, November 16, 1891.</p>
      <p>“I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you” (John 14:18). The divine Spirit that the world’s
          Redeemer promised to send is the presence and power of God. He will not leave His people in the world
          destitute of His grace, to be buffeted by the enemy of God, and harassed by the oppression of the world; but
          He will come to <nobr>them.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, November 23, 1891.</p>
