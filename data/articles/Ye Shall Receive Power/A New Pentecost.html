    <h1>A New Pentecost</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a
          great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. Acts 6:7.</strong></p>
      <p>As the disciples, ﬁlled with the power of the Spirit, went forth to proclaim the gospel, so God’s servants are
          to go forth today. Filled with an unselﬁsh desire to give the message of mercy to those who are in the
          darkness of error and unbelief, we are to take up the Lord’s work. He gives us our part to do in cooperation
          with Him, and He will also move on the hearts of unbelievers to carry forward His work in the regions beyond.
          Already many are receiving the Holy Spirit, and no longer will the way be blocked by listless
          indifference.</p>
      <p>Why has the history of the work of the disciples, as they labored with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the
          Holy Spirit, been recorded, if it is not that from this record the Lord’s people today are to gain an
          inspiration to work earnestly for Him? What the Lord did for His people in that time, it is just as essential,
          and more so, that He do for His people today. All that the apostles did, every church member today is to do.
          And we are to work with as much more fervor, to be accompanied by the Holy Spirit in as much greater measure,
          as the increase of wickedness demands a more decided call to repentance.</p>
      <p>Everyone on whom is shining the light of present truth is to be stirred with compassion for those who are in
          darkness. From all believers light is to be reﬂected in clear, distinct rays. A work similar to that which the
          Lord did through His delegated messengers after the day of Pentecost He is waiting to do today. At this time,
          when the end of all things is at hand, should not the zeal of the church exceed even that of the early church?
          Zeal for the glory of God moved the disciples to bear witness to the truth with mighty power. Should not this
          zeal ﬁre our hearts with a longing to tell the story of redeeming love, of Christ and Him cruciﬁed? Should not
          the power of God be even more mightily revealed today than in the time of the <nobr>apostles?—The</nobr>
