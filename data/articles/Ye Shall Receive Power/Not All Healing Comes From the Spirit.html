    <h1>Not All Healing Comes From the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have
          cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew
          you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Matthew 7:22, 23.</strong></p>
      <p>We need to be anchored in Christ, rooted and grounded in the faith. Satan works through agents. He selects
          those who have not been drinking of the living waters, whose souls are athirst for something new and strange,
          and who are ever ready to drink at any fountain that may present itself. Voices will be heard, saying, “Lo,
          here is Christ,” or “Lo, ... there”; but we must believe them not” (Matthew 24:23). We have unmistakable
          evidence of the voice of the True Shepherd, and He is calling upon us to follow Him. He says, “I have kept my
          Father’s commandments” (John 15:10). He leads His sheep in the path of humble obedience to the law of God, but
          He never encourages them in the transgression of that law.</p>
      <p>“The voice of a stranger” is the voice of one who neither respects nor obeys God’s holy, just, and good law.
          Many make great pretensions to holiness, and boast of the wonders they perform in healing the sick, when they
          do not regard this great standard of righteousness. But through whose power are these cures wrought?</p>
      <p>If those through whom cures are performed are disposed, on account of these manifestations, to excuse their
          neglect of the law of God, and continue in disobedience, though they have power to any and every extent, it
          does not follow that they have the great power of God. On the contrary, it is the <nobr>miracle-working</nobr>
          power of the great deceiver. He is a transgressor of the moral law, and employs every device that he can
          master to blind men to its true character. We are warned that in the last days he will work with signs and
          lying wonders. And he will continue these wonders until the close of probation, that he may point to them as
          evidence that he is an angel of light and not of <nobr>darkness.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 17,
          1885.</p>
