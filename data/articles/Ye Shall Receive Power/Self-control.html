      <p><strong>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not deﬁle himself with the portion of the king’s meat,
          nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not deﬁle
          himself. Daniel 1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>The lesson here presented is one that we would do well to ponder. A strict compliance with the Bible
          requirements will be a blessing both to body and soul. The fruit of the Spirit is not only love, joy, and
          peace, but temperance also. We are enjoined not to deﬁle our bodies; for they are the temples of the Holy
          Spirit.</p>
      <p>The Hebrew captives were men of like passions with ourselves. Amid the seductive inﬂuences of the luxurious
          courts of Babylon, they stood ﬁrm. The youth of today are surrounded with allurements to
          <nobr>self-indulgence.</nobr> Especially in our large cities, every form of sensual gratiﬁcation is made easy
          and inviting. Those who, like Daniel, refuse to deﬁle themselves will reap the reward of temperate habits.
          With their greater physical stamina and increased power of endurance, they have a bank of deposit upon which
          to draw in case of emergency.</p>
      <p>Right physical habits promote mental superiority. Intellectual power, physical stamina, and length of life
          depend upon immutable laws. Nature’s God will not interfere to preserve men from the consequences of violating
          nature’s requirements. He who strives for the mastery must be temperate in all things. Daniel’s clearness of
          mind and ﬁrmness of purpose, his power in acquiring knowledge and in resisting temptation, were due in a great
          degree to the plainness of his diet, in connection with his life of prayer....</p>
      <p>The history of Daniel and his youthful companions has been recorded on the pages of the Inspired Word, for the
          beneﬁt of the youth of all succeeding ages. Through the record of their ﬁdelity to the principles of
          temperance, God is speaking today to young men and young women, bidding them gather up the precious rays of
          light He has given on the subject of Christian temperance, and place themselves in right relation to the laws
          of <nobr>health.—The</nobr> Youth’s Instructor, July 9, 1903.</p>
