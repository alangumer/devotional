    <h1>Brotherly Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another. Romans
          12:10.</strong></p>
      <p>When the Holy Spirit moves upon human minds, all petty complaints and accusations between man and his fellow
          man will be put away. The bright beams of the Sun of righteousness will shine into the chambers of the mind
          and heart. In our worship of God there will be no distinction between rich and poor, white and black. All
          prejudice will be melted away. When we approach God, it will be as one brotherhood. We are pilgrims and
          strangers, bound for a better country, even a heavenly. There all pride, all accusation, all
          <nobr>self-deception,</nobr> will forever have an end. Every mask will be laid aside, and we shall “see him as
          he is” (1 John 3:2). There our songs will catch the inspiring theme, and praise and thanksgiving will go up to
          <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 24, 1899.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus came to our world to save men and women of all nationalities.... Jesus came to shed</p>
      <p>light over the whole world. At the beginning of His ministry He declared His mission: “The Spirit of the Lord
          is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
          brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty
          them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord” (Luke 4:18, 19)....</p>
      <p>The Lord’s eye is upon all His creatures; He loves them all, and makes no difference between white and black,
          except that He has a special tender pity for those who are called to bear a greater burden than others. Those
          who love God and believe on Christ as their Redeemer, while they must meet the trials and the difﬁculties that
          lie in their path, should yet with a cheerful spirit accept their life as it is, considering that God above
          regards these things, and for all that the world neglects to bestow, He will Himself make up to them in the
          best of <nobr>favors.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:487, 488.</p>
