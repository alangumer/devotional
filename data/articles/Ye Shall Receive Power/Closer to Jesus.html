    <h1>Closer to Jesus</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will ﬂee from you. Draw nigh to God, and
          he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. James 4:7,
          8.</strong></p>
      <p>When temptation comes upon us, we need spiritual discernment, that we may detect Satan’s agency, and draw close
          to Jesus. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Resist the devil, and he will ﬂee from you. Every
          moment it is necessary to ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith; for doubt must be resisted, and faith must be
          encouraged. In temptation, inclination must be overruled by reason. Self will clamor for indulgence, but
          inclination must be resisted, and temptation overcome.</p>
      <p>The Lord has given warnings, He has presented principles that it is necessary for every Christian to heed, and
          bring into his practical life. Those who pass on in indifference to the light and warning which God has been
          pleased to give will grow more and more egotistical and <nobr>self-sufﬁcient.</nobr> Those who do not place
          their dependence upon God will certainly be overthrown by the enemy. Satan is working by every conceivable
          device to keep in his own ranks those who claim to be on the Lord’s side. He can blind their eyes until they
          will call light darkness, and darkness light....</p>
      <p>Though the light of God is shining in more distinct rays than ever before, and will shine more and more clearly
          as we near the close of earth’s history, those who will be able to discern truth from error will be men who
          are often upon their knees, seeking wisdom from God. The bright beams of the Sun of righteousness can alone
          reveal the numerous and varied plottings of the enemy. The wicked one is at work with all deceivableness of
          unrighteousness; and while we are not to keep our eyes upon the powers of darkness, we cannot be ignorant of
          their devices.</p>
      <p>But our faith must center in Jesus Christ. Looking unto Him, clinging to His strength as sufﬁcient for every
          emergency, our heart joins His heart, our life is knit by hidden links to His life, and because He lives, we
          shall live also. This is practical religion; for we are to be kept by the power of God through faith unto
          salvation. No one of us can be safe save as we join the Lord in a perpetual covenant, that shall not be
          forgotten by <nobr>us.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 14, 1893.</p>
