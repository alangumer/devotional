    <h1>Searching for Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of
          me. John 5:39.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ came in the form of humanity to live the law of God. He was the Word of life. He came to be the gospel
          of salvation to the world, and to fulﬁll every speciﬁcation of the law. Jesus is the word, the guidebook,
          which must be received and obeyed in every particular. How necessary that this mine of truth be explored, and
          the precious treasures of truth be discovered and secured as rich jewels. The incarnation of Christ, His
          divinity, His atonement, His wonderful life in heaven as our advocate, the ofﬁce of the Holy
          <nobr>Spirit—all</nobr> these living, vital themes of Christianity are revealed from Genesis to Revelation.
          The golden links of truth form a chain of evangelical truth, and the ﬁrst, and staple, is found in the great
          teachings of Christ Jesus. Why, then, should not the Scriptures be ennobled and exalted in every school in our
          land? How little children are educated to study the Bible as the Word of God, and feed upon its truths, which
          are the ﬂesh and blood of the Son of God!</p>
      <p>“Except ye eat the ﬂesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my ﬂesh,
          and drinketh my blood [that is, continues to receive the words of Christ and practice them], hath eternal
          life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my ﬂesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He
          that eateth my ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him” (John <nobr>6:53-56),</nobr> “and he
          that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
          Spirit which he hath given us” (1 John 3:24).</p>
      <p>There is necessity for every family to make the Bible the book of their study. Christ’s sayings are pure gold,
          without one particle of dross, unless men, with their human understanding, shall try to put it there, and make
          falsehood appear as a portion of truth. To those who have received the false interpretation of the Word, when
          they search the Scriptures with the determined effort to obtain the very marrow of truth contained in them,
          the Holy Spirit opens the eyes of their understanding, and the truths of the Word are to them as a new
          <nobr>revelation.—Fundamentals</nobr> of Christian Education, 385, 386.</p>
