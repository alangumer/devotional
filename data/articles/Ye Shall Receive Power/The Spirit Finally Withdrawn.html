    <h1>The Spirit Finally Withdrawn</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is ﬁlthy, let him be ﬁlthy still: and he that
          is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. Revelation
          22:11.</strong></p>
      <p>When the third angel’s message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The
          people of God have accomplished their work. They have received “the latter rain,” “the refreshing from the
          presence of the Lord” (Acts 3:19), and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening
          to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done; the ﬁnal test has
          been brought upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received
          “the seal of the living God” (Revelation 7:2).</p>
      <p>Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and with a loud voice says, “It
          is done,” and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as He makes the solemn announcement: “He that is
          unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is ﬁlthy, let him be ﬁlthy still: and he that is righteous, let
          him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still” (Revelation 22:11). Every case has been
          decided for life or death. Christ has made the atonement for His people and blotted out their sins. The number
          of His subjects is made up; “the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole
          heaven” (Daniel 7:27), is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to reign as King of kings
          and Lord of lords.</p>
      <p>When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous
          must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint which has been upon the wicked is
          removed, and Satan has entire control of the ﬁnally impenitent. God’s longsuffering has ended. The world has
          rejected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed the boundary of their
          probation; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at last <nobr>withdrawn.—The</nobr> Great
          Controversy, 613, 614.</p>
