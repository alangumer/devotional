    <h1>To Be God’s Instrumentalities</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every
          man? 1 Corinthians 3:5.</strong></p>
      <p>God’s servants do not all possess the same gifts, but they are all His workmen. Each is to learn of the Great
          Teacher, and then to communicate what he has learned. All do not do the same work, but under the sanctifying
          inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit they are all God’s instrumentalities. God employs a diversity of gifts in His work
          of winning souls from Satan’s army.</p>
      <p>“Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his
          own labor” (1 Corinthians 3:8). God, and not man, is the judge of man’s work, and He will apportion to each
          his just reward. It is not given to any human being to judge between the different servants of God. The Lord
          alone is the judge and rewarder of every good work.</p>
      <p>“He that planteth and he that watereth are one,” engaged in the same <nobr>work—the</nobr> salvation of souls.
          “We are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building” (verse 9). In these words
          the church is compared to a cultivated ﬁeld, in which the husbandmen are to labor, caring for the vines of the
          Lord’s planting; and to a building, which is to become a holy temple for the Lord. Christ is the Master
          Workman. All are to work under His supervision, letting Him work for and through His workmen. He gives them
          tact and skill, and if they heed His instructions, crowns their labor with success.</p>
      <p>None are to complain against God, who has appointed to each man his work. He who murmurs and frets, who wants
          his own way, who desires to mold his fellow laborers to suit his own ideas, needs the divine touch before he
          is qualiﬁed to labor in any line. Unless he is changed, he will surely mar the work.</p>
      <p>Remember that we are laborers together with God. God is the <nobr>all-powerful,</nobr> effectual mover. His
          servants are His <nobr>instruments.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 11, 1900.</p>
