    <h1>In Unexpected Ways</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? Acts 2:12. We
          are to pray for the impartation of the Spirit as the remedy for <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> souls. The church needs
          to be converted, and why should we not prostrate ourselves at the throne of grace, as representatives of the
          church, and from a broken heart and contrite spirit make earnest supplication that the Holy Spirit shall be
          poured out upon us from on high? Let us pray that when it shall be graciously bestowed, our cold hearts may be
          revived,</strong></p>
      <p>and we may have discernment to understand that it is from God, and receive it with joy.</p>
      <p>Some have treated the Spirit as an unwelcome guest, refusing to receive the rich gift, refusing to acknowledge
          it, turning from it, and condemning it as fanaticism. When the Holy Spirit works the human agent, it does not
          ask us in what way it shall operate. Often it moves in unexpected ways. Christ did not come as the Jews
          expected. He did not come in a manner to glorify them as a nation. His forerunner came to prepare the way for
          Him by calling upon the people to repent of their sins and be converted, and be baptized. Christ’s message was
          “The kingdom of heaven is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel” (Mark 1:15).</p>
      <p>The Jews refused to receive Christ, because He did not come in accordance with their expectations. The ideas of
          ﬁnite men were held as infallible, because hoary with age. This is the danger to which the church is now
          <nobr>exposed—that</nobr> the inventions of ﬁnite men shall mark out the precise way for the Holy Spirit to
          come. Though they would not care to acknowledge it, some have already done this. And because the Spirit is to
          come, not to praise men or to build up their erroneous theories, but to reprove the world of sin, and of
          righteousness, and of judgment, many turn away from Him.... The Holy Spirit ﬂatters no man, neither does
          it</p>
      <p>work according to the devising of any man.</p>
      <p>Finite, sinful men are not to work the Holy Spirit. When it shall come as a reprover, through any human agent
          whom God shall choose, it is man’s place to hear and obey its <nobr>voice.—The</nobr> Ellen G. White 1888
          Materials, 1540, 1541.</p>
