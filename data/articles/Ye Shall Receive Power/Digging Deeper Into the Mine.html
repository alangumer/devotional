    <h1>Digging Deeper Into the Mine</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of
          mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. Acts 17:11.</strong></p>
      <p>It is proper and right to read the Bible; but your duty does not end there; for you are to search its pages for
          yourselves. The knowledge of God is not to be gained without mental effort, without prayer for wisdom in order
          that you may separate from the pure grain of truth the chaff with which men and Satan have misrepresented the
          doctrines of truth. Satan and his confederacy of human agents have endeavored to mix the chaff of error with
          the wheat of truth. We should diligently seek for the hidden treasure, and seek wisdom from heaven in order to
          separate human inventions from the divine commands. The Holy Spirit will aid the seeker for great and precious
          truths which relate to the plan of redemption.</p>
      <p>I would impress upon all the fact that a casual reading of Scriptures is not enough. We must search, and this
          means the doing of all the Word implies. As the miner eagerly explores the earth to discover its veins of
          gold, so you are to explore the Word of God for the hidden treasure that Satan has so long sought to hide from
          man. The Lord says, “If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching” (John 7:17, RV).</p>
      <p>The Word of God is truth and light, and is to be a lamp unto your feet, to guide you every step of the way to
          the gates of the city of God. It is for this reason that Satan has made such desperate efforts to obstruct the
          path that has been cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. You are not to take your ideas to the
          Bible, and make your opinions a center around which truth is to revolve. You are to lay aside your ideas at
          the door of investigation, and with humble, subdued hearts, with self hid in Christ, with earnest prayer, you
          are to seek wisdom from God. You should feel that you must know the revealed will of God, because it concerns
          your personal, eternal welfare. The Bible is a directory by which you may know the way to eternal life. You
          should desire above all things that you may know the will and ways of the <nobr>Lord.—Fundamentals</nobr> of
