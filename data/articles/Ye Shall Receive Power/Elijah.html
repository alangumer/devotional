      <p><strong>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be
          God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word. 1 Kings
          18:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Among the mountains of Gilead, east of the Jordan, there dwelt in the days of Ahab a man of faith and prayer
          whose fearless ministry was destined to check the rapid spread of apostasy in Israel. Far removed from any
          city of renown, and occupying no high station in life, Elijah the Tishbite nevertheless entered upon his
          mission conﬁdent in God’s purpose to prepare the way before him and to give him abundant success. The word of
          faith and power was upon his lips, and his whole life was devoted to the work of reform. His was the voice of
          one crying in the wilderness to rebuke sin and press back the tide of evil. And while he came to the people as
          a reprover of sin, his message offered the balm of Gilead to the <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> souls of all who
          desired to be healed.</p>
      <p>As Elijah saw Israel going deeper and deeper into idolatry, his soul was distressed and his indignation
          aroused. God had done great things for His people. He had delivered them from bondage and given them “the
          lands of the heathen: ... that they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws” (Psalm 105:44, 45). But the
          beneﬁcent designs of Jehovah were now <nobr>well-nigh</nobr> forgotten. Unbelief was fast separating the
          chosen nation from the Source of their strength.</p>
      <p>Viewing this apostasy from his mountain retreat, Elijah was overwhelmed with sorrow. In anguish of soul he
          besought God to arrest the <nobr>once-favored</nobr> people in their wicked course, to visit them with
          judgments, if need be, that they might be led to see in its true light their departure from Heaven. He longed
          to see them brought to repentance before they should go to such lengths in <nobr>evil-doing</nobr> as to
          provoke the Lord to destroy them <nobr>utterly.—Prophets</nobr> and Kings, 119, 120.</p>
