      <p><strong>But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
          Proverbs 4:18.</strong></p>
      <p>At inﬁnite cost, provision has been made that men shall reach the perfection of Christian character. Those who
          have been privileged to hear the truth, and have been impressed by the Holy Spirit to receive the Holy
          Scriptures as the voice of God, have no excuse for becoming dwarfs in the religious life. By exercising the
          ability which God has given, they are to be daily learning, and daily receiving spiritual fervor and power,
          which have been provided for every true believer. If we would be growing plants in the Lord’s garden, we must
          have a constant supply of spiritual life and earnestness. Growth will then be seen in the faith and knowledge
          of our Lord Jesus Christ. There is no halfway house where we may throw off responsibility, and rest by the
          way. We are to keep advancing heavenward, developing a solid religious character.</p>
      <p>The measure of the Holy Spirit we receive will be proportioned to the measure of our desire and the faith
          exercised for it, and the use we shall make of the light and knowledge that shall be given to us. We shall be
          entrusted with the Holy Spirit according to our capacity to receive and our ability to impart it to others.
          Christ says, “Every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh ﬁndeth” (Luke 11:10).</p>
      <p>He who truly seeks for the precious grace of Christ will be sure not to be disappointed. This promise has been
          given to us by Him who will not deceive us. It is not stated as a maxim or a theory, but as a fact, as a law
          of the divine government. We can be assured that we shall receive the Holy Spirit if we individually try the
          experiment of testing God’s Word. God is true; His order is perfect. “He that seeketh ﬁndeth; and to him that
          knocketh it shall be opened” (verse 10). Light and truth will shine forth according to the desire of the soul.
