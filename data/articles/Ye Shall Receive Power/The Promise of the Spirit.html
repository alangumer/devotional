      <p><strong>The Promise of the Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever. John
          14:16.</p>
      <p>When Christ gave His disciples the promise of the Spirit, He was nearing the close of His earthly ministry. He
          was standing in the shadow of the cross, with a full realization of the load of guilt that was to rest upon
          Him as the Sin Bearer. Before offering Himself as the sacriﬁcial victim, He instructed His disciples regarding
          a most essential and complete gift which He was to bestow upon His <nobr>followers—the</nobr> gift that would
          bring within their reach the boundless resources of His grace.</p>
      <p>“I will pray the Father,” He said, “and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for
          ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him:
          but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you” (John 14:16, 17). The Saviour was pointing
          forward to the time when the Holy Spirit should come to do a mighty work as His representative. The evil that
          had been accumulating for centuries was to be resisted by the divine power of the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race. Christ declared that the divine
          inﬂuence of His Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost to the present
          time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To
          all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctiﬁer, guide,
          and witness. The more closely believers have walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they
          testiﬁed of their Redeemer’s love and of His saving grace. The men and women who through long centuries of
          persecution and trial enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives have stood as signs
          and wonders in the world. Before angels and men they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming
          <nobr>love.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>47-49.</nobr></p>
