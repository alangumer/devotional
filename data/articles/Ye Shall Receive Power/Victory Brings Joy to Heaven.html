    <h1>Victory Brings Joy to Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
          ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. Luke 15:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Satanic agencies are always warring for the mastery over the human mind, but the angels of God are constantly
          at work, strengthening the weak hands and conﬁrming the feeble knees of all who call upon God for help. The
          promise to every child of God is, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall
          be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh ﬁndeth; and to him that knocketh
          it shall be opened” (Matthew 7:8)....</p>
      <p>The Lord has had <nobr>true-hearted</nobr> men and women, those who have made a covenant with Him by sacriﬁce.
          They have not swerved from their integrity. They have kept themselves unspotted from the world, and they have
          been led by the Light of life to defeat the purposes of the wily foe. Will human beings now act their part in
          resisting the devil? If they will do this, he will surely ﬂee from them. Angels, who will do for you what you
          cannot do for yourselves, are waiting for your cooperation. They are waiting for you to respond to the drawing
          of Christ. Draw nigh to God and to one another. By desire, by silent prayer, by resistance of satanic
          agencies, put your will on the side of God’s will. While you have one desire to resist the devil, and
          sincerely pray, Deliver me from temptation, you will have strength for your day.</p>
      <p>It is the work of the heavenly angels to come close to the tried, the tempted, the suffering ones. They labor
          long and untiringly to save the souls for whom Christ has died. And when souls appreciate their advantages,
          appreciate the heavenly assistance sent them, respond to the Holy Spirit’s working on their behalf; when they
          put their will on the side of Christ’s will, angels bear the tidings heavenward. Returning to the heavenly
          courts, they report their success with the souls for whom they have ministered, and there is rejoicing among
          the heavenly <nobr>host.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 4, 1899.</p>
