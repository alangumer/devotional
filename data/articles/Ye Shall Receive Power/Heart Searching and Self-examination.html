      <p><strong>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way
          in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. Psalm 139:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>After Christ’s ascension, the disciples were gathered together in one place to make humble supplication to God.
          And after ten days of heart searching and <nobr>self-examination,</nobr> the way was prepared for the Holy
          Spirit to enter the cleansed, consecrated soul temples. Every heart was ﬁlled with the Spirit, as though God
          desired to show His people that it was His prerogative to bless them with the choicest of heaven’s
          blessings.</p>
      <p>What was the <nobr>result?—Thousands</nobr> were converted in a day. The sword of the Spirit ﬂashed right and
          left. Newly edged with power, it pierced even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints
          and marrow. The idolatry that had been mingled with the worship of the people was overthrown. New territory
          was added to the kingdom of God. Places that had been barren and desolate sounded forth His praises.
          Believers, reconverted, born again, were a living power for God. A new song was put in their mouths, even
          praise to the Most High.</p>
      <p>Controlled by the Spirit, they saw Christ in their brethren. One interest prevailed. One subject of emulation
          swallowed up all <nobr>others—to</nobr> be like Christ, to do the works of Christ. The earnest zeal felt was
          expressed by loving helpfulness, by kindly words and unselﬁsh deeds. All strove to see who could do the most
          for the enlargement of Christ’s kingdom. “The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
          soul” (Acts 4:32).</p>
      <p>In the twelve disciples the leaven of truth was hidden by the Great Teacher. These disciples were to be the
          instruments in God’s hands for revealing truth to the world. Divine power was given them; for a risen Saviour
          breathed on them, saying, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” Imbued with this Spirit, they went forth to witness for
          the truth. And so God desires His servants to go forth today with the message He has given them. But till they
          receive the Holy Spirit, they cannot bear this message with power. Till they receive the Spirit, they cannot
          realize what God can do through <nobr>them.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 10, 1902.</p>
