    <h1>Accepting the Spirit’s Inﬂuence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all ﬁlthiness of the
          ﬂesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. 2 Corinthians 7:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord sends us warning, counsel, and reproof, that we may have opportunity to correct our errors before they
          become second nature. But if we refuse to be corrected, God does not interfere to counteract the tendencies of
          our own course of action. He works no miracle that the seed sown may not spring up and bear fruit. That man
          who manifests an inﬁdel hardihood or a stolid indifference to divine truth is but reaping the harvest which he
          has himself sown. Such has been the experience of many. They listen with stoical indifference to the truths
          which once stirred their very souls. They sowed neglect, indifference, and resistance to the truth; and such
          is the harvest which they reap.</p>
      <p>The coldness of ice, the hardness of iron, the impenetrable, unimpressible nature of <nobr>rock—all</nobr>
          these ﬁnd a counterpart in the character of many a professed Christian. It was thus that the Lord hardened the
          heart of Pharaoh. God spoke to the Egyptian king by the mouth of Moses, giving him the most striking evidences
          of divine power; but the monarch stubbornly refused the light which would have brought him to repentance. God
          did not send a supernatural power to harden the heart of the rebellious king, but as Pharaoh resisted the
          truth, the Holy Spirit was withdrawn, and he was left to the darkness and unbelief which he had chosen.</p>
      <p>By persistent rejection of the Spirit’s inﬂuence, men cut themselves off from God. He has in reserve no more
          potent agency to enlighten their minds. No revelation of His will can reach them in their unbelief.</p>
      <p>Would that I could lead every professed follower of Christ to see this matter as it is. We are all sowing
          either to the ﬂesh or to the Spirit, and we reap the harvest from the seed we sow. In choosing our pleasures
          or employments, we should seek only those things that are excellent. The triﬂing, the worldly, the debasing,
          should have no power to control the affections or the <nobr>will.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 20,
          1882.</p>
