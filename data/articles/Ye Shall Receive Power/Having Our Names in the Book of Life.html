    <h1>Having Our Names in the Book of Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of
          the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. Revelation
          3:5.</strong></p>
      <p>The expression “he that overcometh” indicates that there is something for every one of us to overcome. The
          overcomer is to be clothed in the white raiment of Christ’s righteousness, and of Him it is written: “I will
          not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his
          angels.” Oh, what a privilege it is to be an overcomer, and to have our names presented before the Father by
          the Saviour Himself! And when, as overcomers, we shall be “clothed in white raiment,” the Lord will
          acknowledge our faithfulness as verily as in the days of the early Christian church. He acknowledged the “few
          names even in Sardis” who had “not deﬁled their garments” (Revelation 3:4); and we shall walk with Him in
          white, for through His atoning sacriﬁce we shall be accounted worthy.</p>
      <p>My dear friends, in view of these encouraging promises, how earnestly should we strive to perfect a character
          that will enable us to stand before the Son of God! Only those who are clothed in the garments of His
          righteousness will be able to endure the glory of His presence when He shall appear with “power and great
          glory.”</p>
      <p>It means much to be an overcomer. The besetments of the enemy and all his evil agencies must be ﬁrmly resisted.
          Every moment we must be on guard. Not for one instant are we to lose sight of Christ, and of His power to save
          in the hour of trial. Our hand must be placed in His, that we may be upheld by the power of His might....</p>
      <p>The True Witness declares: “Behold, I have set before thee an open door” (verse 8). Let us thank God with heart
          and soul and voice; and let us learn to approach unto Him as through an open door, believing that we may come
          freely with our petitions, and that He will hear and answer. It is by a living faith in His power to help,
          that we shall receive strength to ﬁght the battles of the Lord with the conﬁdent assurance of
          <nobr>victory.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 9, 1908.</p>
