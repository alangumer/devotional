    <h1>A Clear Voice Amid Other Voices</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to
          the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. Isaiah 30:21.</strong></p>
      <p>Amid the confusion of delusive doctrines, the Spirit of God will be a guide and a shield to those who have not
          resisted the evidences of truth. He silences every other voice than that which comes from Him who is the truth
          and the life. God gives to every soul opportunity to hear the voice of the True Shepherd, to receive the
          knowledge of God and our Saviour. When the heart receives this truth as a precious treasure, Christ is formed
          within, the hope of glory, while the whole heavenly universe exclaims, Amen and amen! We have absolute need of
          the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit. We have no time to confer with ﬂesh and blood.</p>
      <p>We have need of divine illumination. Every individual is striving to become a center of inﬂuence; and until God
          works for His people, they will not see that subordination to God is the only safety for any soul. His
          transforming grace upon human hearts will lead to unity that has not yet been realized; for all who are
          assimilated to Christ will be in harmony with one another. The Holy Spirit will create unity.</p>
      <p>“He shall glorify me” (John 16:14). “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and
          Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3). The Holy Spirit gloriﬁes God by so revealing His character to
          His people that He becomes the object of their supreme affections, and by making manifest His character in
          them.</p>
      <p>They see clearly that there never was any righteousness in the world but His, no excellence in the world but
          that derived from Him. When the Spirit was poured out from on high, the church was ﬂooded with light, but
          Christ was the source of that light; His name was on every tongue, His love ﬁlled every heart. So it will be
          when the angel that comes down from heaven having great power shall lighten the whole earth with His
          glory....</p>
      <p>The gift of His Holy Spirit, rich, full, and abundant, is to His church as an encompassing wall of ﬁre, and the
          powers of hell shall not prevail against it. In their untainted purity and spotless perfection Christ looks
          upon His people as the reward of all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love, and the supplement of His
          <nobr>glory—Christ</nobr> the great center from which radiates all <nobr>glory.—The</nobr> Home Missionary,
          November 1, 1893.</p>
