    <h1>Divine Help in Doing Samaritan Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on
          him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and
          brought him to an inn, and took care of him. Luke 10:33, 34.</strong></p>
      <p>I have been shown that the medical missionary work will discover, in the very depths of degradation, men who
          once possessed ﬁne minds, richest qualiﬁcations, who will be rescued, by proper labor, from their fallen
          condition. It is the truth as it is in Jesus that is to be brought before human minds after they have been
          sympathetically cared for and their physical necessities met. The Holy Spirit is working and cooperating with
          the human agencies that are laboring for such souls, and some will appreciate the foundation upon a rock for
          their religious faith.</p>
      <p>There is to be no startling communication of strange doctrine to these subjects whom God loves and pities; but
          as they are helped physically by the medical missionary workers, the Holy Spirit cooperates with the minister
          of human agencies to arouse the moral powers. The mental powers are awakened into activity, and these poor
          souls will, many of them, be saved in the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>Nothing can, or ever will, give character to the work in the presentation of truth to help the people just
          where they are so well as Samaritan work. A work properly conducted to save poor sinners that have been passed
          by the churches will be the entering wedge whereby the truth will ﬁnd standing room. A different order of
          things needs to be established among us as a people, and as this class of work is done, there will be created
          an entirely different atmosphere surrounding the souls of the workers; for the Holy Spirit communicates to all
          those who are doing God’s service, and those who are worked by the Holy Spirit will be a power for God in
          lifting up, strengthening, and saving the souls that are ready to <nobr>perish.—Welfare</nobr> Ministry, 131,
