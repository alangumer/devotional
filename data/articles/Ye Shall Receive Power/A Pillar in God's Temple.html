    <h1>A Pillar in God’s Temple</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I
          will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which
          cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. Revelation 3:12.</strong></p>
      <p>It may seem wonderful to us that Christ should reveal Himself to John as He is, strange that He should thus
          address Himself to the churches. But we should remember that the church, enfeebled and defective though it is,
          is the object of Christ’s supreme regard. Constantly He watches over it with tender solicitude, and
          strengthens it by His Holy Spirit. Will we, as members of His church, allow Him to impress our minds and to
          work through us to His glory? Will we heed the messages He addresses to the church? Let us determine to be
          among the number who shall meet Him with joy at His coming, and not among those who “shall wail because of
          him” (Revelation 1:7). Let us make certain our redemption by obeying the messages that He gives to His
          church.</p>
      <p>Christ bears to the church the words of consolation: “Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also
          will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon
          the earth. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. Him that
          overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon
          him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of
          heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name” (Revelation <nobr>3:10-12).</nobr></p>
      <p>Let us strive to obtain an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord. Let us diligently study the gospel
          that Christ came in person to present to John on the Isle of <nobr>Patmos—the</nobr> gospel that is termed
          “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly
          come to pass” (Revelation 1:1). Let us remember always that “blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear
          the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand” (verse
          <nobr>3).—Signs</nobr> of the Times, February 4, 1903.</p>
