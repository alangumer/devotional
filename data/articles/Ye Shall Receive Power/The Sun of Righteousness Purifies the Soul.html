    <h1>The Sun of Righteousness Puriﬁes the Soul</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
          in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his
          dear Son. Colossians 1:12, 13.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the privilege of every earnest seeker for truth and righteousness to rely upon the sure promises of God.
          The Lord Jesus makes manifest the fact that the treasures of divine grace are placed entirely at our disposal,
          in order that we may become channels of light. We cannot receive the riches of the grace of Christ without
          desiring to impart them to others. When we have the love of Christ in our hearts, we shall feel that it is our
          duty and privilege to communicate it. The sun shining in the heavens, pours its bright beams into all the
          highways and byways of life. It has sufﬁcient light for thousands of worlds like ours. And so it is with the
          Sun of righteousness; His bright beams of healing and gladness are amply sufﬁcient to save our little world,
          and are efﬁcacious in establishing security in every world that has been created....</p>
      <p>Those who realize their need of repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ, will have
          contrition of soul, will repent for their resistance of the Spirit of the Lord. They will confess their sin in
          refusing the light that heaven has so graciously sent them, and they will forsake the sin that grieved and
          insulted the Spirit of the Lord. They will humble self, and accept the power and grace of Christ,
          acknowledging the messages of warning, reproof, and encouragement. Then their faith in the work of God will be
          made manifest, and they will rely upon the atoning sacriﬁce. They will make a personal appropriation of
          Christ’s abundant grace and righteousness, and He will become to them a present Saviour; for they will realize
          their need of Him, and with complete trust will rest in Him. They will drink of the water of life from the
          divine, inexhaustible Fountain. In a new and blessed experience, they will cast themselves upon Christ, and
          become partakers of the divine <nobr>nature.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August 26, 1890.</p>
