    <h1>God’s Work Characterized by Calmness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let all things be done decently and in order. 1 Corinthians 14:40.</strong></p>
      <p>I ... met a man and his wife who claim to follow the Word of God and to believe the Testimonies. They have had
          an unusual experience during the past two or three years. They seemed to be honesthearted people....</p>
      <p>I told this brother and his wife that the experience through which I passed in my youth, shortly after the
          passing of the time in 1844, had led me to be very, very cautious about accepting anything similar to that
          which we then met and rebuked in the name of the Lord.</p>
      <p>No greater harm could be done to the work of God at this time than for us to allow a spirit of fanaticism to
          come into our churches, accompanied by strange workings which are incorrectly supposed to be operations of the
          Spirit of God.</p>
      <p>As this brother and his wife outlined their experiences, which they claim have come to them as the result of
          receiving the Holy Ghost with apostolic power, it seemed to be a facsimile of that which we were called to
          meet and correct in our early experience.</p>
      <p>Toward the close of our interview Brother L proposed that we unite in prayer, with the thought that possibly
          while in prayer his wife would be exercised as they had described to me, and that then I might be able to
          discern whether this was of the Lord or not. To this I could not consent, because I have been instructed that
          when one offers to exhibit these peculiar manifestations, this is a decided evidence that it is not the work
          of God.</p>
      <p>We must not permit these experiences to lead us to feel discouraged. Such experiences will come to us from time
          to time. Let us give no place to strange exercisings, which really take the mind away from the deep movings of
          the Holy Spirit. God’s work is ever characterized by calmness and dignity. We cannot afford to sanction
          anything that would bring in confusion and weaken our zeal in regard to the great work that God has given us
          to do in the world to prepare for the second coming of <nobr>Christ.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:41, 42.</p>
