    <h1>Moving Among the Students</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from
          the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. Romans 8:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord God of heaven has caused His Holy Spirit from time to time to move upon the students in the school
          [Battle Creek College], that they might acknowledge Him in all their ways, so that He might direct their
          paths. At times the manifestation of the Holy Spirit has been so decided that studies were forgotten, and the
          greatest Teacher the world ever knew made His voice heard, saying, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
          heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
          heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew
          <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr></p>
      <p>The Lord knocked at the door of hearts, and I saw that angels of God were present. There seemed to be no
          special effort on the part of the teachers to inﬂuence the students to give their attention to the things of
          God, but God had a Watcher in the school, and though His presence was unseen, yet His inﬂuence was
          discernible. Again and again there have been manifest tokens of the presence of the holy Watchman in the
          school. Again and again the voice of Jesus has spoken to the students, saying, “Behold, I stand at the door,
          and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
          with me” (Revelation 3:20).</p>
      <p>The Lord has been waiting long to impart the greatest, truest joys to the heart. All those who look to Him with
          undivided hearts, He will greatly bless. Those who have thus looked to Him have caught more distinct views of
          Jesus as their <nobr>sin-bearer,</nobr> their <nobr>all-sufﬁcient</nobr> sacriﬁce, and have been hid in the
          cleft of the rock, to behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world. When we have a sense of
          His <nobr>all-sufﬁcient</nobr> sacriﬁce, our lips are tuned to the highest, loftiest themes of
          <nobr>praise.—Special</nobr> Testimonies On Education, 77, 78.</p>
