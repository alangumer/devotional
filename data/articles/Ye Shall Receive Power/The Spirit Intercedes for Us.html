    <h1>The Spirit Intercedes for Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession
          for the saints according to the will of God. Romans 8:27.</strong></p>
      <p>We have only one channel of approach to God. Our prayers can come to Him through one name
          <nobr>only—that</nobr> of the Lord Jesus our Advocate. His Spirit must inspire our petitions. No strange ﬁre
          was to be used in the censers that were waved before God in the sanctuary. So the Lord Himself must kindle in
          our hearts the burning desire, if our prayers are acceptable to Him. The Holy Spirit within must make
          intercessions for us, with groanings that cannot be uttered.</p>
      <p>A deep sense of our need, and a great desire for the things for which we ask, must characterize our prayers,
          else they will not be heard. But we are not to become weary, and cease our petitions because the answer is not
          immediately received. “The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force” (Matthew
          11:12). The violence here meant is a holy earnestness, such as Jacob manifested. We need not try to work
          ourselves up into an intense feeling; but calmly, persistently, we are to press our petitions at the throne of
          grace. Our work is to humble our souls before God, confessing our sins, and in faith drawing nigh unto God.
          The Lord answered the prayer of Daniel, not that Daniel might glorify himself, but that the blessing might
          reﬂect glory to God. It is the design of God to reveal Himself in His providence and in His grace. The object
          of our prayers must be the glory of God, not the gloriﬁcation of ourselves.</p>
      <p>When we see ourselves weak, ignorant, and helpless, as we really are, we shall come before God as humble
          suppliants. It is ignorance of God and of Christ that makes any soul proud and <nobr>self-righteous.</nobr>
          The infallible indication that a man knows not God is found in the fact that he feels that in himself he is
          great or good. Pride of heart is always associated with ignorance of God. It is the light from God that
          discovers our darkness and destitution. When the divine glory was revealed to Daniel, he exclaimed, “My
          comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength” (Daniel 10:8).</p>
      <p>The moment the humble seeker sees God as He is, that moment he will have the same view of himself that Daniel
          had. There will be no lifting up of the soul unto vanity, but a deep sense of the holiness of God and of the
          justice of His <nobr>requirements.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 9, 1897.</p>
