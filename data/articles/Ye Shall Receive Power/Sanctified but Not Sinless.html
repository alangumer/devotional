    <h1>Sanctiﬁed but Not Sinless</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
          sanctiﬁcation, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
          1 Corinthians 1:30, 31.</strong></p>
      <p>Just here we might distinguish between genuine and false sanctiﬁcation. Sanctiﬁcation does not consist in
          merely professing and teaching the Word of God, but in living in conformity to His will. Those who claim to be
          sinless, and make their boast of sanctiﬁcation, are <nobr>self-conﬁdent,</nobr> and do not realize their
          peril. They anchor their souls upon the supposition that having once experienced the sanctifying power of God,
          they are in no danger of falling. While claiming to be rich and increased in goods, and in need of nothing,
          they know not that they are miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</p>
      <p>But those who are truly sanctiﬁed have a sense of their own weakness. Feeling their need, they will go for
          light and grace and strength to Jesus, in whom all fullness dwells, and who alone can supply their wants.
          Conscious of their own imperfections, they seek to become more like Christ, and to live in accordance with the
          principles of His holy law. This continual sense of inefﬁciency will lead to such entire dependence upon God
          that His Spirit will be exempliﬁed in them. The treasures of heaven will be opened to supply the wants of
          every hungering, thirsting soul. All of this character have the assurance of one day beholding the glory of
          that kingdom which as yet the imagination can only faintly grasp.</p>
      <p>Those who have felt the sanctifying and transforming power of God must not fall into the dangerous error of
          thinking that they are sinless, that they have reached the highest state of perfection, and are beyond the
          reach of temptation. The standard the Christian is to keep before him is the purity and loveliness of Christ’s
          character. Day by day he may be putting on new beauties, and reﬂecting to the world more and still more of the
          divine <nobr>image.—The</nobr> Bible Echo, February 21, 1898.</p>
