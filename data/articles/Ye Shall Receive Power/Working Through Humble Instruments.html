    <h1>Working Through Humble Instruments</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 1
          Corinthians 1:25.</strong></p>
      <p>God will move upon men of humble position in society, men who have not become insensible to the bright rays of
          light through so long contemplating the light of truth, and refusing to make any improvement or advancement
          therein. Many such will be seen hurrying hither and thither, constrained by the Spirit of God to bring the
          light to others. The truth, the word of God, is as a ﬁre in their bones, ﬁlling them with a burning desire to
          enlighten those who sit in darkness.</p>
      <p>Many, even among the uneducated, now proclaim the words of the Lord. Children are impelled by the Spirit to go
          forth and declare the message from heaven. The Spirit is poured out upon all who will yield to its promptings,
          and, casting off all man’s machinery, his binding rules and cautious methods, they will declare the truth with
          the might of the Spirit’s power. Multitudes will receive the faith and join the armies of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Many of those who are professedly followers of the Lord at the present time do not submit themselves to the
          guidance of His Spirit, but try to harness up the Holy Spirit, and drive Him in their way. All such must
          abandon their <nobr>self-sufﬁciency,</nobr> and yield themselves unreservedly to the Lord, that He may work
          out His good pleasure in and through them.</p>
      <p>The seven last plagues are about to descend upon the disobedient. Many have let the gospel invitation go
          unheeded; they have been tested and tried; but mountainous obstacles have seemed to loom up before their
          faces, blocking their onward march. Through faith, perseverance, and courage, many will surmount these
          obstructions and walk out into the glorious light. Almost unconsciously barriers have been erected in the
          strait and narrow way; stones of stumbling have been placed in the path; these will all be rolled away. The
          safeguards which false shepherds have thrown around their ﬂocks will become as naught; thousands will step out
          into the light, and work to spread the <nobr>light.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 23, 1895.</p>
