    <h1>The Mind Renewed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may
          prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. Romans 12:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The part man has to act in the salvation of the soul is to believe on Jesus Christ as a perfect Redeemer, not
          for some other man, but for his own self. He is to trust, to love, to fear the God of heaven. There is a
          certain work to be accomplished. Man must be delivered from the power of sin. He must be made perfect in every
          good work. In doing the words of Christ is his only assurance that his house is built upon the solid
          foundation. To hear, to say, to preach, and not to do the words of Christ is building upon the sand.</p>
      <p>Those who do the words of Christ will perfect a Christian character, because Christ’s will is their will. Thus
          is Christ formed within, the hope of glory. They are beholding, as in a glass, the glory of God. By our making
          Christ the subject of meditation, He will become the subject of conversation; and by beholding, we will
          actually be changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord. Man, fallen man,
          may be transformed by the renewing of the mind, so that he can “prove what is that good, and acceptable, and
          perfect, will of God.” How does he prove this? By the Holy Spirit taking possession of his mind, spirit,
          heart, and character. Where does the proving come in? “We are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels,
          and to men” (1 Corinthians 4:9).</p>
      <p>A real work is wrought by the Holy Spirit upon the human character, and its fruits are seen; just as a good
          tree will bear good fruit, so will the tree that is actually planted in the Lord’s garden produce good fruit
          unto eternal life. Besetting sins are overcome; evil thoughts are not allowed in the mind; evil habits are
          purged from the soul temple. The tendencies, which have been biased in a wrong direction, are turned in a
          right direction. Wrong dispositions and feelings are rooted out. Holy tempers and sanctiﬁed emotions are now
          the fruit borne upon the Christian tree. An entire transformation has taken place. This is the work to be
          <nobr>wrought.—Elder</nobr> E. P. Daniels and the Fresno Church, 8, 9.</p>
