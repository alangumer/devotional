      <p><strong>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning ﬁery furnace, and he will
          deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy
          gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Daniel 3:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>While these youth were working out their own salvation, God was working in them to will and to do of His good
          pleasure. Here are revealed the conditions of success. To make God’s grace our own, we must act our part. The
          Lord does not propose to perform for us either the willing or the doing. His grace is given to work in us to
          will and to do, but never as a substitute for our effort. Our souls are to be aroused to cooperate. The Holy
          Spirit works in us, that we may work out our own salvation. This is the practical lesson the Holy Spirit is
          striving to teach us. “It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure”
          (Philippians 2:13).</p>
      <p>The Lord will cooperate with all who earnestly strive to be faithful in His service, as He cooperated with
          Daniel and his three companions. Fine mental qualities and a high tone of moral character are not the result
          of accident. God gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of them. The openings of Providence
          must be quickly discerned and eagerly entered. There are many who might become mighty men, if, like Daniel,
          they would depend upon God for grace to be overcomers, and for strength and efﬁciency to do their work.</p>
      <p>I address you, young men: Be faithful. Put heart into your work. Imitate none who are slothful, and who give
          divided service. Actions, often repeated, form habits, habits form character. Patiently perform the little
          duties of life. So long as you undervalue the importance of faithfulness in the little duties, your
          <nobr>character-building</nobr> will be unsatisfactory. In the sight of Omnipotence, every duty is important.
          The Lord has said, “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much” (Luke 16:10). In the
          life of a true Christian there are no <nobr>nonessentials.—Messages</nobr> to Young People, 147, 148.</p>
