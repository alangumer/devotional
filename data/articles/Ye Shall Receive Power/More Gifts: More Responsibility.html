    <h1>More Gifts: More Responsibility</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and
          delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave ﬁve talents, to another two, and to another one; to every
          man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. Matthew 25:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>To every man is given his work. One man may not be able to do the work for which another man has been trained
          and educated. But the work of every man must begin at the heart, not resting in a theory of the truth. The
          work of him who surrenders the soul to God and cooperates with divine agencies will reveal an able, wise
          workman, who discerns how to adapt himself to the situation. The root must be holy, or there will be no holy
          fruit. All are to be workers together with God. Self must not become prominent. The Lord has entrusted talents
          and capabilities to every individual, and those who are most highly favored with opportunities and privileges
          to hear the Spirit’s voice are under the heaviest responsibility to God.</p>
      <p>Those who are represented as having but one talent have also their work to do. By trading, not with pounds, but
          with pence, they are diligently to employ their ability, determined not to fail nor be discouraged. They are
          to ask in faith, and depend upon the Holy Spirit to work upon unbelieving hearts. If they depend upon their
          own capabilities, they will fail. Those who faithfully trade upon the one talent will hear the gracious
          commendations spoken to them with as much heartiness as to those who have been gifted with many talents, and
          who have wisely improved them, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few
          things, I will make thee ruler over many things” (Matthew 25:21).</p>
      <p>It is the spirit of humility in which the work is done which God regards. He who had but one talent had an
          inﬂuence to exert, and his work was needed. In perfecting his own character, in learning in the school of
          Christ, he was exerting an inﬂuence that helped to perfect the character of those who had larger
          responsibilities, who were in danger of building themselves up, and of neglecting some important little
          things, which that faithful man with his one talent was regarding with diligent <nobr>care.—Notebook</nobr>
