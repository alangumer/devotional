    <h1>Removing Every Hindrance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing,
          and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the
          same judgment. 1 Corinthians 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>For the outpouring of the Spirit every lover of the cause of truth should pray. And as far as lies in our
          power, we are to remove every hindrance to His working. The Spirit can never be poured out while variance and
          bitterness toward one another are cherished by the members of the church. Envy, jealousy, evil surmising, and
          <nobr>evil-speaking</nobr> are of Satan, and they effectually bar the way against the Holy Spirit’s
          working.</p>
      <p>Nothing else in this world is so dear to God as His church. Nothing is guarded by Him with such jealous care.
          Nothing so offends God as an act that injures the inﬂuence of those who are doing His service. He will call to
          account all who aid Satan in his work of criticizing and discouraging.</p>
      <p>Those who are destitute of sympathy, tenderness, and love cannot do Christ’s work. Before the prophecy can be
          fulﬁlled, The weak shall be “as David,” and the house of David “as the angel of the Lord” (Zechariah 12:8),
          the children of God must put away every thought of suspicion in regard to their brethren. Heart must beat in
          unison with heart. Christian benevolence and brotherly love must be far more abundantly shown. The words are
          ringing in my ears: “Draw together, draw together.” The solemn, sacred truth for this time is to unify the
          people of God. The desire for preeminence must die. One subject of emulation must swallow up all
          <nobr>others—who</nobr> will most nearly resemble Christ in character? Who will most entirely hide self in
          Jesus?</p>
      <p>“Herein is my Father gloriﬁed,” Christ says, “that ye bear much fruit” (John 15:8). If there was ever a place
          where the believers should bear much fruit, it is at our camp meetings. At these meetings our acts, our words,
          our spirit, are marked, and our inﬂuence is as <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> as <nobr>eternity.—Testimonies</nobr>
          for the Church 6:42.</p>
