    <h1>God Can Use Common Skills</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri,
          the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and he hath ﬁlled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
          understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship. Exodus 35:30, 31.</strong></p>
      <p>Skill in the common arts is a gift from God. He provides both the gift and wisdom to use the gift aright. When
          He desired a work done on the tabernacle, He said, “See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
          son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I have ﬁlled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
          understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:2, 3). Through the prophet
          Isaiah the Lord said, “Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. Doth the plowman plow all
          day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?</p>
      <p>“When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the ﬁtches, and scatter the cumin, and cast
          in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place? For his God doth instruct him to
          discretion, and doth teach him. For the ﬁtches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart
          wheel turned about upon the cumin; but the ﬁtches are beaten out with a staff, and the cumin with a rod. Bread
          corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise
          it with his horsemen. This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and
          excellent in working” (Isaiah <nobr>28:23-29).</nobr></p>
      <p>God dispenses His gifts as it pleases Him. He bestows one gift upon one, and another gift upon another, but all
          for the good of the whole body. It is in God’s order that some shall be of service in one line of work, and
          others in other <nobr>lines—all</nobr> working under the selfsame Spirit. The recognition of this plan will be
          a safeguard against emulation, pride, envy, or contempt of one another. It will strengthen unity and mutual
          <nobr>love.—Counsels</nobr> to Parents and Teachers, 314, 315.</p>
