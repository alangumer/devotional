    <h1>A Thorough Reformation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Fulﬁl ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
          Philippians 2:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The time has come for a thorough reformation to take place. When this reformation begins, the spirit of prayer
          will actuate every believer and will banish from the church the spirit of discord and strife. Those who have
          not been living in Christian fellowship will draw close to one another. One member working in right lines will
          lead other members to unite with him in making intercession for the revelation of the Holy Spirit. There will
          be no confusion, because all will be in harmony with the mind of the Spirit. The barriers separating believer
          from believer will be broken down, and God’s servants will speak the same things. The Lord will cooperate with
          His servants. All will pray understandingly the prayer that Christ taught His servants: “Thy kingdom come. Thy
          will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).</p>
      <p>As I hear of the terrible calamities that from week to week are taking place, I ask myself: What do these
          things mean? The most awful disasters are following one another in quick succession. How frequently we hear of
          earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by ﬁre and ﬂood, with great loss of life and property! Apparently
          these calamities are capricious outbreaks of seemingly disorganized, unregulated forces, but in them God’s
          purpose may be read. They are one of the means by which He seeks to arouse men and women to a sense of their
          danger.</p>
      <p>The coming of Christ is nearer than when we ﬁrst believed. The great controversy is nearing its end. The
          judgments of God are in the land. They speak in solemn warning, saying: “Be ye also ready: for in such an hour
          as ye think not the Son of man cometh” (Matthew <nobr>24:44).—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 8:251,
          252.</p>
