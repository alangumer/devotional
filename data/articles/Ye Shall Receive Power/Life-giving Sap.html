      <p><strong>And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts
          came to Ephesus: and ﬁnding certain disciples, he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
          believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. Acts 19:1,
          2.</strong></p>
      <p>There are today many as ignorant of the Holy Spirit’s work upon the heart as were those believers in Ephesus;
          yet no truth is more clearly taught in the Word of God. Prophets and apostles have dwelt upon this theme.
          Christ Himself calls our attention to the growth of the vegetable world as an illustration of the agency of
          His Spirit in sustaining spiritual life. The sap of the vine, ascending from the root, is diffused to the
          branches, sustaining growth and producing blossoms and fruit. So the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of the
          Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Saviour, pervades the soul, renews the motives and affections, and brings
          even the thoughts into obedience to the will of God, enabling the receiver to bear the precious fruit of holy
          deeds.</p>
      <p>The Author of this spiritual life is unseen, and the exact method by which that life is imparted and sustained,
          it is beyond the power of human philosophy to explain. Yet the operations of the Spirit are always in harmony
          with the written Word. As in the natural, so in the spiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by
          moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed
          within our reach. So the spiritual life is sustained by use of those means that Providence has supplied. If
          the follower of Christ would grow up “unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
          Christ” (Ephesians 4:13), he must eat of the bread of life and drink of the water of salvation. He must watch
          and pray and work, in all things giving heed to the instructions of God in His <nobr>Word.—The</nobr> Acts of
          the Apostles, 284, 285.</p>
