    <h1>The Historian: Using Secular Sources</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most
          surely believed among us, even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and
          ministers of the word; it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very
          ﬁrst, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus. Luke <nobr>1:1-3.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>As the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of His Word, and the scenes of the past and the
          future, I have been bidden to make known to others that which has thus been <nobr>revealed—to</nobr> trace the
          history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a light on the
          <nobr>fast-approaching</nobr> struggle of the future. In pursuance of this purpose, I have endeavored to
          select and group together events in the history of the church in such a manner as to trace the unfolding of
          the great testing truths that at different periods have been given to the world, that have excited the wrath
          of Satan, and the enmity of a <nobr>world-loving</nobr> church, and that have been maintained by the witness
          of those who “loved not their lives unto the death” (Revelation 12:11)....</p>
      <p>The great events which have marked the progress of reform in past ages are matters of history, well known and
          universally acknowledged by the Protestant world; they are facts which none can gainsay. This history I have
          presented brieﬂy, in accordance with the scope of the book, and the brevity which must necessarily be
          observed, the facts having been condensed into as little space as seemed consistent with a proper
          understanding of their application.</p>
      <p>In some cases where a historian has so grouped together events as to afford, in brief, a comprehensive view of
          the subject, or has summarized details in a convenient manner, his words have been quoted; but in some
          instances no speciﬁc credit has been given, since the quotations are not given for the purpose of citing that
          writer as authority, but because his statement affords a ready and forcible presentation of the subject.</p>
      <p>In narrating the experience and views of those carrying forward the work of reform in our time, similar use has
          been made of their published <nobr>works.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, xi, xii.</p>
