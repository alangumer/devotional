      <p><strong>Beauty in Diversity</strong></p>
      <p>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.... Now there are diversities</p>
      <p>of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are
          diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 1 Corinthians
          <nobr>12:1-6.</nobr></p>
      <p>The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the
          Holy Spirit. “To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
          Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another
          the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
          tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
          dividing to every man severally as he will” (1 Corinthians <nobr>12:8-11)....</nobr></p>
      <p>In all the Lord’s arrangements, there is nothing more beautiful than His plan of giving to men and women a
          diversity of gifts. The church is His garden, adorned with a variety of trees, plants, and ﬂowers. He does not
          expect the hyssop to assume the proportions of the cedar, nor the olive to reach the height of the stately
          palm. Many have received but a limited religious and intellectual training, but God has a work for this class
          to do, if they will labor in humility, trusting in Him....</p>
      <p>Different gifts are imparted to different ones, that the workers may feel their need of one another. God
          bestows these gifts, and they are employed in His service, not to glorify the possessor, not to uplift man,
          but to uplift the world’s Redeemer. They are to be used for the good of all mankind, by representing the
          truth, not testifying to a falsehood.... In every word and act, kindness and love will be revealed; and as
          each worker</p>
      <p>ﬁlls his appointed place faithfully, the prayer of Christ for the unity of His followers will be answered, and
          the world will know that these are His <nobr>disciples.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, March 15, 1910.</p>
