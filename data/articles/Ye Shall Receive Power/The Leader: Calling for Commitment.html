    <h1>The Leader: Calling for Commitment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the
          gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the ﬂood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose
          land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Joshua 24:15.</strong></p>
      <p>I feel a special interest in the movements and decisions that shall be made at this conference [the 1901
          General Conference session] regarding the things that should have been done years ago, and especially ten
          years ago, when we were assembled in conference, and the Spirit and power of God came into our meeting,
          testifying that God was ready to work for this people if they would come into working order....</p>
      <p>The light then given me was that this people should stand higher than any other people on the face of the whole
          earth, that they should be a loyal people, a people who would rightly represent truth. The sanctifying power
          of the truth, revealed in their lives, was to distinguish them from the world. They were to stand in moral
          dignity, having such a close connection with heaven that the Lord God of Israel could give them a place in the
          earth.</p>
      <p>Year after year the same acknowledgment was made, but the principles which exalt a people were not woven into
          the work. God gave them clear light as to what they should do, and what they should not do, but they departed
          from that light, and it is a marvel to me that we stand in as much prosperity as we do today. It is because of
          the great mercy of our God, not because of our righteousness, but that His name should not be dishonored in
          the world....</p>
      <p>The Word of God is to be our guide. Have you given heed to the Word? The Testimonies are not by any means to
          take the place of the Word. They are to bring you to that neglected Word, that you may eat the words of
          Christ, that you may feed upon them, that by living faith you may be built up from that upon which you feed.
          If you live in obedience to Christ and His Word, you are eating the leaves of the tree of life, which are for
          the healing of the <nobr>nations.—The</nobr> General Conference Bulletin, April 3, 1901.</p>
