      <p><strong>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; but have renounced the
          hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by
          manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 2 Corinthians
          4:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>My brother, there is danger of those in our ranks making a mistake in regard to receiving the Holy Ghost. Many
          suppose an emotion or a rapture of feeling to be an evidence of the presence of the Holy Spirit. There is
          danger that right sentiments will not be understood, and that Christ’s words “Teaching them to observe all
          things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:20) will lose their signiﬁcance. There is danger that
          original devisings and superstitious imaginings will take the place of the Scriptures. Tell our people, Be not
          anxious to bring in something not revealed in the Word. Keep close to Christ. Remember His words: “Teaching
          them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
          the world” (verse 20).</p>
      <p>He is with us as we teach the words He spoke in the Old Testament as well as in the New. He who gave
          commandment in the New Testament is the One also who gave the instruction contained in the Old Testament. The
          Old and New Testaments are both sacred; for they both contain the words of Christ. All communication from
          heaven to earth since Adam’s fall has come through Christ. He who believes the instruction contained in the
          New Testament and in the Old, doing those things which Christ has commanded therein, has the Saviour always
          with <nobr>him.—The</nobr> Kress Collection, 126.</p>
      <p>The apostles and prophets and holy men of old did not perfect their characters by miracles, by some wonderful
          and unusual demonstration; but they used the ability given them by God, trusting alone in the righteousness of
          Christ. And all who will use the same means may secure the same <nobr>result.—The</nobr> General Conference
          Bulletin, July 1, 1900.</p>
      <p>Satan is willing that every transgressor of God’s law shall claim to be holy. This is what he himself is doing.
          He is satisﬁed when men rest their faith on spurious doctrines and religious enthusiasm; for he can use such
          persons to good purpose in deceiving <nobr>souls.—Evangelism,</nobr> 597.</p>
