    <h1>Generosity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>How that in a great trial of afﬂiction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto
          the riches of their liberality. 2 Corinthians 8:2.</strong></p>
      <p>It is only when Christian motives are fully acknowledged, and the conscience is awake to duty, when divine
          light makes impressions upon the heart and character, that selﬁshness is overcome, and the mind of Christ is
          exempliﬁed. The Holy Spirit, working upon human hearts and characters, will expel all tendency to
          covetousness, to deceptive dealing.</p>
      <p>When the Lord’s messenger bears a message to the church, God is speaking to the people, awakening the
          conscience to see that they have not been rendering an honest tithe to the Lord, and that when it was not
          convenient to give, they have failed to present their offerings to Him. They have used the Lord’s own money
          for themselves, in building houses, in purchasing horses, carriages, or lands. They do this in the hope of
          large returns, and every year they have the same excuse. “Will a man rob God?” (Malachi 3:8). Oh, yes, he has
          done this many times, because he has not been spiritual, to discern the spiritual things.</p>
      <p>On some occasions the Lord has moved decidedly upon worldly, selﬁsh men. Their minds were illuminated by the
          Holy Spirit, their hearts felt its softening, subduing inﬂuence. Under a sense of the abundant mercy and grace
          of God, they felt it their duty to promote His cause, to build up His kingdom. They remembered the
          requirement, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where
          thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
          doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal” (Matthew 6:19, 20). They felt a desire to have
          a share in the kingdom of God, and they pledged to give of their means to some of the various enterprises of
          the Lord’s cause. That pledge was not made to man, but to God in the presence of His angels, who were moving
          upon the hearts of these selﬁsh, <nobr>money-loving</nobr><nobr>men.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 23,
          1893.</p>
