    <h1>To Avoid Doctrinal Errors</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also
          according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of
          these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable
          wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 2 Peter 3:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord will certainly do great things for us if we will hunger and thirst after righteousness. We are the
          purchased property of Jesus Christ. We must not lose our devotion, our consecration. We are in conﬂict with
          the errors and delusions that have to be swept away from the minds of those who have not acted upon the light
          they already have. Bible truth is our only safety.</p>
      <p>I know and understand that we are to be established in the faith, in the light of the truth given us in our
          early experience. At that time one error after another pressed in upon us, and ministers and doctors brought
          in new doctrines. We would search the Scriptures with much prayer and the Holy Spirit would bring the truth to
          our minds. Sometimes whole nights would be devoted to searching the Scriptures and earnestly asking God for
          guidance. Companies of earnest, devoted men and women assembled for this purpose. The power of God would come
          upon me and I was enabled clearly to deﬁne what is truth and what is error.</p>
      <p>As the points of our faith were thus established, our feet were placed upon a solid foundation. We accepted the
          truth point by point under the demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I would be taken off in vision and
          explanations would be given me. I was given illustrations of heavenly things and of the sanctuary, so that we
          were placed where light was shining on us in clear, distinct rays.</p>
      <p>All these truths are immortalized in my writings. The Lord never denies His Word. Men may get up scheme after
          scheme, and the enemy will seek to seduce souls from the truth, but all who believe that the Lord has spoken
          through Sister White, and has given her a message, will be safe from the many delusions that will come in
          these last <nobr>days.—Manuscript</nobr> Release 760:22, 23.</p>
