    <h1>The Eyewitness: Inspired to Give Testimony</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and
          truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 1 John 1:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The work begun in feebleness and obscurity has continued to increase and strengthen. Publishing houses and
          missions in many lands attest its growth. In place of the edition of our ﬁrst paper carried to the post ofﬁce
          in a carpetbag, many hundreds of thousands of copies of our various periodicals are now sent out monthly from
          the ofﬁces of publication. The hand of God has been with His work to prosper and build it up.</p>
      <p>The later history of my life would involve the history of many of the enterprises which have arisen among us,
          and with which my lifework has been closely intermingled. For the upbuilding of these institutions, my husband
          and [I] labored with pen and voice. To notice, even brieﬂy, the experiences of these active and busy years
          would far exceed the limits of this sketch. Satan’s efforts to hinder the work and to destroy the workmen have
          not ceased; but God has had a care for His servants and for His work.</p>
      <p>In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of advance to our present standing, I can say,
          Praise God! As I see what the Lord has wrought, I am ﬁlled with astonishment, and with conﬁdence in Christ as
          leader. We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His
          teaching in our past history.</p>
      <p>We are debtors to God to use every advantage He has entrusted to us to beautify the truth by holiness of
          character, and to send the messages of warning, and of comfort, of hope and love, to those who are in the
          darkness of error and <nobr>sin.—Life</nobr> Sketches, 195, 196.</p>
