    <h1>In Moments of Despair</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for
          every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh ﬁndeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
          Matthew 7:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>Then come, and seek, and ﬁnd. The reservoir of power is open, is full and free. Come with humble hearts, not
          thinking that you must do some good thing to merit the favor of God, or that you must make yourself better
          before you can come to Christ. You can never do anything to better your condition. In the name of Jesus, come
          with full assurance of faith, because you are a sinner; for Christ said, “I am not come to call the righteous,
          but sinners to repentance” (Matthew 9:13). Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. You are to ask, to
          seek, to knock, and to believe that you are accepted through Christ Jesus, trusting Him alone to do those
          things for you which you can never do for yourself....</p>
      <p>Jesus is our atoning sacriﬁce; we can make no atonement for ourselves, but by faith we can accept the atonement
          that has been made. “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring
          us to God” (1 Peter 3:18). “Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, ... but with the precious blood of
          Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot” (1 Peter 1:18, 19). “The blood of Jesus Christ his Son
          cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). It is by virtue of this precious blood that the
          <nobr>sin-stricken</nobr> soul can be restored to soundness. While you are putting up your petition to God,
          the Holy Spirit applies the faithful promises of God to your heart.</p>
      <p>In moments of perplexity, when Satan suggests doubt and discouragement, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up as
          a standard against him the faithful sayings of Christ, and the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness will
          ﬂash into your mind and soul. When Satan would overwhelm you with despair, the Holy Spirit will point you to
          the intercession made for you by a living Saviour. Christ is the fragrance, the holy incense, which makes your
          petitions acceptable to the Father. When the light of Christ’s righteousness is fully understood and accepted,
          love, joy, peace, and inexpressible gratitude will pervade the soul, and the language of him who is blessed
          will be “Thy gentleness hath made me great” (Psalm <nobr>18:35).—Signs</nobr> of the Times, Aug. 22,
