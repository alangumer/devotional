    <h1>Purity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Matthew 5:8.</strong></p>
      <p>When one is fully emptied of self, when every false God is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is supplied by the
          inﬂowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith which works by love and puriﬁes the soul from every
          moral and spiritual deﬁlement. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, can work upon the heart, inﬂuencing and
          directing, so that he enjoys spiritual things. He is “after the Spirit” (Romans 8:1), and he minds the things
          of the Spirit. He has no conﬁdence in self; Christ is all in all. Truth is constantly being unfolded by the
          Holy Spirit; he receives with meekness the engrafted word, and he gives the Lord all the glory, saying, “God
          has revealed them unto us by his Spirit” (1 Corinthians 2:10). “Now we have received, not the spirit of the
          world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God”
          (verse 12).</p>
      <p>The Spirit that reveals also works in him the fruits of righteousness. Christ is in him “a well of water
          springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14). He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of
          fruit to the glory of God. What is the character of the fruit borne? “The fruit of the Spirit is love.” Mark
          the <nobr>words—love,</nobr> not hatred; it is joy, not discontent and mourning; peace, not irritation,
          anxiety, and manufactured trials. It is “longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:
          against such there is no law” (Galatians 5:22, 23).</p>
      <p>Those who have this Spirit will be earnest laborers together with God; the heavenly intelligences cooperate
          with them, and they go weighted with the Spirit of the message of truth which they bear. They are a spectacle
          to the world, to angels, and to men. They are ennobled, reﬁned, through the sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit and
          belief of the truth. They have not brought into the treasury of the soul wood, hay, stubble, but gold, silver,
          and precious stones. They speak words of solid sense, and from the treasures of the heart bring forth pure and
          sacred things according to the example of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Home Missionary, November 1, 1893.</p>
