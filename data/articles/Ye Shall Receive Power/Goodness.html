      <p><strong>But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the
          day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justiﬁed, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Matthew
          12:36, 37.</strong></p>
      <p>God would have us individually come into that position where He can bestow His love upon us. He has placed a
          high value upon man, and has redeemed us by the sacriﬁce of His only begotten Son, and we are to see in our
          fellow man the purchase of the blood of Christ. If we have this love one for another, we shall be growing in
          love for God and the truth. We have been pained at heart to see how little love is cherished in our midst.
          Love is a plant of heavenly origin, and if we would have it ﬂourish in our hearts, we must cultivate it daily.
          Mildness, gentleness, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> not being easily provoked, bearing all things, enduring all
          <nobr>things—these</nobr> are the fruits upon the precious tree of love.</p>
      <p>When you are associated together, be guarded in your words. Let your conversation be of such a nature that you
          will have no need of repentance. “Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
          redemption” (Ephesians 4:30). “A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things:
          and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things” (Matthew 12:35). If the love of the truth
          is in your heart, you will talk of the truth. You will talk of the blessed hope that you have in Jesus. If you
          have love in your heart, you will seek to establish and build up your brother in the most holy faith. If a
          word is dropped that is detrimental to the character of your friend or brother, do not encourage this
          <nobr>evil-speaking.</nobr> It is the work of the enemy. Kindly remind the speaker that the Word of God
          forbids that kind of conversation.</p>
      <p>We are to empty the heart of everything that deﬁles the soul temple, that Christ may dwell within. Our Redeemer
          has told us how we may reveal Him to the world. If we cherish His Spirit, if we manifest His love to others,
          if we guard one another’s interest, if we are kind, patient, forbearing, the world will have an evidence by
          the fruits we bear that we are the children of God. It is the unity in the church that enables it to exert a
          conscious inﬂuence upon unbelievers and <nobr>worldlings.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 5, 1888.</p>
