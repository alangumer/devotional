      <p><strong>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of ﬁre, and it sat upon each of them. And they were
          all ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Acts
          2:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>If you search the Scriptures with a meek and teachable spirit, your efforts will be richly rewarded. “The
          natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he
          know them, because they are spiritually discerned” (1 Corinthians 2:14). The Bible should be studied with
          prayer. We should pray as did David, “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law”
          (Psalm 119:18). No man can have insight into the Word of God without the illumination of the Holy Spirit. If
          we will but come into the right position before God, His light will shine upon us in rich, clear rays.</p>
      <p>This was the experience of the early disciples. The Scriptures declare that “when the day of Pentecost was
          fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a
          rushing mighty wind, and it ﬁlled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven
          tongues like as of ﬁre, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost, and began
          to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance” (Acts <nobr>2:1-4).</nobr> God is willing to
          give us a similar blessing, when we seek for it as earnestly.</p>
      <p>The Lord did not lock the reservoir of heaven after pouring His Spirit upon the early disciples. We, also, may
          receive of the fullness of His blessing. Heaven is full of the treasures of His grace, and those who come to
          God in faith may claim all that He has promised. If we do not have His power, it is of our spiritual lethargy,
          our indifference, our indolence. Let us come out of this formality and deadness.</p>
      <p>There is a great work to be done for this time, and we do not half realize what the Lord is willing to do for
          His people. We talk about the ﬁrst angel’s message, and the second angel’s message, and we think we have some
          understanding of the third angel’s message; but we should not be satisﬁed with our present knowledge. Our
          petitions, mingled with faith and contrition, should go up to God, for an understanding of the mysteries that
          God would make known to His <nobr>saints.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 4, 1889.</p>
