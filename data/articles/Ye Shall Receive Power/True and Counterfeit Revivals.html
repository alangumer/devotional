    <h1>True and Counterfeit Revivals</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of
          her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. Revelation 18:4.</strong></p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the widespread declension of faith and piety, there are true followers of Christ in these
          churches. Before the ﬁnal visitation of God’s judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the
          Lord such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit and
          power of God will be poured out upon His children. At that time many will separate themselves from those
          churches in which the love of this world has supplanted love for God and His Word. Many, both of ministers and
          people, will gladly accept those great truths which God has caused to be proclaimed at this time to prepare a
          people for the Lord’s second coming.</p>
      <p>The enemy of souls desires to hinder this work; and before the time for such a movement shall come, he will
          endeavor to prevent it by introducing a counterfeit. In those churches which he can bring under his deceptive
          power he will make it appear that God’s special blessing is poured out; there will be manifest what is thought
          to be great religious interest. Multitudes will exult that God is working marvelously for them, when the work
          is that of another spirit. Under a religious guise, Satan will seek to extend his inﬂuence over the Christian
          world.</p>
      <p>In many of the revivals which have occurred during the last half century, the same inﬂuences have been at work,
          to a greater or less degree, that will be manifest in the more extensive movements of the future. There is an
          emotional excitement, a mingling of the true with the false, that is well adapted to mislead. Yet none need be
          deceived. In the light of God’s Word it is not difﬁcult to determine the nature of these
          <nobr>movements.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 464.</p>
