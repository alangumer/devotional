    <h1>The Spirit Moves Among Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 1 John
          4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Though we cannot see the Spirit of God, we know that men who have been dead in trespasses and sins become
          convicted and converted under its operations. The thoughtless and wayward become serious. The hardened repent
          of their sins, and the faithless believe. The gambler, the drunkard, the licentious, become steady, sober, and
          pure. The rebellious and obstinate become meek and Christlike. When we see these changes in the character, we
          may be assured that the converting power of God has transformed the entire man. We saw not the Holy Spirit,
          but we saw the evidence of His work on the changed character of those who were hardened and obdurate sinners.
          As the wind moves in its force upon the lofty trees and brings them down, so the Holy Spirit can work upon
          human hearts, and no ﬁnite man can circumscribe the work of God.</p>
      <p>The Spirit of God is manifested in different ways upon different men. One under the movings of this power will
          tremble before the Word of God. His convictions will be so deep that a hurricane and tumult of feeling seem to
          rage in his heart, and his whole being is prostrate under the convicting power of the truth. When the Lord
          speaks forgiveness to the repenting soul, he is full of ardor, full of love to God, full of earnestness and
          energy, and the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> Spirit which he has received cannot be repressed. Christ is in him, a
          well of water springing up into everlasting life. His feelings of love are as deep and ardent as was his
          distress and agony. His soul is like the fountain of the great deep broken up, and he pours forth his
          thanksgiving and praise, his gratitude and joy, until the heavenly harps are tuned to notes of rejoicing. He
          has a story to tell, but not in any precise, common, methodical way. He is a soul ransomed through the merits
          of Jesus Christ, and his whole being is thrilled with the realization of the salvation of
          <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 5, 1896.</p>
