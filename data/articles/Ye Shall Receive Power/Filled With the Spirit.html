      <p><strong>And the disciples were ﬁlled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost. Acts 13:52.</strong></p>
      <p>The work of the Holy Spirit is immeasurably great. It is from this Source that power and efﬁciency come to the
          worker for God; and the Holy Spirit is the Comforter, as the personal presence of Christ to the soul. He who
          looks to Christ in simple, childlike faith is made a partaker of the divine nature through the agency of the
          Holy Spirit. When led by the Spirit of God, the Christian may know that he is made complete in Him who is the
          head of all things. As Christ was gloriﬁed on the day of Pentecost, so will He again be gloriﬁed in the
          closing work of the gospel, when He shall prepare a people to stand the ﬁnal test, in the closing conﬂict of
          the great controversy.</p>
      <p>When the earth is lightened with the glory of God, we shall see a work similar to that which was wrought when
          the disciples, ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit, proclaimed the power of a risen Saviour. The light of heaven
          penetrated the darkened minds of those who had been deceived by the enemies of Christ, and the false
          representation of Him was rejected; for through the efﬁcacy of the Holy Spirit, they now saw Him exalted to be
          a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins. Christ was gloriﬁed through the
          power of the Holy Spirit resting upon men.</p>
      <p>The revelation of Christ by the Holy Spirit brought to them a realizing sense of His power and majesty, and
          they stretched forth their hands unto Him by faith, saying, “I believe.” Thus it was in the time of the early
          rain; but the latter rain will be more abundant. The Saviour of men will be gloriﬁed, and the earth will be
          lightened with the bright shining of the beams of His righteousness. He is the fountain of light, and light
          from the gates ajar has been shining upon the people of God, that they may lift Him up in His glorious
          character before those who sit in <nobr>darkness.—The</nobr> Home Missionary, November 1, 1893.</p>
