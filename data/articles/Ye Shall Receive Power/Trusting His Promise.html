    <h1>Trusting His Promise</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and ﬁnd grace to help
          in time of need. Hebrews 4:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord will not leave His afﬂicted, tried children to be the sport of Satan’s temptations. It is our
          privilege to trust in Jesus. The heavens are full of rich blessings, and it is our privilege to have the joy
          of Christ in us that our joy may be full. We have not because we ask not, or because we do not pray in faith,
          believing that we shall be blessed with the special inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit. To the true seeker through
          the mediation of Christ the gracious inﬂuences of the Holy Spirit are imparted in order that the receiver may
          impart a knowledge of saving truth.</p>
      <p>Why do we not believe the plain “Thus saith the Lord”? Do not cease to pray under any circumstances. The Spirit
          may be willing but the ﬂesh may be weak, but Jesus knows all about that. In your weakness you are not to be
          anxious; for anxiety means doubt and distrust. You are simply to believe that Christ is able to save unto the
          uttermost all who come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for us.</p>
      <p>What does intercession comprehend? It is the golden chain which binds ﬁnite man to the throne of the inﬁnite
          God. The human agent whom Christ has died to save importunes the throne of God, and his petition is taken up
          by Jesus, who has purchased him with His own blood. Our great High Priest places His righteousness on the side
          of the sincere suppliant, and the prayer of Christ blends with that of the human petitioner.</p>
      <p>Christ has urged that His people pray without ceasing. This does not mean that we should always be upon our
          knees, but that prayer is to be as the breath of the soul. Our silent requests, wherever we may be, are to be
          ascending unto God, and Jesus, our advocate, pleads in our behalf, bearing up with the incense of His
          righteousness our requests to the Father.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus loves His people, and when they put their trust in Him, depending wholly upon Him, He
          strengthens them. He will live through them, giving them the inspiration of His sanctifying Spirit, imparting
          to the soul a vital transfusion of <nobr>Himself.—Sabbath</nobr> School Worker, February 1, 1896.</p>
