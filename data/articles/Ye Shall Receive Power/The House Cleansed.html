    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Psalm 51:10.</strong></p>
      <p>“Create in me a clean heart.” This is beginning right, at the very foundation of Christian character; for out
          of the heart are the issues of life. If all, ministers and people, would see to it that their hearts are right
          with God, we should see much larger results from the labor put forth. The more important and responsible your
          work, the greater the necessity that you have clean hearts. The needed grace is provided, and the power of the
          Holy Spirit will work with every effort you make in this direction.</p>
      <p>If every child of God would seek Him earnestly and perseveringly, there would be a greater growth in grace.
          Dissensions would cease; believers would be of one heart and one mind; and purity and love would prevail in
          the church. By beholding we become changed. The more you contemplate the character of Christ, the more you
          will become conformed to His image. Come to Jesus just as you are, and He will receive you, and put a new song
          in your mouth, even praise to God.</p>
      <p>“Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me” (Psalm 51:11). Repentance as well as
          forgiveness is the gift of God through Christ. It is through the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit that we are
          convinced of sin, and feel our need of pardon. None but the contrite are forgiven; but it is the grace of the
          Lord that makes the heart penitent. He is acquainted with all our weaknesses and inﬁrmities, and He will help
          us. He will hear the prayer of faith; but the sincerity of prayer can be proved only by our efforts to bring
          ourselves into harmony with the great moral standard which will test every man’s character.</p>
      <p>We need to open our hearts to the inﬂuence of the Spirit, and to experience its transforming power. The reason
          that you do not receive more of the saving help of God is because the channel of communication between Heaven
          and your own souls is clogged by worldliness, love of display, and desire for supremacy. While some are
          conforming more and more to the world’s customs and maxims, we should be molding our lives after the divine
          model. And our <nobr>covenant-keeping</nobr> God will restore unto us the joys of His salvation, and uphold us
          by His free <nobr>Spirit.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 24, 1884.</p>
