    <h1>Believing in His Guidance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Howbeit we speak wisdom
          among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to
          nought: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the
          world unto our glory. 1 Corinthians <nobr>2:5-7.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>You are accepted in the Beloved. I have had the most earnest desire that you should perfect a Christian
          character, not in your own strength, but in the strength and in the virtue and righteousness of Christ. The
          donation of the Holy Spirit was the greatest gift God could bestow upon ﬁnite man. This is free to all and in
          this gift there could be no computation; this endowment specially signalized the enthronement of the only
          begotten Son of God in His mediatorial kingdom. In this, the gift of the Comforter, the Lord God of heaven
          demonstrates to man the perfect reconciliation which He had effected between Himself and men. “Which hope,”
          says the apostle, “we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that
          within the veil, whither the forerunner is for us entered” (Hebrews 6:19, 20).</p>
      <p>Has not God said He would give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him? And is not this Spirit a real, true,
          actual Guide? Some men seem afraid to take God at His word, as though it would be presumption in them. They
          pray for the Lord to teach us and yet are afraid to credit the pledged word of God and believe we have been
          taught of Him. So long as we come to our heavenly Father humbly and with a spirit to be taught, willing and
          anxious to learn, why should we doubt God’s fulﬁllment of His own promise? You must not for a moment doubt Him
          and dishonor Him thereby.</p>
      <p>When you have sought to know His will, your part in the operation with God is to believe that you will be led
          and guided and blessed in the doing of His will. We may mistrust ourselves lest we misinterpret His teachings,
          but make even this a subject of prayer, and trust Him, still trust Him to the uttermost, that His Holy Spirit
          will lead you to interpret aright His plans and the working of His <nobr>providence.—Manuscript</nobr>
          Releases 6:223, 224.</p>
