      <p><strong>And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was
          lightened with his glory. Revelation 18:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Day after day is passing into eternity, bringing us nearer to the close of probation. Now we must pray as never
          before for the Holy Spirit to be more abundantly bestowed upon us, and we must look for its sanctifying
          inﬂuence to come upon the workers, that the people for whom they labor may know that they have been with Jesus
          and learned of Him. We need spiritual eyesight now as never before, that we may see afar off, and that we may
          discern the snares and designs of the enemy, and as faithful watchmen proclaim the danger. We need spiritual
          power that we may take in, as far as the human mind can, the great subjects of Christianity, and how
          <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> are its principles.</p>
      <p>When God’s people humble the soul before Him, individually seeking His Holy Spirit with all the heart, there
          will be heard from human lips such a testimony as is represented in this Scripture: “After these things I saw
          another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory”
          (Revelation 18:1). There will be faces aglow with the love of God, there will be lips touched with holy ﬁre,
          saying, “The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).</p>
      <p>Those who are under the inﬂuence of the Spirit of God will not be fanatical, but calm, steadfast, free from
          extravagance. But let all who have had the light of truth shining clear and distinct upon their pathway, be
          careful how they cry peace and safety. Be careful what inﬂuence you exert at this time.</p>
      <p>Jesus longs to bestow the heavenly endowment in large measure upon His people. Prayers are ascending to God
          daily for the fulﬁllment of the promise; and not one of the prayers put up in faith is lost. Christ ascended
          on high, leading captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. When, after Christ’s ascension, the Spirit came
          down as promised, like a rushing, mighty wind, ﬁlling the whole place where the disciples were assembled, what
          was the effect?</p>
      <p>Thousands were converted in a day. We have taught, we have expected that an angel is to come down from heaven,
          that the earth will be lightened with his glory, when we shall behold an ingathering of souls similar to that
          witnessed on the day of <nobr>Pentecost.—The</nobr> Home Missionary, November 1, 1893.</p>
