      <p><strong>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the
          deceitful lusts. Ephesians 4:22.</strong></p>
      <p>John says, “The <nobr>light”—Christ—“shineth</nobr> in darkness,” that is, in the world, “and the darkness
          comprehended it not.... But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,</p>
      <p>even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the ﬂesh, nor of the
          will of man, but of God” (John <nobr>1:5-13).</nobr> The reason why the unbelieving world is not saved is that
          they do not choose to be enlightened. The old nature, born of blood and the will of the ﬂesh, cannot inherit
          the kingdom of God. The old ways, the hereditary tendencies, the former habits, must be given up; for grace is
          not inherited. The new birth consists in having new motives, new tastes, new tendencies.</p>
      <p>Those who are begotten unto a new life by the Holy Spirit have become partakers of the divine nature, and in
          all their habits and practices, they will give evidence of their relationship to Christ. When men who claim to
          be Christians retain all their natural defects of character and disposition, in what does their position
          differ from that of the worldling? They do not appreciate the truth as a sanctiﬁer, a reﬁner. They have not
          been born again....</p>
      <p>Let none feel that their way needs no changing. Those who decide thus are not ﬁtted to engage in the work of
          God, for they will not feel the necessity of pressing constantly toward a higher standard, making continual
          improvement. None can walk safely unless they are distrustful of self, and are constantly looking to the work
          of God, studying it with willing heart to see their own errors, and to learn the will of Christ, and praying
          that it may be done in and by and through them. They show that their conﬁdence is not in themselves, but in
          Christ. They hold the truth as a sacred treasure, able to sanctify and reﬁne, and they are constantly seeking
          to bring their words and ways into harmony with its principles. They fear and tremble lest something savoring
          of self shall be idolized, and thus their defects be reproduced in others who conﬁde in them. They are always
          seeking to subdue self, to put away everything that savors of it, and to supply the place with the meekness
          and lowliness of Christ. They are looking unto Jesus, growing up into Him, gathering from Him light and grace,
          that they may diffuse the same to <nobr>others.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 12, 1892.</p>
