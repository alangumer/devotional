    <h1>Impressing Minds Through the Books</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I,
          Here am I; send me. Isaiah 6:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Pray and work. More will be accomplished by the Christlike humble prayer than by many words without prayer.
          Work in simplicity, and the Lord will work with the canvasser. The Holy Spirit will impress minds just as He
          impresses the minds of those who listen to the words of God’s delegated ministers, who preach His Word. The
          same ministry of holy angels attends the one who gives himself to canvassing for books for the educating of
          the people as to what is truth.</p>
      <p>Men and women can work in lines effectually if they feel in their hearts that they are doing the work of the
          Lord in ministering to the souls who know not the truth for this time. They are sounding the note of warning
          in the byways and highways to prepare a people for the great day of God which is about to break upon the
          world. We have no time to lose. We must encourage this work. Who will go forth now with our publications? Let
          them read the sixth chapter of Isaiah, and take its lesson home to their hearts.</p>
      <p>“Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
          people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Then ﬂew one of the seraphims
          unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it
          upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
          Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I;
          send me” (Isaiah <nobr>6:5-8).</nobr></p>
      <p>This representation will be acted over and over again if the canvassers are pressing close to the side of
          Christ, wearing His yoke, and daily learning of Him how to carry messages of peace and comfort to the
          sorrowing, disappointed ones, the sad and brokenhearted. By imbuing them with His own Spirit, Christ the great
          teacher is ﬁtting them to do a good and important <nobr>work.—The</nobr> Bible Echo, September 18, 1899.</p>
