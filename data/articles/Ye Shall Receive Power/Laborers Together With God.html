    <h1>Laborers Together With God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building. 1 Corinthians
          3:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit must be the living agency to convince of sin. The divine agent presents to the speaker the
          beneﬁts of the sacriﬁce made upon the cross; and as the truth is brought in contact with the souls present,
          Christ wins them to Himself, and works to transform their nature. He is ready to help our inﬁrmities, to
          teach, to lead, to inspire us with ideas that are of heavenly birth.</p>
      <p>How little can men do in the work of saving souls, and yet how much through Christ, if they are imbued with His
          Spirit! The human teacher cannot read the hearts of his hearers; but Jesus dispenses the grace that every soul
          needs. He understands the capabilities of man, his weakness and his strength. The Lord is working on the human
          heart; and a minister can be to the souls who are listening to his words a savor of death unto death, turning
          them away from Christ; or, if he is consecrated, devotional, distrustful of self, but looking unto Jesus, he
          may be a savor of life unto life to souls who are already under the convicting power of the Holy Spirit, and
          in whose hearts the Lord is preparing the way for the messages which He has given to the human agent. Thus the
          heart of the unbeliever is touched, and it responds to the message of truth.</p>
      <p>“We are labourers together with God.” The convictions implanted in the heart, and the enlightenment of the
          understanding by the entrance of the Word, work in perfect harmony. The truth brought before the mind has
          power to arouse the dormant energies of the soul. The Spirit of God working in the heart cooperates with the
          working of God through His human instrumentalities.</p>
      <p>Again and again I have been shown that the people of God in these last days could not be safe in trusting in
          men, and making ﬂesh their arm. The mighty cleaver of truth has taken them out of the world as rough stones
          that are to be hewed and squared and polished for the heavenly building. They must be hewed by the prophets
          with reproof, warning, admonition, and advice, that they may be fashioned after the divine Pattern; this is
          the speciﬁed work of the <nobr>Comforter—to</nobr> transform heart and character, that men may keep the way of
          the <nobr>Lord.—The</nobr> Home Missionary, November 1, 1893.</p>
