      <p><strong>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his
          Spirit in the inner man. Ephesians 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The gospel of Christ makes progress in every human agent that is consecrated to the Lord’s service. The Holy
          Spirit takes possession of everyone who has a willing mind, not that that person may work the Holy Spirit, but
          that the Holy Spirit may work its miracle through the grace that is poured upon the human agency. The goodness
          of God becomes a working power through a consistent life, through fervent love for Jesus, and through
          <nobr>heaven-inspired</nobr> zeal. Those who are in association with Jesus will partake of His melting love,
          and manifest His overﬂowing sympathy for souls who are yielding to Satan’s specious temptations. They will
          plan and study and exercise tact, in order that they may make a success of so presenting the unselﬁsh love of
          Christ that sinful and impenitent hearts may be won to loyalty to Jesus, who gave His life for them....</p>
      <p>Lose no time; confess Christ without delay. It is the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, the Spirit of truth that
          testiﬁes of Christ. Jesus said, “Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye
          shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of
          the earth” (Acts 1:8).</p>
      <p>To grieve the Holy Spirit which would make you a witness of Christ is a terrible thing. You know not when you
          may grieve the Spirit for the last time. The Holy Spirit does not work upon the human heart to compel you to
          give yourself to Christ, to force you to yield your conscience: but [the Spirit] shines into the chambers of
          the mind in a way to convict of sin, and to entice you unto righteousness. If you do not confess Christ now,
          the time will come when, overwhelmed with a sense of the great things that you have lost, you will make
          confession. But why not confess Christ now while mercy’s voice invites <nobr>you?—The</nobr> Youth’s
          Instructor, August 1, 1895.</p>
