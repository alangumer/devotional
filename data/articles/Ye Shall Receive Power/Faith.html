    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Hebrews
          11:1.</strong></p>
      <p>In coming to Christ there must be an exercise of faith. We need to bring Him into our everyday life; then we
          shall have peace and joy, and we shall know by experience the meaning of His word, “If ye keep my
          commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love”
          (John 15:10). Our faith must claim the promise, that we may abide in the love of Jesus. Jesus said, “These
          things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full” (verse
          11).</p>
      <p>Faith works by love and puriﬁes the soul. Through faith the Holy Spirit ﬁnds access to the heart, and creates
          holiness therein. Man cannot become an agent to work the works of Christ unless he is in communion with God
          through the Holy Spirit. We can be ﬁtted for heaven only through a transformation of character; we must have
          Christ’s righteousness as our credentials, if we would ﬁnd access to the Father. We must be partakers of the
          divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. We must daily be transformed
          by the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit; for it is the work of the Holy Spirit to elevate the taste, to sanctify
          the heart, to ennoble the whole man, by presenting to the soul the matchless charms of Jesus.</p>
      <p>We are to behold Christ, and by beholding to become changed. We must come to Him, as to an open, inexhaustible
          fountain, from which we may drink again and again, and ever ﬁnd a fresh supply. We are to respond to the
          drawing of His love, to feed on the Bread of Life which came down from heaven, to drink of the Water of Life
          which ﬂows from the throne of God. We are to keep looking up, that faith may bind us to the throne of God. Do
          not look down, as though you were bound to the earth. Do not keep up an examination of your faith, pulling it
          up, as though it were a ﬂower, to see if it has any root. Faith grows <nobr>imperceptibly.—The</nobr> Bible
