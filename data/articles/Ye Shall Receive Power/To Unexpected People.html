    <h1>To Unexpected People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and
          all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: for these are not drunken, as
          ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.
          Acts <nobr>2:14-16.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The baptism of the Holy Ghost as on the day of Pentecost will lead to a revival of true religion and to the
          performance of many wonderful works. Heavenly intelligences will come among us, and men will speak as they are
          moved upon by the Holy Spirit of God. But should the Lord work upon men as He did on and after the day of
          Pentecost, many who now claim to believe the truth would know so very little of the operation of the Holy
          Spirit that they would cry, “Beware of fanaticism.” They would say of those who were ﬁlled with the Spirit,
          “These men are full of new wine” (Acts 2:13).</p>
      <p>The time is not far off now when men will want a much closer relation to Christ, a much closer union with His
          Holy Spirit than ever they have had, or will have, unless they give up their will and their way, and submit to
          God’s will and God’s way. The great sin of those who profess to be Christians is that they do not open the
          heart to receive the Holy Spirit. When souls long after Christ, and seek to become one with Him, then those
          who are content with the form of godliness exclaim, “Be careful, do not go to extremes.” When the angels of
          heaven come among us, and work through human agents, there will be solid, substantial conversions, after the
          order of the conversions after the day of Pentecost.</p>
      <p>Now brethren, be careful and do not go into or try to create human excitement. But while we should be careful
          not to go into human excitement, we should not be among those who will raise inquiries and cherish doubts in
          reference to the work of the Spirit of God; for there will be those who will question and criticize when the
          Spirit of God takes possession of men and women, because their own hearts are not moved, but are cold and
          <nobr>unimpressible.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:57.</p>
