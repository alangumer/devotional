    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a
          little child: I know not how to go out or come in. And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou
          hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. Give therefore thy servant an
          understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge
          this thy so great a people? 1 Kings <nobr>3:7-9.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The name of Jehovah was greatly honored during the ﬁrst part of Solomon’s reign. The wisdom and righteousness
          revealed by the king bore witness to all nations of the excellency of the attributes of the God whom he
          served. For a time Israel was as the light of the world, showing forth the greatness of Jehovah. Not in the
          surpassing wisdom, the fabulous riches, the <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> power and fame that were his, lay the
          real glory of Solomon’s early reign; but in the honor that he brought to the name of the God of Israel through
          a wise use of the gifts of heaven.</p>
      <p>As the years went by and Solomon’s fame increased, he sought to honor God by adding to his mental and spiritual
          strength, and by continuing to impart to others the blessings he received. None understood better than he that
          it was through the favor of Jehovah that he had come into possession of power and wisdom and understanding,
          and that these gifts were bestowed that he might give to the world a knowledge of the King of kings.</p>
      <p>Solomon took an especial interest in natural history, but his researches were not conﬁned to any one branch of
          learning. Through a diligent study of all created things, both animate and inanimate, he gained a clear
          conception of the Creator. In the forces of nature, in the mineral and the animal world, and in every tree and
          shrub and ﬂower, he saw a revelation of God’s wisdom; and as he sought to learn more and more, his knowledge
          of God and his love for Him constantly <nobr>increased.—Prophets</nobr> and Kings, 32, 33.</p>
