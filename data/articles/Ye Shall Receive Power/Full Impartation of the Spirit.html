    <h1>Full Impartation of the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it ﬁlled all the house
          where they were sitting. Acts 2:2.</strong></p>
      <p>When the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost, it was like a rushing, mighty wind. [The Spirit] was
          given in no stinted measure; for it ﬁlled all the place where the disciples were sitting. So will it be given
          to us when our hearts are prepared to receive it.</p>
      <p>Let every church member kneel before God, and pray earnestly for the impartation of the Spirit. Cry, “Lord,
          increase my faith. Make me to understand Thy word; for the entrance of Thy word giveth light. Refresh me by
          Thy presence. Fill my heart with Thy Spirit that I may love my brethren as Christ loves me.” God will bless
          those who thus prepare themselves for His service. They will understand what it means to have the assurance of
          the Spirit, because they have received Christ by faith. The religion of Christ means</p>
      <p>more than the forgiveness of sin; it means that sin is taken away, and that the vacuum is ﬁlled with the
          Spirit. It means that the mind is divinely illumined, that the heart is emptied of self, and ﬁlled with the
          presence of Christ. When this work is done for church members, the church will be a living, working
          church.</p>
      <p>We are to seek most earnestly to be of one mind, of one purpose. The baptism of the Holy Spirit, and nothing
          less, can bring us to this place. Let us by <nobr>self-renunciation</nobr> prepare our hearts to receive the
          Holy Spirit that a great work may be done for us, so that we can say, not “See what I am doing,” but “Behold
          the goodness and love of God!” ...</p>
      <p>We may talk of the blessings of the Holy Spirit, but unless we prepare ourselves for its reception, of what
          avail are our works? Are we striving with all our power to attain to the stature of men and women in Christ?
          Are we seeking for His fullness, ever pressing toward the mark set before <nobr>us—the</nobr> perfection of
          His <nobr>character?—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 10, 1902.</p>
