    <h1>Expecting Great Things</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know
          the things that are freely given to us of God. 1 Corinthians 2:12.</strong></p>
      <p>It is not because of any restriction on God’s part that the riches of His grace do not ﬂow to men. His gift is
          godlike. He gave with a liberality that men do not appreciate because they do not love to receive. If all were
          willing to receive, all would be ﬁlled with the Spirit. By resting content with small blessings, we disqualify
          ourselves for receiving the Spirit in ... unlimited fullness. We are too easily satisﬁed with a ripple on the
          surface, when it is our privilege to expect the deep moving of the Spirit of God. Expecting little, we receive
          little.</p>
      <p>The necessity of the Holy Spirit’s working should be realized by all. Unless this Spirit is accepted and
          cherished as the representative of Christ, whose work it is to renew and sanctify the entire being, the
          momentous truths that have been entrusted to human beings will lose their power on the mind. It is not enough
          for us to have a knowledge of the truth. We are to walk and work in love, conforming our will to the will of
          God. Of those who do this the Lord declares, “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their
          hearts” (Hebrews 8:10). God is the mighty, <nobr>all-powerful</nobr> agency in this work of transformation. By
          His Holy Spirit He writes His law in the heart.</p>
      <p>Thus divine relationship is renewed between God and man. “I will be to them a God,” He says, “and they shall be
          to Me a people” (see Exodus 6:7; Jeremiah 31:33). “There is no attribute of My nature that I will not freely
          give in order than man may reveal My image.” When we allow God to work His will in us, we shall harbor no sin.
          In the reﬁning furnace all dross will be consumed.</p>
      <p>When the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost, it was like a rushing, mighty wind. [The Spirit] was
          given in no stinted measure; for He ﬁlled all the place where the disciples were sitting. So will it be given
          to us when our hearts are prepared to receive <nobr>Him.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 10, 1902.</p>
