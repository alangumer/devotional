    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth
          himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 2 Timothy
          2:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>We have only a little while to urge the warfare; then Christ will come, and this scene of rebellion will close.
          Then our last efforts will have been made to work with Christ and advance His kingdom. Some who have stood in
          the forefront of the battle, zealously resisting incoming evil, fall at the post of duty; others gaze
          sorrowfully at the fallen heroes, but have no time to cease work. They must close up the ranks, seize the
          banner from the hand palsied by death, and with renewed energy vindicate the truth and the honor of Christ. As
          never before, resistance must be made against <nobr>sin—against</nobr> the powers of darkness. The time
          demands energetic and determined activity on the part of those who believe present truth. They should teach
          the truth by both precept and example.</p>
      <p>If the time seems long to wait for our Deliverer to come, if, bowed by afﬂiction and worn with toil, we feel
          impatient for our commission to close, and to receive an honorable release from the warfare, let us
          <nobr>remember—and</nobr> let the remembrance check every <nobr>murmur—that</nobr> God leaves us on earth to
          encounter storms and conﬂicts, to perfect Christian character, to become better acquainted with God our Father
          and Christ our Elder Brother, and to do work for the Master in winning many souls to Christ, that with glad
          heart we may hear the words: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into the joy of thy
          Lord” (Matthew 25:21).</p>
      <p>Be patient, Christian soldier. Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come. The night of weary
          waiting, and watching, and mourning is nearly over. The reward will soon be given; the eternal day will dawn.
          There is no time to sleep <nobr>now—no</nobr> time to indulge in useless regrets. He who ventures to slumber
          now will miss precious opportunities of doing good. We are granted the blessed privilege of gathering sheaves
          in the great harvest; and every soul saved will be an additional star in the crown of Jesus, our adorable
          Redeemer. Who is eager to lay off the armor, when by pushing the battle a little longer he will achieve new
          victories and gather new trophies for <nobr>eternity?—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 25, 1881.</p>
