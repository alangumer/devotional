    <h1>Reasons for the Gift: To Deﬁne Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou
          art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. Daniel 9:23.</strong></p>
      <p>After the passing of the time in 1844 we searched for the truth as for hidden treasure. I met with the
          brethren, and we studied and prayed earnestly. Often we remained together until late at night, and sometimes
          through the entire night, praying for light and studying the Word. Again and again these brethren came
          together to study the Bible, in order that they might know its meaning, and be prepared to teach it with
          power. When they came to the point in their study where they said, “We can do nothing more,” the Spirit of the
          Lord would come upon me. I would be taken off in vision, and a clear explanation of the passages we had been
          studying would be given me, with instruction as to how we were to labor and teach effectively. Thus light was
          given that helped us to understand the scriptures in regard to Christ, His mission, and His priesthood. A line
          of truth extending from that time to the time when we shall enter the city of God was made plain to me, and I
          gave to others the instruction that the Lord had given me.</p>
      <p>During this whole time I could not understand the reasoning of the brethren. My mind was locked, as it were,
          and I could not comprehend the meaning of the scriptures we were studying. This was one of the greatest
          sorrows of my life. I was in this condition of mind until all the principal points of our faith were made
          clear to our minds, in harmony with the Word of God. The brethren knew that, when not in vision, I could not
          understand these matters, and they accepted, as light directly from heaven, the revelations given.</p>
      <p>Many errors arose, and though I was then little more than a child, I was sent by the Lord from place to place
          to rebuke those who were holding these false doctrines. There were those who were in danger of going into
          fanaticism, and I was bidden in the name of the Lord to give them a warning from <nobr>heaven.—The</nobr>
