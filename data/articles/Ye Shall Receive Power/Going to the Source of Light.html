    <h1>Going to the Source of Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. Psalm
          119:130.</strong></p>
      <p>It is sometimes the case that men of intellectual ability, improved by education and culture, fail to
          comprehend certain passages of Scripture, while others who are uneducated, whose understanding seems weak and
          whose minds are undisciplined, will grasp the meaning, ﬁnding strength and comfort in that which the former
          declare to be mysterious or pass by as unimportant. Why is this? It has been explained to me that the latter
          class do not rely upon their own understanding. They go to the Source of light, the One who has inspired the
          Scriptures, and with humility of heart ask God for wisdom, and they receive it. There are mines of truth yet
          to be discovered by the earnest seeker.</p>
      <p>Christ represented the truth as treasure hid in a ﬁeld. It does not lie right upon the surface; we must dig for
          it. But our success in ﬁnding it does not depend so much on our intellectual ability as on our humility of
          heart and the faith which will lay hold upon divine aid.</p>
      <p>Without the guidance of the Holy Spirit we shall be continually liable to wrest the Scriptures or to
          misinterpret them. There is much reading of the Bible that is without proﬁt and in many cases is a positive
          injury. When the Word of God is opened without reverence and without prayer; when the thoughts and affections
          are not ﬁxed upon God or in harmony with His will, the mind is clouded with doubt; and in the very study of
          the Bible, skepticism strengthens. The enemy takes control of the thoughts, and he suggests interpretations
          that are not correct.</p>
      <p>Whenever men are not seeking, in word and deed, to be in harmony with God, then, however learned they may be,
          they are liable to err in their understanding of Scripture, and it is not safe to trust to their explanations.
          When we are truly seeking to do God’s will, the Holy Spirit takes the precepts of His Word and makes them the
          principles of the life, writing them on the tablets of the soul. And it is only those who are following the
          light already given that can hope to receive the further illumination of the <nobr>Spirit.—Testimonies</nobr>
          for the Church 5:704, 705.</p>
