    <h1>Cooperating With the Divine Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto
          me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts
          1:8.</strong></p>
      <p>God has determined to leave nothing undone to recover man from the toils of the enemy. After Christ’s
          ascension, the Holy Spirit was given to man to assist all who would cooperate with Him in the reshaping and
          remodeling of the human character. The Holy Spirit’s part of the work has been deﬁned by our Saviour. He says,
          “He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment” (John 16:8). The Holy Spirit is the
          convicter, and sanctiﬁer as well.</p>
      <p>As none can repent of their sins until they are convicted, the necessity of uniting the Spirit with us in our
          labor to reach the fallen is apparent. All of our human abilities will be exercised in vain unless we are
          united to the heavenly intelligences. It is through the lack of knowledge of the vitalizing truth, and the
          corrupting inﬂuence of error, that men are fallen so low, sunk in the depths of sinful degradation. Angels and
          men are to work in harmony to teach the truth of God to those who are unlearned therein, that they may be set
          free from the bonds of sin. It is the truth alone that makes men free. This liberty, this freedom through the
          knowledge of the truth, is to be proclaimed to every creature.</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ, God Himself, and the angels of heaven are interested in this grand and holy work. Man has been
          given the exalted privilege of revealing the divine character by unselﬁshly engaging in the effort to rescue
          man from the pit of ruin into which he has been plunged. Every human being who will submit to be enlightened
          by the Holy Spirit is to be used for the accomplishment of this divinely conceived purpose. Christ is the head
          of His church, and it will glorify Him the more to have every portion of that church engaged in the work for
          the salvation of souls.</p>
      <p>But the human workers need to leave more room for the Holy Spirit to work, that the laborers may be bound
          together, and move forward in the strength of a united body of soldiers. Let all remember that we are “a
          spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men” (1 Corinthians <nobr>4:9).—(Australasian)</nobr> Union
          Conference Record, April 1, 1898.</p>
