    <h1>The Greatest Gift</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us,
          and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22.</strong></p>
      <p>In giving the Holy Spirit, it was impossible for God to give more. To this gift nothing could be added. By it
          all needs are supplied. The Holy Spirit is the vital presence of God, and if appreciated will call forth
          praise and thanksgiving, and will ever be springing up unto everlasting life. The restoration of the Spirit is
          the covenant of grace. Yet how few appreciate this great gift, so costly, yet so free to all who will accept
          it? When faith takes hold of the blessing, there comes rich spiritual good. But too often the blessing is not
          appreciated. We need an enlarged conception in order to comprehend its value....</p>
      <p>Oh, what amazing love and condescension! The Lord Jesus encourages His believing ones to ask for the Holy
          Spirit. By presenting the parental tenderness of God, He seeks to encourage faith in the reception of the
          gift. The heavenly Parent is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than earthly parents
          are to give good gifts to their children.</p>
      <p>What greater thing could be promised? What more is necessary to awaken a response in every soul, to inspire us
          with a longing for the great gift? Shall not our halfhearted supplications be turned into petitions of intense
          desire for this great blessing?</p>
      <p>We do not ask for enough of the good things God has promised. If we would reach up higher and expect more, our
          petitions would reveal the quickening inﬂuence that comes to every soul who asks with the full expectation of
          being heard and answered. The Lord is not gloriﬁed by the tame supplications which show that nothing is
          expected. He desires everyone who believes to approach the throne of grace with earnestness and
          <nobr>assurance.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 7, 1901.</p>
