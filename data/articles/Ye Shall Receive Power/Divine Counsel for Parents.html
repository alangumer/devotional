    <h1>Divine Counsel for Parents</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written
          unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the
          wicked one. 1 John 2:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Parents may understand that as they follow God’s directions in the training of their children, they will
          receive help from on high. They receive much beneﬁt; for as they teach, they learn. Their children will
          achieve victories through the knowledge that they have acquired in keeping the way of the Lord. They are
          enabled to overcome natural and hereditary tendencies to evil. By setting an example of kindness and patience,
          by molding the characters of their children after the divine Pattern, fathers and mothers become qualiﬁed to
          help the youth outside of their homes.</p>
      <p>Parents, it is your work to develop in your children patience, constancy, and genuine love. In dealing aright
          with the children God has given you, you are helping them lay the foundation for pure,
          <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> characters. You are instilling into their minds principles which they will one day
          follow in their own families. The effect of your <nobr>well-directed</nobr> efforts will be seen as they
          conduct their households in the way of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Blessed is the family where father and mother have surrendered themselves to God to do His will! One
          <nobr>well-ordered,</nobr><nobr>well-disciplined</nobr> family tells more in behalf of Christianity than all
          the sermons that can be preached. Such a family gives evidence that the parents have been successful in
          following God’s directions, and that their children will serve Him in the church. Their inﬂuence grows; for as
          they impart, they receive to impart again. The father and mother ﬁnd helpers in their children, who give to
          others the instruction received in the home. The neighborhood in which they live is helped, for in it they
          have become enriched for time and for eternity. The whole family is engaged in the service of the Master; and
          by their godly example, others are inspired to be faithful and true to God in dealing with His ﬂock, His
          beautiful <nobr>ﬂock.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.</p>
