      <p><strong>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and
          increasing in the knowledge of God. Colossians 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>There are some who talk in a regretful way concerning the restraints that the religion of the Bible imposes
          upon those who would follow its teachings. They seem to think that restraint is a great disadvantage, but we
          have reason to thank God with all our heart that He has raised a heavenly barrier between us and the ground of
          the enemy. There are certain tendencies of the natural heart that many think must be followed in order that
          the best development of the individual may result, but that which man thinks essential God sees would not be
          the blessing to humanity which men imagine, for the development of these very traits of character would unﬁt
          them for the mansions above.</p>
      <p>The Lord places men under test and trial that the dross may be separated from the gold, but He forces none. He
          does not bind with fetters and cords and barriers, for they increase disaffection rather than decrease it. The
          remedy for evil is found in Christ as an indwelling Saviour. But in order that Christ may be in the soul, it
          must ﬁrst be emptied of self, then there is a vacuum created that may be supplied by the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>The Lord puriﬁes the heart very much as we air a room. We do not close the doors and windows and throw in some
          purifying substance; but we open the doors and throw wide the windows, and let heaven’s purifying atmosphere
          ﬂow in. The Lord says, “He that doeth truth cometh to the light” (John 3:21). The windows of impulse, of
          feeling, must be opened up toward heaven, and the dust of selﬁshness and earthliness must be expelled. The
          grace of God must sweep through the chambers of the mind, the imagination must have heavenly themes for
          contemplation, and every element of the nature must be puriﬁed and vitalized by the Spirit of
          <nobr>God.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 2:338.</p>
