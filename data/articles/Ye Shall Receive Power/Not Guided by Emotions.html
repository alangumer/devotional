    <h1>Not Guided by Emotions</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. Psalm 119:105.</strong></p>
      <p>Sanctiﬁcation is not a happy ﬂight of feeling, not the work of an instant, but the work of a lifetime. If
          anyone claims that the Lord has sanctiﬁed him, and made him holy, the proof of his claim to the blessing will
          be seen in the fruits of meekness, patience, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> truthfulness, and love. If the
          blessing that those who claim to be sanctiﬁed have received leads them to rely upon some particular emotion,
          and they declare there is no need of searching the Scriptures that they may know God’s revealed will, then the
          supposed blessing is a counterfeit, for it leads its possessors to place value on their own unsanctiﬁed
          emotions and fancies, and to close their ears to the voice of God in His Word.</p>
      <p>Why need those who claim they have had special manifestations of the Spirit, and the witness that their sins
          are all forgiven, conclude that they can lay the Bible aside, and from henceforth walk alone? When we ask
          those who claim to have been instantaneously sanctiﬁed, if they are searching the Scriptures as Jesus told
          them to do, to see if there is not additional truth for them to accept, they answer, “God makes known His will
          to us directly in special signs and revelations, and we can afford to lay the Bible aside.”</p>
      <p>There are thousands who are being deceived by trusting to some special emotion, and discarding the Word of God.
          They are not building upon the only safe and sure <nobr>foundation—the</nobr> Word of God. A religion that is
          addressed to intelligent creatures will produce reasonable evidences of its genuineness, for there will be
          marked results in heart and character. The grace of Christ will be made manifest in their daily conduct. We
          may safely ask those who profess to be sanctiﬁed, Do the fruits of the Spirit appear in your life? Do you
          manifest the meekness and lowliness of Christ, and reveal the fact that you are learning daily in the school
          of Christ, shaping your life after the pattern of His unselﬁsh life?</p>
      <p>The best evidence that any of us can have of our connection with the God of heaven is that we keep His
          commandments. The best proof of faith in Christ is distrust of self and dependence upon God. The only reliable
          proof of our abiding in Christ is to reﬂect His image. Just so far as we do this we give evidence that we are
          sanctiﬁed through the truth, for the truth is exempliﬁed in our daily <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Signs of the
          Times, February 28, 1895.</p>
