    <h1>Soldiers for Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
          having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the
          breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all,
          taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the ﬁery darts of the wicked. And take
          the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Ephesians
          <nobr>6:13-17.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Soldiers engaged in battle have to meet difﬁculties and hardships. Coarse food is given them, and that often in
          limited quantities. They have long marches, day by day, over rough roads and under burning suns, camping out
          at night, sleeping on the bare ground, with only the canopy of heaven for a covering, exposed to drenching
          rains and chilling frosts, hungry, faint, exhausted, now standing as a target for the foe, now in deadly
          encounter. Thus they learn what hardship means. Those who enlist in Christ’s army are also expected to do
          difﬁcult work, and to bear painful trials patiently for Christ’s sake. But those who suffer with Him shall
          also reign with Him.</p>
      <p>Then who of us have entered the service to expect the conveniences of life, to be off duty when we please,
          laying aside the soldier’s armor and putting on the civilian’s dress, sleeping at the post of duty, and so
          exposing the cause of God to reproach? The <nobr>ease-loving</nobr> ones will not practice
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and patient endurance; and when men are wanted to make mighty strokes for God, these
          are not ready to answer, “Here am I; send me.” Hard and trying work has to be done, but blessed are those who
          are ready to do it when their names are called. God will not reward men and women in the next world for
          seeking to be comfortable in this.</p>
      <p>We are now on the battleﬁeld. There is no time for resting, no time for ease, no time for selﬁsh indulgence.
          After gaining one advantage, you must do battle again; you must go on conquering and to conquer, gathering
          fresh strength for fresh struggles. Every victory gained gives an increase of courage, faith, and
          determination. Through divine strength you will prove more than a match for your <nobr>enemies.—The</nobr>
          Signs of the Times, September 7, 1891.</p>
