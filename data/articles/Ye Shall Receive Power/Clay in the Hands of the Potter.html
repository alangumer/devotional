    <h1>Clay in the Hands of the Potter</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another
          vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, O house of
          Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so
          are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. Jeremiah <nobr>18:4-6.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I lay down my pen and lift up my soul in prayer, that the Lord would breathe upon His backslidden people, which
          are as dry bones, that they may live. The end is near, stealing upon us so stealthily, so imperceptibly, so
          noiselessly, like the mufﬂed tread of the thief in the night to surprise the sleepers off guard and unready.
          May the Lord grant to bring His Holy Spirit upon hearts that are now at ease, that they may no longer sleep as
          do others, but watch and be sober.</p>
      <p>Who will consent even now, after wasting much of his lifetime, to give his will as clay into the hands of the
          Potter, and cooperate with God in becoming in His hands molded a vessel unto honor? Oh, how must the clay be
          in the hands of the Potter, how susceptible to receive divine impressions, standing in the bright beams of
          righteousness. No earthly, no selﬁsh motives should be suffered to live, for if you give them place, you
          cannot be hewn into the divine image. The spirit of truth sanctiﬁes the soul.</p>
      <p>When the greatness of this work is comprehended, it will bring even the thoughts into captivity to Christ. This
          is beyond our private comprehension, but thus it will be. Then is it wisdom on our part to put dependence on
          our own works? We must let God work for us. Is there any excellency that appears in our characters or our
          conduct? Does it originate with ﬁnite human beings? No; it is all from God, the great center or expression of
          the power of the potter over the clay.</p>
      <p>Oh, that those whom the Lord has blessed with the treasures of truth would awake and say from the heart, “Lord
          what wilt thou have me to do?” (Acts 9:6). Light is increasing to enlighten every soul who will diffuse the
          light to <nobr>others.—The</nobr> General Conference Daily Bulletin, February 4, 1893.</p>
