    <h1>A Temple for the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God,
          and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your
          spirit, which are God’s. 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>A power above and outside of man is to work upon him, that solid timbers may be brought into his character
          building. In the inner sanctuary of the soul the presence of God is to abide. “And what agreement hath the
          temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
          walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people” (2 Corinthians 6:16). “Know ye not that ye
          are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man deﬁle the temple of God, him
          shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are” (1 Corinthians 3:16, 17)....</p>
      <p>“For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and
          foreigners, but <nobr>fellow-citizens</nobr> with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon
          the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all
          the building ﬁtly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord; ... in whom ye also are builded
          together for an habitation of God through the Spirit” (Ephesians <nobr>2:18-22).</nobr></p>
      <p>Man does not build himself into a habitation for the Spirit, but unless there is a cooperation of man’s will
          with God’s will, the Lord can do nothing for him. The Lord is the great Master Worker, and yet the human agent
          must cooperate with the Divine Worker, or the heavenly building cannot be completed. All the power is of God,
          and all the glory is to redound to God, and yet all the responsibility rests with the human agent; for God can
          do nothing without the cooperation of <nobr>man.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.</p>
