    <h1>Encouragement for the Erring</h1>

      <p><strong>This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in
          him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do
          not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and
          the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 1 John <nobr>1:5-7.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>For half a century I have been the Lord’s messenger, and as long as my life shall last I shall continue to bear
          the messages that God gives me for His people. I take no glory to myself; in my youth the Lord made me His
          messenger, to communicate to His people testimonies of encouragement, warning, and reproof. For sixty years I
          have been in communication with heavenly messengers, and I have been constantly learning in reference to
          divine things, and in reference to the way in which God is constantly working to bring souls from the error of
          their ways to the light in God’s light.</p>
      <p>Many souls have been helped because they have believed that the messages given me were sent in mercy to the
          erring. When I have seen those who needed a different phase of Christian experience, I have told them so, for
          their present and eternal good. And so long as the Lord spares my life, I will do my work faithfully, whether
          or not men and women shall hear and receive and obey. My work is clearly given me to do, and I shall receive
          grace in being obedient.</p>
      <p>I love God. I love Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and I feel an intense interest in every soul who claims to be
          a child of God. I am determined to be a faithful steward so long as the Lord shall spare my life. I will not
          fail nor be discouraged....</p>
      <p>I love the Lord; I love my Saviour, and my life is wholly in the hands of God. As long as He sustains me, I
          shall bear a decided <nobr>testimony.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 5:152, 153.</p>
