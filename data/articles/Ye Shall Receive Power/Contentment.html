      <p><strong>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
          content. Philippians 4:11.</strong></p>
      <p>God has His faithful witnesses who are not attempting to do that which Christ has pronounced
          <nobr>impossible—that</nobr> is, seeking to serve God and mammon at the same time. They are burning and
          shining lights amid the moral darkness of the world, and amid the gross darkness that covers the people like
          the pall of death. The members of the church of Christ are individually to be controlled by the Holy Spirit,
          in order that they may not have a changeable, ﬂuctuating experience. They are to be rooted and grounded in the
          truth.</p>
      <p>When the joy of the saving power of Christ’s righteousness is rightly understood by experimental knowledge,
          there will be vital interest in the church, there will be those who will teach transgressors God’s ways, and
          sinners will be converted to the truth as it is in Jesus. It is the professors of religion that need
          converting; for Satan has brought his deceptions to bear upon their souls.</p>
      <p>The soul that is brought into personal contact with Christ becomes a holy temple unto the Lord; for Jesus is
          made unto the believer wisdom, righteousness, sanctiﬁcation, and redemption. He who has fully surrendered to
          God has a consciousness of Christ’s saving presence. He is a possessor of spiritual patience, and has the rest
          of soul that comes from learning of Him who is meek and lowly of heart. Trusting in Jesus to be his efﬁciency
          and righteousness, his soul is ﬁlled with a pleasant contentment.</p>
      <p>What is the joy of the Christian? It is the result of the consciousness of the presence of Christ. What is the
          love of the Christian? It is the reﬂection of the love of Christ. It is the effect of the operation of the
          Holy Spirit. Looking to the cross of Calvary, we see Jesus dying for the sins of the world, in order that by
          His death, life and immortality might be brought to light in behalf of the contrite soul. Jesus is all in all,
          and without Him we can do nothing. Without Christ, spiritual life would be <nobr>impossible.—The</nobr> Review
          and Herald, December 4, 1894.</p>
