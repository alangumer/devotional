    <h1>The Salt of the Earth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is
          thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Matthew
          5:13.</strong></p>
      <p>God will work with the church, but not without their cooperation. May every one of you who have tasted the good
          Word of God “let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
          which is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus says, “Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
          savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be
          trodden under foot of men.” The saving salt, the savor of the Christian, is the love of Jesus in the heart,
          the righteousness of Christ pervading the soul. If the professor of religion would keep the saving efﬁcacy of
          his faith, he must ever keep the righteousness of Christ before him, and have the glory of God for his
          rearward. Then the power of Christ will be revealed in life and character.</p>
      <p>Oh, when we come to the pearly gates, and have an entrance into the city of God, will anyone who enters there
          regret that he devoted his life unreservedly to Jesus? Let us now love Him with undivided affections, and
          cooperate with the heavenly intelligences, that we may be laborers together with God, and by partaking of the
          divine nature, be able to reveal Christ to others. Oh, for the baptism of the Holy Spirit! Oh, that the bright
          beams of the Sun of Righteousness might shine into the chambers of mind and heart, that every idol might be
          dethroned and expelled from the soul temple! Oh, that our tongues might be loosened to speak of His goodness,
          to tell of His power!</p>
      <p>If you respond to the drawing of Jesus, you will not fail to have an inﬂuence on somebody through the beauty
          and power of the grace of Christ. Let us behold Him and become changed into the image of Him in whom dwelleth
          all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and realize that we are accepted in the Beloved, “complete in him,
          which is the head of all principality and power” (Colossians <nobr>2:10).—Bible</nobr> Echo, February 15,
          1892.</p>
