    <h1>Love: The Best Advertisement for Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. John
          13:35.</strong></p>
      <p>Man may become a fellow laborer with God in carrying out the great work of redemption. God allows each man his
          own sphere of action while He has given His Word as the guide of life. He has also given the Holy Spirit as a
          sufﬁcient power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character
          on the human agent, and, through him, upon all who shall come within the sphere of his inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>The human agent is urged to cooperate with God, to work out His mercy, His goodness, and His love, thus
          impressing other minds. Every man is to become an instrumentality through which the Holy Spirit can work. He
          can become this only by yielding all his capabilities to the control of the Spirit. God gave His Spirit upon
          the day of Pentecost, and through [the Spirit’s] working upon receptive hearts [God] could impress all with
          whom the believers came in contact.</p>
      <p>Through our relation of friendship and familiarity with human beings like ourselves, we may exert an uplifting
          inﬂuence. Those who are united in a common hope and faith in Christ Jesus can be a blessing to one another.
          Jesus says, “Love one another; as I have loved you” (John 13:34). Love is not simply an impulse, a transitory
          emotion, dependent upon circumstances; it is a living principle, a permanent power. The soul is fed by the
          streams of pure love that ﬂow from the heart of Christ, as a wellspring that never fails.</p>
      <p>Oh, how is the heart quickened, how are its motives ennobled, its affections deepened, by this communion! Under
          the education and discipline of the Holy Spirit, the children of God love one another, truly, sincerely,
          unaffectedly, “without partiality, and without hypocrisy” (James 3:17). And this because the heart is in love
          with Jesus. Our affection for one another springs from our common relation to God. We are one family, we love
          one another as He loved us. When compared with this true, sanctiﬁed, disciplined affection, the shallow
          courtesy of the world, the meaningless expressions of effusive friendship, are as chaff to the
          <nobr>wheat.—The</nobr> Ellen G. White 1888 Materials, 1508, 1509.</p>
