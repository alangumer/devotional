      <p><strong>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter
          and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than
          unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. Acts
          <nobr>4:18-20.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The promise of the Holy Spirit was the brightest hope and the strongest consolation that Christ could leave His
          disciples when He ascended to heaven. The truths of God’s Word had been buried beneath the rubbish of
          misinterpretation; the maxims of men, the sayings of ﬁnite beings, had been exalted above the Word of the
          living God. Under the enlightening power of the Holy Spirit, the apostles separated truth from false theories,
          and gave to the people the word of life.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is often rejected because it comes in unexpected ways. Evidence upon evidence that the apostles
          were speaking and acting under divine inspiration had been given to the Jewish priests and rulers, but still
          they ﬁrmly resisted the message of truth. Christ had not come in the way they expected, and though at times
          they were convinced that He was the Son of God, yet they stiﬂed conviction, and thus became blinder and more
          hardened than before. They cruciﬁed Christ, yet Christ in His mercy gave them additional evidence in the works
          wrought by the disciples. He sent His servants to tell them what they had done, and even in the terrible
          charge that they had killed the Prince of life, He gave them another call to repentance. But, feeling secure
          in their own righteousness, the Jewish teachers were not prepared to admit that the men who had reproved them
          for crucifying Christ were speaking by the direction of the Holy Spirit....</p>
      <p>The wrath of God is not declared against men merely because of the sin they have committed, but because they
          choose to continue in a state of resistance, because they repeat the sins of the past in spite of the light
          and evidence given them. If the Jewish leaders had submitted, they would have been pardoned; but they were
          determined not to yield. In the same way, the sinner, by continued resistance, places himself where he knows
          nothing but <nobr>resistance.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September 27, 1899.</p>
