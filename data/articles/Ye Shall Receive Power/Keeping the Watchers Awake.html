    <h1>Keeping the Watchers Awake</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
          nearer than when we believed. Romans 13:11.</strong></p>
      <p>My brethren, you must have Jesus enthroned within, and self must die. We must be baptized with the Holy Spirit,
          and then we shall not sit down, saying unconcernedly, “What is to be will be; prophecy must be fulﬁlled.” Oh,
          awake, I pray you, awake! for you bear the most sacred responsibilities. As faithful watchmen, you should see
          the sword coming, and give the warning, that men and women may not pursue a course through ignorance that they
          would avoid if they knew the truth.</p>
      <p>The Lord has enlightened us in regard to what is coming upon the earth, that we may enlighten others, and we
          shall not be held guiltless if we are content to sit at ease, with folded hands, and quibble over matters of
          minor importance. The minds of many have been engrossed with contentions, and they have rejected the light
          given through the Testimonies, because it did not agree with their own opinions.</p>
      <p>God does not force any man into His service. Every soul must decide for himself whether or not he will fall on
          the Rock and be broken. Heaven has been amazed to see the spiritual stupidity that has prevailed. You need
          individually to open your proud hearts to the Spirit of God, You need to have your intellectual ability
          sanctiﬁed to the service of God. The transforming power of God must be upon you, that your minds may be
          renewed by the Holy Spirit, that you may have the mind that was in Christ.</p>
      <p>If the watchmen sleep under an opiate of Satan’s and do not recognize the voice of the true Shepherd, and do
          not take up the warning, I tell you in the fear of God, they will be charged with the blood of souls. The
          watchmen must be wide awake, men who will not slumber at their post of duty, day nor night. They must give the
          trumpet a certain sound, that the people may shun the evil, and choose the good. Stupidity and careless
          indifference cannot be excused. On every side of us there are breakers and hidden rocks which will dash our
          bark in pieces, and leave us helpless wrecks, unless we make God our refuge and <nobr>help.—The</nobr> Review
          and Herald, December 24, 1889.</p>
