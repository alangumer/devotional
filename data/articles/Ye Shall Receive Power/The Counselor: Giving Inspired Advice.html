    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For out of much afﬂiction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be
          grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 2 Corinthians
          2:4.</strong></p>
      <p>When I went to Colorado I was so burdened for you that, in my weakness, I wrote many pages to be read at your
          camp meeting. Weak and trembling, I arose at three o’clock in the morning to write to you. God was speaking
          through clay. You might say that this communication was only a letter. Yes, it was a letter, but prompted by
          the Spirit of God, to bring before your minds things that had been shown me. In these letters which I write,
          in the testimonies I bear, I am presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to me. I do not write one
          article in the paper, expressing merely my own ideas. They are what God has opened before me in
          <nobr>vision—the</nobr> precious rays of light shining from the throne....</p>
      <p>What voice will you acknowledge as the voice of God? What power has the Lord in reserve to correct your errors
          and show you your course as it is? What power to work in the church? If you refuse to believe until every
          shadow of uncertainty and every possibility of doubt is removed, you will never believe. The doubt that
          demands perfect knowledge will never yield to faith. Faith rests upon evidence, not demonstration. The Lord
          requires us to obey the voice of duty, when there are other voices all around us urging us to pursue an
          opposite course. It requires earnest attention from us to distinguish the voice which speaks from God. We must
          resist and conquer inclination, and obey the voice of conscience without parleying or compromise, lest its
          promptings cease, and will and impulse control.</p>
      <p>The word of the Lord comes to us all who have not resisted His Spirit by determining not to hear and obey. This
          voice is heard in warnings, in counsels, in reproof. It is the Lord’s message of light to His people. If we
          wait for louder calls or better opportunities, the light may be withdrawn, and we left in
          <nobr>darkness.—Selected</nobr> Messages 1:27, 28.</p>
