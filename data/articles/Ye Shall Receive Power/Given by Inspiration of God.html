      <p><strong>Given by Inspiration of God</strong></p>
      <p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is proﬁtable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
          instruction in righteousness. 2 Timothy 3:16.</p>
      <p>The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human hands; and in the varied style of its
          different books it presents the characteristics of the several writers. The truths revealed are all “given by
          inspiration of God”; yet they are expressed in the words of men. The Inﬁnite One by His Holy Spirit has shed
          light into the minds and hearts of His servants. He has given dreams and visions, symbols and ﬁgures; and
          those to whom the truth was thus revealed have themselves embodied the thought in human language.</p>
      <p>The Ten Commandments were spoken by God Himself, and were written by His own hand. They are of divine and not
          of human composition. But the Bible, with its <nobr>God-given</nobr> truths expressed in the language of men,
          presents a union of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of
          God and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, that “the Word was made ﬂesh, and
          dwelt among us” (John 1:14).</p>
      <p>Written in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank and occupation, and in mental and spiritual
          endowments, the books of the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in the nature of
          the subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are employed by different writers; often the same truth
          is more strikingly presented by one than by another. And as several writers present a subject under varied
          aspects and relations, there may appear, to the superﬁcial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy
          or contradiction, where the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight, discerns the underlying
          <nobr>harmony.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, v, vi.</p>
