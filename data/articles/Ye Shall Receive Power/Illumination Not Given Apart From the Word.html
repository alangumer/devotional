    <h1>Illumination Not Given Apart From the Word</h1>

      <p><strong>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders;
          insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Matthew 24:24.</strong></p>
      <p>In these days of delusion, everyone who is established in the truth will have to contend for the faith once
          delivered to the saints. Every variety of error will be brought out in the mysterious working of Satan, which
          would, if it were possible, deceive the very elect, and turn them from the truth. There will be human wisdom
          to <nobr>meet—the</nobr> wisdom of learned men, who, as were the Pharisees, are teachers of the law of God,
          but do not obey the law themselves. There will be human ignorance and folly to meet in disconnected theories
          arrayed in new and fantastic <nobr>dress—theories</nobr> that it will be all the more difﬁcult to meet because
          there is no reason in them.</p>
      <p>There will be false dreams and false visions, which have some truth, but lead away from the original faith. The
          Lord has given men a rule by which to detect them: “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
          according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20). If they belittle the law of
          God, if they pay no heed to His will as revealed in the testimonies of His Spirit, they are deceivers. They
          are controlled by impulse and impressions, which they believe to be from the Holy Spirit, and consider more
          reliable than the Inspired Word. They claim that every thought and feeling is an impression of the Spirit; and
          when they are reasoned with out of the Scriptures, they declare that they have something more reliable. But
          while they think that they are led by the Spirit of God, they are in reality following an imagination wrought
          upon by <nobr>Satan.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:98, 99.</p>
      <p>Satan will work in a most subtle manner to introduce human inventions clothed with angel garments. But the
          light from the Word is shining amid the moral darkness; and the Bible will never be superseded by miraculous
          manifestations. The truth must be studied, it must be searched for as hidden treasure. Wonderful illuminations
          will not be given aside from the Word, or to take the place of it. Cling to the Word, receive the ingrafted
          Word, which will make men wise unto <nobr>salvation.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:100.</p>
