    <h1>The Spirit Visits Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom
          also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. Ephesians 1:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Through the deep movings of the Spirit of God, I have had opened before me the character of the work of the
          visitation of the Spirit of God. I have had opened before me the danger in which souls would be placed who had
          been thus visited; for afterward, they would have to meet ﬁercer assaults of the enemy, who would press upon
          them his temptations to make of none effect the workings of the Spirit of God, and cause that the momentous
          truths presented and witnessed by the Holy Spirit should not purify and sanctify those who had received the
          light of heaven, and thus cause that Christ should not be gloriﬁed in them. The period of great spiritual
          light, if that light is not sacredly cherished and acted upon, will be turned into a time of corresponding
          spiritual darkness. The impression made by the Spirit of God, if men do not cherish the sacred impression, and
          occupy holy ground, will fade from the mind.</p>
      <p>Those who would advance in spiritual knowledge must stand by the very fount of God, and drink again and again
          from the wells of salvation so graciously opened unto them. They must never leave the source of refreshment;
          but with hearts swelling with gratitude and love at the display of the goodness and compassion of God, they
          must be continually partakers of the living water....</p>
      <p>“But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not” (John 6:36). This has been literally fulﬁlled
          in the cases of many; for the Lord gave them a deeper insight into truth, into His character of mercy and
          compassion and love; and yet after being thus enlightened, they have turned from Him in unbelief. They saw the
          deep movings of the Spirit of God; but when the insidious temptations of Satan came in, as they always will
          come after a season of revival, they did not resist unto blood, striving against sin; and those who might have
          stood on vantage ground, had they made a right use of the precious enlightenment that they had, were overcome
          by the enemy. They should have reﬂected the light that God gave to them upon the souls of others; they should
          have worked and acted in harmony with the sacred revealings of the Holy Spirit; and in not doing so, they
          suffered <nobr>loss.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 30, 1894.</p>
