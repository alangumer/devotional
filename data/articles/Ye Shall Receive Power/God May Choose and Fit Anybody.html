      <p><strong>Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his
          might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
          understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness,
          in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord. Jeremiah 9:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord works in His own way, in order that men shall not lift themselves up in pride of intellect, and take
          the credit and the glory to themselves. The Lord would have every human being understand that his capabilities
          and endowments are from the Lord. God works by whom He will. He takes those whom He pleases to do His work,
          and He does not consult those to whom He will send His messenger as to what are their preferences concerning
          whom or what manner of person they would like to bring the message of God to them.</p>
      <p>God will use men who are willing to be used. The Lord would use men of intelligence if they would permit Him to
          mold and fashion them, and to shape their testimony after His own order. Men high or low, learned or ignorant,
          would better let the Lord manage and take care of the safety of His own ark. The work of men is to obey the
          voice of God.</p>
      <p>Whoever has a connection with the work and cause of God is to be continually under the discipline of God. “Thus
          saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let
          not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and
          knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for
          in these things I delight, saith the Lord.” ...</p>
      <p>There are souls famishing for the bread of life, thirsting for the waters of salvation; and woe unto that man
          who by pen or voice shall turn them aside into false paths! The Spirit of God is appealing to men, presenting
          to them their moral obligation to love and serve Him with heart, might, mind, and strength, and to love their
          neighbors as themselves. The Holy Spirit moves upon the inner self until it becomes conscious of the divine
          power of God, and every spiritual faculty is quickened to decided <nobr>action.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          May 12, 1896.</p>
