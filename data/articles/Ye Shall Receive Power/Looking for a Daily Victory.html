    <h1>Looking for a Daily Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may
          obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a
          corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 1 Corinthians 9:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>How many years have we been in the Lord’s garden? And what proﬁt have we brought to the Master? How are we
          meeting the inspecting eye of God? Are we increasing in reverence, love, humility, conﬁdence in God? Do we
          cherish gratitude for all His mercies? Are we seeking to bless those around us? Do we manifest the spirit of
          Jesus in our families? Are we teaching His Word to our children, and making known to them the wonderful works
          of God? The Christian must represent Jesus by both being good and doing good. Then there will be a fragrance
          about the life, a loveliness of character, which will reveal the fact that he is a child of God, an heir of
          heaven.</p>
      <p>Brethren, be no longer slothful servants. Every soul must battle against inclination. Christ came not to save
          men in their sins, but from their sins. He has made it possible for us to possess a holy character; do not,
          then, be content with defects and deformities. But while we are to seek earnestly for perfection of character,
          we must remember that sanctiﬁcation is not the work of a moment, but of a lifetime. Said Paul, “I die daily”
          (1 Corinthians 15:31). Day by day the work of overcoming must go forward. Every day we are to resist
          temptation, and gain the victory over selﬁshness in all its forms.</p>
      <p>Day by day we should cherish love and humility, and cultivate in ourselves all those excellencies of character
          which will please God and ﬁt us for the blessed society of heaven. To all who are seeking to accomplish this
          work, the promise is very precious, “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I
          will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before
          his angels” (Revelation <nobr>3:5).—&lt;span</nobr><nobr>class="egw-eng"</nobr> title="HS 181.1"&gt;Historical
