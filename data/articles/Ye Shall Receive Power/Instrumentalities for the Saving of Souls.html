    <h1>Instrumentalities for the Saving of Souls</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any
          thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>Here are the mighty agencies for moving the world. The cross of Calvary brings under tribute every power of
          those who believe on Christ, that they may be instrumentalities for the saving of souls. Human effort is to be
          united with the divine; it must derive its efﬁcacy from heaven. We are to be laborers together with God. The
          Lord is represented as opening the hearts of men and women to receive the Word, and the Holy Spirit makes the
          Word effective.</p>
      <p>Those who receive the truth have that faith which leads to decided action, which works by love, and puriﬁes the
          soul. Thus the truth is a sanctiﬁer. Its transforming power is seen on the character. When it has been
          admitted into the inner sanctuary of the soul, it does not operate superﬁcially, leaving the heart unchanged;
          it does not awaken the emotions merely, to the neglect of the judgment and will; but it goes down to the very
          depths of the nature, and brings the whole being into harmonious action.</p>
      <p>Now the work of him who is truly converted begins in earnest. He must work as Christ worked. He must not live
          any longer to himself, but wholly for the Lord. The world has lost him; for his life is hid with Christ in
          God. That means that self no longer has the supremacy. The light shining from the cross of Calvary holds him
          in its bright rays, and the Spirit has taken of the things of Christ, and revealed them to him in such an
          attractive light as to have a transforming effect on his habits and practices, showing that he is a new
          creature in Christ Jesus. Every dollar he recognizes as of value, not to gratify his taste or lust, not for
          him to hide in the earth, but to do good with, to help win souls to the truth, to build up the kingdom of
          Christ. His enjoyment is the same as that of <nobr>Christ—in</nobr> seeing souls saved. Why are we doing so
          little for the salvation of men, when there is so much to do? Why are we doing so little to draw men and women
          and children to <nobr>Christ?—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 6, 1891.</p>
