    <h1>Outward Neatness</h1>

      <p><strong>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. She
          maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. Proverbs 31:21, 22.</strong></p>
      <p>Educate, educate, educate. Parents who receive the truth are to conform their habits and practices to the
          directions God has given. The Lord desires all to remember that the service of God is a pure and holy service,
          and that those who receive the truth must be puriﬁed in disposition, in temper, in heart, in conversation, in
          the dress, and in the home, so that the angels of God, unseen by them, shall come in to minister to those who
          shall be heirs of salvation.</p>
      <p>All who join the church should reveal a transformation of character which shows their reverence for holy
          things. Their whole life should be molded after the reﬁnement of Christ Jesus. Those who join the church are
          to be humble enough to receive instruction on the points wherein they are remiss, and wherein they can and
          must change. They must exert a Christian inﬂuence. Those who make no change in words or deportment, in their
          dress or in their homes, are living unto themselves and not unto Christ. They have not been created anew in
          Christ Jesus, unto the purifying of the heart and the outward surroundings.</p>
      <p>Christians will be judged by the fruit they bear in reformatory work. Every true Christian will show what the
          truth of the gospel has done for him. He who has been made a son of God must practice habits of neatness and
          cleanliness. Every action, however small, has an inﬂuence. The Lord desires to make every human being an
          agency through whom Christ can manifest His Holy Spirit. Christians are in no case to be careless or
          indifferent in regard to their outward appearance. They are to be neat and trim, though without adornment.
          They are to be pure inside and <nobr>out.—Testimonies</nobr> to Southern Africa, 87.</p>
