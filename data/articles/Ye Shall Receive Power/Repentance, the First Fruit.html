    <h1>Repentance, the First Fruit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender
          mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Psalm
          51:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>Repentance is one of the ﬁrst fruits of saving grace. Our great Teacher, in His lessons to erring, fallen man,
          presents the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of His grace, declaring that through this grace men and women may
          live the new life of holiness and purity. He who lives this life works out the principles of the kingdom of
          heaven. Taught of God, he leads others in straight paths. He will not lead the lame into paths of uncertainty.
          The working of the Holy Spirit in his life shows that he is a partaker of the divine nature. Every soul thus
          worked by the Spirit of Christ receives so abundant a supply of the rich grace that, beholding his good works,
          the unbelieving world acknowledges that he is controlled and sustained by divine power, and is led to glorify
          <nobr>God.—God’s</nobr> Amazing Grace, 138.</p>
      <p>There are those who, notwithstanding all the gracious invitation of Christ, continue to reveal ungodliness in
          their lives. To such ones God says: “How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? ... Turn you at my
          reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you” (Proverbs 1:22,
          <nobr>23).—Signs</nobr> of the Times, June 28, 1905.</p>
      <p>Repentance for sin is the ﬁrst fruits of the working of the Holy Spirit in the life. It is the only process by
          which inﬁnite purity reﬂects the image of Christ in His redeemed subjects. In Christ all fullness dwells.
          Science that is not in harmony with Him is of no value. He teaches us to count all things but loss for the
          excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord. This knowledge is the highest science that any man can
          <nobr>reach.—The</nobr> SDA Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments, vol. 6, 1068.</p>
