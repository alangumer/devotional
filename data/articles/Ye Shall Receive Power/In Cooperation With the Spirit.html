    <h1>In Cooperation With the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my
          absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Philippians 2:12.</strong></p>
      <p>If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”
          (2 Corinthians 5:17). Nothing but divine power can regenerate the human heart and imbue souls with the love of
          Christ, which will ever manifest itself with love for those for whom He died. The fruit of the Spirit is love,
          joy, peace, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. When a man is converted to
          God, a new moral taste is supplied, a new motive power is given, and he loves the things that God loves; for
          his life is bound up by the golden chain of the immutable promises to the life of Jesus. Love, joy, peace, and
          inexpressible gratitude will pervade the soul, and the language of him who is blessed will be, “Thy gentleness
          hath made me great” (Psalm 18:35).</p>
      <p>But those who are waiting to behold a magical change in their characters without determined effort on their
          part to overcome sin will be disappointed. We have no reason to fear while looking to Jesus, no reason to
          doubt but that He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto Him; but we may constantly fear lest our
          old nature will again obtain the supremacy, that the enemy shall devise some snare whereby we shall again
          become his captives.</p>
      <p>We are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you to will and to
          do of His good pleasure. With our limited powers we are to be as holy in our sphere as God is holy in His
          sphere. To the extent of our ability, we are to make manifest the truth and love and excellence of the divine
          character. As wax takes the impression of the seal, so the soul is to take the impression of the Spirit of God
          and retain the image of Christ.</p>
      <p>We are to grow daily in spiritual loveliness. We shall fail often in our efforts to copy the divine Pattern. We
          shall often have to bow down to weep at the feet of Jesus, because of our shortcomings and mistakes; but we
          are not to be discouraged; we are to pray more fervently, believe more fully, and try again with more
          steadfastness to grow into the likeness of our <nobr>Lord.—Selected</nobr> Messages 1:336, 337.</p>
