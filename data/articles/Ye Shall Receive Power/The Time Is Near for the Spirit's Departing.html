    <h1>The Time Is Near for the Spirit’s Departing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
          come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Revelation 22:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Probationary time will not continue much longer. Now God is withdrawing His restraining hand from the earth.
          Long has He been speaking to men and women through the agency of His Holy Spirit; but they have not heeded the
          call. Now He is speaking to His people, and to the world, by His judgments. The time of these judgments is a
          time of mercy for those who have not yet had opportunity to learn what is truth. Tenderly will the Lord look
          upon them. His heart of mercy is touched; His hand is still stretched out to save. Large numbers will be
          admitted to the fold of safety who in these last days will hear the truth for the ﬁrst time.</p>
      <p>The Lord calls upon those who believe in Him to be workers together with Him. While life shall last, they are
          not to feel that their work is done. Shall we allow the signs of the end to be fulﬁlled without telling people
          of what is coming upon the earth? Shall we allow them to go down in darkness without having urged upon them
          the need of a preparation to meet their Lord? Unless we ourselves do our duty to those around us, the day of
          God will come upon us as a thief. Confusion ﬁlls the world, and a great terror is soon to come upon human
          beings. The end is very near. We who know the truth should be preparing for what is soon to break upon the
          world as an overwhelming surprise.</p>
      <p>As a people, we must prepare the way of the Lord, under the overruling guidance of the Holy Spirit. The gospel
          is to be proclaimed in its purity. The stream of living water is to deepen and widen in its course. In ﬁelds
          nigh and afar off, men will be called from the plow, and from the more common commercial business vocations,
          and will be educated in connection with men of experience. As they learn to labor effectively, they will
          proclaim the truth with power. Through most wonderful workings of divine providence, mountains of difﬁculty
          will be removed.</p>
      <p>The message that means so much to the dwellers upon earth will be heard and understood. Men will know what is
          truth. Onward, and still onward, the work will advance, until the whole earth shall have been warned. And then
          shall the end <nobr>come.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 22, 1906.</p>
