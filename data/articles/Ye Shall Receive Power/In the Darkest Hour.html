      <p><strong>And he said unto me, My grace is sufﬁcient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most
          gladly therefore will I rather glory in my inﬁrmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2
          Corinthians 12:9.</strong></p>
      <p>You may be disappointed, and your will and your way may be denied; but be assured that the Lord loves you. The
          furnace ﬁre may kindle upon you, not for the purpose of destroying you, but to consume the dross, that you may
          come forth as gold seven times puriﬁed. Bear in mind that God will give you songs in the night. Darkness may
          seem to enclose you, but you are not to look at the clouds. Beyond the darkest cloud there is an
          <nobr>ever-shining</nobr> light. The Lord has light for every soul. Open the door of the heart to hope, peace,
          and joy. Jesus says, “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy
          might be full” (John 15:11).</p>
      <p>God has a special work for everyone to do, and each one of us may do well the work which God has assigned him.
          The only thing we have to fear on our part is that we shall not keep our eyes continually ﬁxed upon Jesus,
          that we shall not have an eye single to the glory of God, so that if we were called to lay down our armor and
          sleep in death we might not be ready to give an account of our trust. Forget not for a moment that you are
          Christ’s property, bought with an inﬁnite price, and that you are to glorify Him in your spirit, and in your
          body, which are His....</p>
      <p>God has provided a balm for every wound. There is a Balm in Gilead, there is a Physician there. Will you not
          now as never before study the Scriptures? Seek the Lord for wisdom in every emergency. In every trial plead
          with Jesus to show you a way out of your troubles, then your eyes will be opened to behold the remedy and to
          apply to your case the healing promises that have been recorded in His Word. In this way the enemy will ﬁnd no
          place to lead you into mourning and unbelief, but instead you will have faith and hope and courage in the
          Lord. The Holy Spirit will give you clear discernment that you may see and appropriate every blessing that
          will act as an antidote to grief, as a branch of healing to every draught of bitterness that is placed to your
          <nobr>lips.—Selected</nobr> Messages <nobr>2:272-274.</nobr></p>
