    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
          perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. Philippians 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Transformation of character is to be the testimony to the world of the indwelling love of Christ. The Lord
          expects His people to show that the redeeming power of grace can work upon the faulty character and cause it
          to develop in symmetry and abundant fruitfulness.</p>
      <p>But in order for us to fulﬁll God’s purpose, there is a preparatory work to be done. The Lord bids us empty our
          hearts of the selﬁshness which is the root of alienation. He longs to pour upon us His Holy Spirit in rich
          measure, and He bids us clear the way by <nobr>self-renunciation.</nobr> When self is surrendered to God, our
          eyes will be opened to see the stumbling stones which our <nobr>un-Christlikeness</nobr> has placed in the way
          of others. All these God bids us remove. He says: “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
          another, that ye may be healed” (James 5:16). Then we may have the assurance that David had when, after
          confession of his sin, he prayed: “Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free
          spirit. Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee” (Psalm 51:12,
          13).</p>
      <p>When the grace of God reigns within, the soul will be surrounded with an atmosphere of faith and courage and
          Christlike love, an atmosphere invigorating to the spiritual life of all who inhale it.... Everyone who is
          a</p>
      <p>partaker of Christ’s pardoning love, everyone who has been enlightened by the Spirit of God and converted to
          the truth, will feel that for these precious blessings he owes a debt to every soul with whom he comes in
          contact. Those who are humble in heart the Lord will use to reach souls whom the ordained ministers cannot
          approach. They will be moved to speak words which reveal the saving grace of <nobr>Christ.—Testimonies</nobr>
          for the Church 6:43.</p>
