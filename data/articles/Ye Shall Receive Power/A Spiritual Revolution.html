    <h1>A Spiritual Revolution</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my
          Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.
          Philippians 3:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Through Christ, moral power is brought to man that will change the entire affections, and enable man to work
          with a will for the cause of God. Where all the power of mind and body was before concentrated to work the
          works of evil, by the Spirit of God a revolution is brought about. The Holy Spirit enlightens, renews, and
          sanctiﬁes the soul. Angels behold with inexpressible rapture the results of the working of the Holy Spirit in
          man.</p>
      <p>By the revelation of the attractive loveliness of Christ, by the knowledge of His love expressed to us while we
          were yet sinners, the stubborn heart is melted and subdued, and the sinner is transformed and becomes a child
          of God. Love is the agency which God uses to expel sin from the human soul. By it He changes pride into
          humility, enmity and unbelief into love and faith. He does not employ compulsory measures; Jesus is revealed
          to the soul, and if man will look in faith to the Lamb of God, he will live....</p>
      <p>Christ is presented to men that they may catch His temper, His perfection; and as the model is complete and
          perfect in every part, so, as man is conformed to the image of Christ, he is made complete in Him; for aside
          from Christ there never can be righteousness in the human heart.</p>
      <p>When the Spirit was poured out from on high, the church was ﬂooded with light, but Christ was that Light; the
          church was ﬁlled with joy, but Christ was the subject of that joy. When the Spirit is poured upon His people
          in this day, Christ’s name will be upon every tongue, His love will ﬁll every soul; and when the heart
          embraces Jesus, it will embrace God; for all the fullness of God dwells in Christ. When the beams of Christ’s
          righteousness shine upon the soul, joy, adoration, and glory will be woven with the
          <nobr>experience.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 9, 1890.</p>
