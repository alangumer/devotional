    <h1>Now Is the Time for Preparation</h1>

      <p><strong>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that
          shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. Luke 21:36.</strong></p>
      <p>Those professed believers who come up to the time of trouble unprepared, will, in their despair, confess their
          sins before the world in words of burning anguish, while the wicked exult over their distress. The case of all
          such is hopeless. When Christ stands up, and leaves the most holy place, the time of trouble commences, the
          case of every soul is decided, and there will be no atoning blood to cleanse from sin and pollution. As Jesus
          leaves the most holy, He speaks in tones of decision and kingly authority: “He that is unjust, let him be
          unjust still: and he which is ﬁlthy, let him be ﬁlthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
          still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to
          give every man according as his work shall be” (Revelation 22:11, 12).</p>
      <p>Those who have delayed a preparation for the day of God cannot obtain it in the time of trouble, or at any
          future period. The righteous will not cease their earnest, agonizing cries for deliverance. They cannot bring
          to mind any particular sins; but in their whole life they can see little good. Their sins have gone beforehand
          to judgment, and pardon has been written. Their sins have been borne away into the land of forgetfulness, and
          they cannot bring them to remembrance. Certain destruction threatens them, and, like Jacob, they will not
          suffer their faith to grow weak because their prayers are not immediately answered. Though suffering the pangs
          of hunger, they will not cease their intercessions. They lay hold of the strength of God, as Jacob laid hold
          of the angel; and the language of their soul is “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me” (Genesis
          32:26).</p>
      <p>That season of distress and anguish will require an effort of earnestness and determined faith that can endure
          delay and hunger, and will not fail under weakness, though severely tried. The period of probation is the time
          granted to all to prepare for the day of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, November 27, 1879.</p>
