    <h1>Deborah and Barak</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, Praise ye the Lord for the avenging
          of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves. Judges 5:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The Israelites, having again separated themselves from God by idolatry, were grievously oppressed by these
          enemies. The property and even the lives of the people were in constant danger. Hence the villages and lonely
          dwellings were deserted, and the people congregated in the walled cities. The high roads were unoccupied, and
          the people went from place to place by unfrequented byways. At the places for drawing water, many were robbed
          and even murdered, and to add to their distress, the Israelites were unarmed. Among forty thousand men, not a
          sword or a spear could be found.</p>
      <p>For twenty years, the Israelites groaned under the yoke of the oppressor; then they turned from their idolatry,
          and with humiliation and repentance cried unto the Lord for deliverance. They did not cry in vain. There was
          dwelling in Israel a woman illustrious for her piety, and through her the Lord chose to deliver His people.
          Her name was Deborah. She was known as a prophetess, and in the absence of the usual magistrates, the people
          had sought to her for counsel and justice.</p>
      <p>The Lord communicated to Deborah His purpose to destroy the enemies of Israel, and bade her send for a man
          named Barak, of the tribe of Naphtali, and make known to him the instructions which she had received. She
          accordingly sent for Barak, and directed him to assemble ten thousand men of the tribes of Naphtali and
          Zebulun, and make war upon the armies of King Jabin....</p>
      <p>Deborah celebrated the triumph of Israel in a most sublime and impassioned song. She ascribed to God all the
          glory of their deliverance, and bade the people praise Him for His wonderful <nobr>works.â€”The</nobr> Signs of
          the Times, June 16, 1881.</p>
