    <h1>Going House to House With The Gospel Worker</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to
          cure diseases. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And he said unto them,
          Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats
          apiece. And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. Luke
          <nobr>9:1-4.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The Lord is calling upon His people to take up different lines of missionary service. Those in the highways and
          byways of life are to hear the gospel message. Church members are to do evangelistic work in the homes of
          their neighbors who have not yet received full evidence of the truth for this time.</p>
      <p>Let those who take up this work make the life of Christ their constant study. Let them be intensely in earnest,
          using every capability in the Lord’s service. Precious results will follow sincere, unselﬁsh efforts. From the
          great Teacher the workers will receive the highest of all education. But those who do not impart the light
          they have received will one day realize that they have sustained a fearful loss.</p>
      <p>Many of God’s people are to go forth with our publications into places where the third angel’s message has
          never been proclaimed. The work of the <nobr>canvasser-evangelist</nobr> whose heart is imbued with the Holy
          Spirit is fraught with wonderful possibilities for good. The presentation of the truth, in love and
          simplicity, from house to house, is in harmony with the instruction that Christ gave His disciples when He
          sent them out on their ﬁrst missionary tour. By songs of praise, humble, heartfelt prayers, and a simple
          presentation of truth in the family circle, many will be reached. The divine Worker will be present to send
          conviction to hearts. “I am with you alway” (Matthew 28:20) is His promise. With the assurance of the abiding
          presence of such a Helper, we may labor with faith and hope and courage.</p>
      <p>The monotony of our service for God needs to be broken up. Every church member should be engaged in some
          special service for the Master. Let those who are well established in the truth go into neighboring places,
          and hold meetings. Let God’s Word be read, and let the ideas expressed be such that they will be readily
          comprehended by <nobr>all.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 5, 1904.</p>
