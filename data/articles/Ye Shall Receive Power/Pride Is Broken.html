    <h1>Pride Is Broken</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself
          more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure
          of faith. Romans 12:3.</strong></p>
      <p>The acceptance of truth is one of God’s means of sanctiﬁcation. The more clearly we understand the truth that
          He sends to us, and the more faithfully we obey it, the more humble shall we be in our own estimation, and the
          more exalted shall we be in the estimation of the heavenly universe. The more unselﬁsh our efforts for God,
          the more Christlike will be their inﬂuence, and the greater will be the good they will accomplish.</p>
      <p>There is a wide difference between the spirit of the world and the spirit of Christ. One leads to
          <nobr>self-seeking,</nobr> to striving for treasures that will be destroyed by the ﬁres of the last day; the
          other leads to <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> to striving for the treasures that
          never perish.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit, received by faith, breaks stubborn hearts. This is the soul and power of the sanctiﬁcation of
          the truth, the source of the faith that works by love and puriﬁes the heart. All true exaltation grows out of
          the humiliation developed in the life of Christ, shown by the wonderful sacriﬁce that He made to save
          perishing souls. He who is exalted by God must ﬁrst humble himself. God has exalted Christ above every name
          that is named. But Christ ﬁrst reached to the very depths of human woe, weaving Himself into the sympathies of
          the race by His meekness and gentleness. He has set an example that all who engage in His service are to
          follow.</p>
      <p>“Learn of me,” said the greatest Teacher that the world has ever known. “Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
          in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:29). It is not enough for us to read the Word of
          God. The Scriptures are given for our instruction, and we are to search them carefully and diligently. We are
          to study the Word of God, comparing one portion with another. Scripture is the key that unlocks scripture. As
          we read and study and pray, there is beside us a divine Teacher, the Holy Spirit, enlightening our
          understanding, that we may comprehend the great truths of God’s <nobr>Word.—Paciﬁc</nobr> Union Recorder,
          February 23, 1905.</p>
