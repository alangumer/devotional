      <p><strong>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest
          thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,
          as said the prophet Esaias. John 1:22, 23.</strong></p>
      <p>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist”
          (Matthew 11:11). In the announcement to Zacharias before the birth of John, the angel had declared, “He shall
          be great in the sight of the Lord” (Luke 1:15). In the estimation of Heaven, what is it that constitutes
          greatness? Not that which the world accounts greatness; not wealth, or rank, or noble descent, or intellectual
          gifts, in themselves considered. If intellectual greatness, apart from any higher consideration, is worthy of
          honor, then our homage is due to Satan, whose intellectual power no man has ever equaled. But when perverted
          to <nobr>self-serving,</nobr> the greater the gift, the greater curse it becomes.</p>
      <p>It is moral worth that God values. Love and purity are the attributes He prizes most. John was great in the
          sight of the Lord, when, before the messengers from the Sanhedrin, before the people, and before his own
          disciples, he refrained from seeking honor for himself, but pointed all to Jesus as the Promised One. His
          unselﬁsh joy in the ministry of Christ presents the highest type of nobility ever revealed in man.</p>
      <p>The witness borne of him after his death, by those who had heard his testimony to Jesus, was “John did no
          miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true” (John 10:41). It was not given to John to call
          down ﬁre from heaven, or to raise the dead, as Elijah did, nor to wield Moses’ rod of power in the name of
          God. He was sent to herald the Saviour’s advent, and to call upon the people to prepare for His coming. So
          faithfully did he fulﬁll his mission, that as the people recalled what he had taught them of Jesus, they could
          say, “All things that John spake of this man were true.” Such witness to Christ every disciple of the Master
          is called upon to <nobr>bear.—The</nobr> Desire of Ages, 219, 220.</p>
