    <h1>Developing Spiritual Discernment</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:
          neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. 1 Corinthians 2:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The jewels of truth lie scattered over the ﬁeld of revelation; but they have been buried beneath human
          traditions, beneath the sayings and commandments of men, and the wisdom from heaven has been practically
          ignored; for Satan has succeeded in making the world believe that the words and achievements of men are of
          great consequence. The Lord God, the Creator of the worlds, at inﬁnite cost has given the gospel to the world.
          Through this divine agent, glad, refreshing springs of heavenly comfort and abiding consolation have been
          opened for those who will come to the fountain of life. There are veins of truth yet to be discovered; but
          spiritual things are spiritually discerned.</p>
      <p>Minds beclouded with evil cannot appreciate the value of the truth as it is in Jesus. When iniquity is
          cherished, men do not feel the necessity of making diligent effort with prayer and reﬂection, to understand
          that they must know or lose heaven. They have so long been under the shadow of the enemy that they view truth
          as men behold objects through a smoked and imperfect glass; for all things are dark and perverted in their
          eyes. Their spiritual vision is feeble and untrustworthy; for they look upon the shadow, and turn away from
          the light.</p>
      <p>But those who profess to believe in Jesus should ever press to the light. They should daily pray for the light
          of the Holy Spirit to shine upon the pages of the sacred book, that they may be enabled to comprehend the
          things of the Spirit of God. We must have implicit trust in God’s Word, or we are lost. The words of men,
          however great they may be, are not able to make us perfect, to thoroughly furnish unto all good works.</p>
      <p>“God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit and belief of the
          truth” (2 Thessalonians 2:13). In this text the two agencies in the salvation of man are
          <nobr>revealed—the</nobr> divine inﬂuence, the strong, living faith of those who follow Christ. It is through
          the sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit and the belief of the truth that we become laborers together with
          <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 1, 1891.</p>
