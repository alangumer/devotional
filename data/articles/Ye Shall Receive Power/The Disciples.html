      <p><strong>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace
          was upon them all. Acts 4:33.</strong></p>
      <p>After the cruciﬁxion of Christ, the disciples were a helpless, discouraged <nobr>company—as</nobr> sheep
          without a shepherd. Their Master had been rejected, condemned, and nailed to the ignominious cross. Scornfully
          the Jewish priests and rulers had declared: “He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
          Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him” (Matthew 27:42).</p>
      <p>But the cross, that instrument of shame and torture, brought hope and salvation to the world. The disciples
          rallied; their hopelessness and helplessness left them. They were transformed in character, and united in
          bonds of Christian love. They were but humble men, without wealth, and with no weapon but the Word and Spirit
          of God, counted by the Jews as mere ﬁshermen. Yet in Christ’s strength they went forth to witness for the
          truth, and to triumph over all opposition. Clothed with the divine panoply, they went forth to tell the
          wonderful story of the manger and the cross. Without earthly honor or recognition, they were heroes of faith.
          From their lips came words of divine eloquence that shook the world.</p>
      <p>Those who had rejected and cruciﬁed the Saviour expected to ﬁnd the disciples discouraged and crestfallen,
          ready to disown their Lord. They heard with amazement the clear, bold testimony of the apostles, given under
          the power of the Holy Spirit. The disciples worked and spoke as their Master had worked and spoken, and all
          who heard them said, “They have been with Jesus, and learned of Him.”</p>
      <p>As the apostles went forth, preaching Jesus everywhere, they did many things that the Jewish rulers did not
          approve. The people brought their sick, and those vexed with unclean spirits, into the streets; crowds
          collected round them, and those who had been healed shouted the praises of God, and gloriﬁed the name of Him
          whom the Jews had condemned, crowned with thorns, and caused to be scourged and <nobr>cruciﬁed.—The</nobr>
          Signs of the Times, September 20, 1899.</p>
