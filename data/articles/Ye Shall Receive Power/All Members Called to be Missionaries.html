      <p><strong>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should
          shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter
          2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit, Christ’s representative, arms the weakest with might to press forward unto victory. God has
          organized His instrumentalities to draw all men unto Him. He sends forth to His work many who have not been
          dedicated by the laying on of hands. He answers objections that would arise against this method of labor, even
          before they arise. God sees the end from the beginning. He knows and anticipates every want, and provides for
          every emergency. If ﬁnite men to whom He commits His work do not bar the way, God will send forth laborers
          into His vineyard.</p>
      <p>To every converted soul He says: “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark
          16:15). It is not necessary that the Lord should ﬁrst sit in earthly legislative councils, and inquire of
          those who think they must plan for His work, “Will you permit men whom I have chosen, to unite with you in
          working in some part of My moral vineyard?” Christ was standing only a few steps from His heavenly throne when
          He gave His commission to His disciples, and included as missionaries all who would believe on His name.</p>
      <p>Jesus wants every minister to whom He has committed a sacred trust to remember His injunctions, to consider the
          vastness of His work, and to place the obligation of preaching the gospel to the world upon the large number
          to whom it belongs. “Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the
          third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,
          beginning at Jerusalem” (Luke 24:46, 47). The power of God was to go with those that proclaimed the gospel. If
          those who claim to have a living experience in the things of God had done their appointed duty as God
          ordained, the whole world would have been warned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to our world with power
          and great <nobr>glory.—The</nobr> Home Missionary, August 1, 1896.</p>
