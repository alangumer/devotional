      <p><strong>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
          and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and
          that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and
          that thou hide not thyself from thine own ﬂesh? Isaiah 58:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>Truth, precious truth, is sanctifying in its inﬂuence. The sanctiﬁcation of the soul by the operation of the
          Holy Spirit is the implanting of Christ’s nature in humanity. It is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
          revealed in character, and the grace of Christ brought into active exercise in good works. Thus the character
          is transformed more and more perfectly after the image of Christ in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
      <p>There are broad requirements in divine truth stretching out into one line after another of good works. The
          truths of the gospel are not unconnected; uniting they form one string of heavenly jewels, as in the personal
          work of Christ, and like threads of gold they run through the whole of Christian work and
          <nobr>experience.—Selected</nobr> Messages 3:198.</p>
      <p>Any neglect on the part of those who claim to be followers of Christ, a failure to relieve the necessities of a
          brother or sister who is bearing the yoke of poverty and oppression, is registered in the books of heaven as
          shown to Christ in the person of His saints. What a reckoning the Lord will have with many, very many, who
          present the words of Christ to others but fail to manifest tender sympathy and regard for a brother in the
          faith who is less fortunate and successful than <nobr>themselves.—Welfare</nobr> Ministry, 210.</p>
      <p>Many will allow a brother to struggle along unaided under adverse circumstances, and in thus doing they give to
          one precious soul the impression that they are thus representing Christ. It is no such thing; Jesus, who was
          rich, for our sake became poor, that we through His poverty might be rich. That He might save the sinner, He
          withheld not His own life. The heart of Christ is ever touched with human <nobr>woe.—The</nobr> Ellen G. White
          1888 Materials, 1270.</p>
