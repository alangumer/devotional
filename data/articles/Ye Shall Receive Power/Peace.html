    <h1>Peace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
          requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
          and minds through Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>The world’s Redeemer sought to bring to the hearts of the sorrowing disciples the strongest solace. But from a
          large ﬁeld of subjects, He chose the theme of the Holy Spirit, which was to inspire and comfort their hearts.
          And yet, though Christ made much of this theme concerning the Holy Spirit, how little is it dwelt upon in the
          churches! The name and presence of the Holy Spirit are almost ignored, yet the divine inﬂuence is essential in
          the work of perfecting the Christian character.</p>
      <p>Some are not at peace, not at rest; they are in a state of constant fretfulness, and permit impulse and passion
          to rule their hearts. They know not what it means to experience peace and rest in Christ. They are as a ship
          without anchor, driven with the wind and tossed. But those whose minds are controlled by the Holy Spirit walk
          in humility and meekness; for they work in Christ’s lines, and will be kept in perfect peace, while those who
          are not controlled by the Holy Spirit are like the restless sea.</p>
      <p>The Lord has given us a divine directory by which we may know His will. Those who are
          <nobr>self-centered,</nobr><nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr> do not feel their need of searching the Bible, and
          they are greatly disturbed if others do not have the same defective ideas, and see with the same distorted
          vision that they do. But he who is guided by the Holy Spirit has cast his anchor within the veil wherein Jesus
          has entered for us. He searches the Scriptures with eager earnestness, and seeks for light and knowledge to
          guide him amid the perplexities and perils which at every step compass his path. Those who are restless,
          complaining, murmuring, read the Bible for the purpose of vindicating their own course of action, and they
          ignore or pervert the counsels of God. He who has peace has placed his will on the side of God’s will, and
          longs to follow the divine <nobr>guidance.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 14, 1893.</p>
