    <h1>Faith That Works</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson,
          and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
          righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of ﬁre, escaped the edge
          of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in ﬁght, turned to ﬂight the armies of the
          aliens. Hebrews <nobr>11:32-34.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Faith is trusting <nobr>God—believing</nobr> that He loves us and knows best what is for our good. Thus,
          instead of our own, it leads us to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place
          of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are
          already His; faith acknowledges His ownership and accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, have been
          pointed out as secrets of life’s success. It is faith that puts us in possession of these principles.</p>
      <p>Every good impulse or aspiration is the gift of God; faith receives from God the life that alone can produce
          true growth and efﬁciency.</p>
      <p>How to exercise faith should be made very plain. To every promise of God there are conditions. If we are
          willing to do His will, all His strength is ours. Whatever gift He promises is in the promise itself. “The
          seed is the word of God” (Luke 8:11). As surely as the oak is in the acorn, so surely is the gift of God in
          His promise. If we receive the promise, we have the gift.</p>
      <p>Faith that enables us to receive God’s gifts is itself a gift, of which some measure is imparted to every human
          being. It grows as exercised in appropriating the Word of God. In order to strengthen faith, we must often
          bring it in contact with the Word.</p>
      <p>In the study of the Bible the student should be led to see the power of God’s word. In the creation, “He spake,
          and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.” He “calleth those things which be not as though they were”
          (Psalm 33:9; Romans 4:17); for when He calls them, they <nobr>are.—Education,</nobr> 253, 254.</p>
