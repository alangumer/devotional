    <h1>To Meet Fanaticism</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Again and again in past years I have been bidden to speak in protest against the fanciful and forbidden schemes
          that have been presented by one and another. My message has ever been, Preach the Word in simplicity and all
          humility; present clear, unadulterated truth to the people. Open no door to fanatical movements, for the
          inﬂuence of these is to bring confusion of mind and discouragement and lack of faith to God’s people....</p>
      <p>Whenever I have been called to meet fanaticism in its varied forms, I have received clear, positive, and
          deﬁnite instruction to lift my voice against its inﬂuence. With some the evil has revealed itself in the form
          of <nobr>man-made</nobr> tests for ascertaining a knowledge of the will of God; and I was shown that this was
          a delusion which became an infatuation, and that it is contrary to the will of the Lord. If we follow such
          methods, we shall be found aiding the enemy’s plans. In times past certain among the believers had great faith
          in the setting of signs by which to decide their duty. Some had such conﬁdence in these signs that men went so
          far as to exchange wives, thus bringing adultery into the church.</p>
      <p>I have been shown that deceptions like those we were called to meet in the early experiences of the message
          would be repeated, and that we shall have to meet them again in the closing days of the work. At this time we
          are required to bring all our powers under the control of God, exercising our faculties in accordance with the
          light He has given. Read the fourth and ﬁfth chapters of Matthew. Study Matthew <nobr>4:8-10;</nobr> also
          chapter 5:13. Meditate upon the sacred work that was carried forward by Christ. It is thus that the principles
          of the Word of God are to be brought into our <nobr>labors.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:28, 29.</p>
