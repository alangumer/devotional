      <p><strong>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when
          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is soon coming in the clouds of heaven, and we must be prepared to meet Him, not having spot or wrinkle
          or any such thing. We are now to accept the invitation of Christ. He says, “Come unto me, all ye that labour
          and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
          in heart; and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls” (Matthew 11:28, 29). The words of Christ to Nicodemus are of
          practical value to us today: “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
          kingdom of God. That which is born of the ﬂesh is ﬂesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel
          not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
          sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the
          Spirit” (John <nobr>3:5-8).</nobr></p>
      <p>The converting power of God must be upon our hearts. We must study the life of Christ, and imitate the divine
          Pattern. We must dwell upon the perfection of His character, and be changed into His image. No one will enter
          the kingdom of God unless his passions are subdued, unless his will is brought into captivity to the will of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>Heaven is free from all sin, from all deﬁlement and impurity; and if we would live in its atmosphere, if we
          would behold the glory of Christ, we must be pure in heart, perfect in character through His grace and
          righteousness. We must not be taken up with pleasure and amusement, but be ﬁtting up for the glorious mansions
          Christ has gone to prepare for us. If we are faithful, seeking to bless others, patient in
          <nobr>well-doing,</nobr> at His coming Christ will crown us with glory, honor, and
          <nobr>immortality.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 28, 1891.</p>
