    <h1>God’s Plans for the Work of the Church: Educational Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
          Proverbs 9:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The true object of education is to ﬁt men and women for service by developing and bringing into active exercise
          all their faculties. The work at our colleges and training schools should be strengthened year by year, for in
          them our youth are to be prepared to go forth to serve the Lord as efﬁcient laborers. The Lord calls upon the
          youth to enter our schools and quickly ﬁt themselves for active work. Time is short. Workers for Christ are
          needed everywhere. Urgent inducements should be held out to those who ought now to be engaged in earnest
          effort for the Master.</p>
      <p>Our schools have been established by the Lord; and if they are conducted in harmony with His purpose, the youth
          sent to them will be quickly prepared to engage in various branches of missionary work. Some will be trained
          to enter the ﬁeld as missionary nurses, some as canvassers, some as evangelists, and some as gospel ministers.
          Some are to be prepared to take charge of church schools, in which the children shall be taught the ﬁrst
          principles of education. This is a very important work, demanding high ability and careful study.</p>
      <p>Satan is trying to lead men and women away from right principles. The enemy of all good, he desires to see
          human beings so trained that they will exert their inﬂuence on the side of error, instead of using their
          talents to bless their fellow men. And multitudes who profess to belong to God’s true church are falling under
          his deceptions. They are being led to turn away from their allegiance to the King of heaven....</p>
      <p>It is to fortify the youth against the temptations of the enemy that we have established schools where they may
          be qualiﬁed for usefulness in this life and for the service of God throughout eternity. Those who have an eye
          single to God’s glory will earnestly desire to ﬁt themselves for special service; for the love of Christ will
          have a controlling inﬂuence upon them. This love imparts more than ﬁnite energy, and qualiﬁes human beings for
          divine <nobr>achievement.—Counsels</nobr> to Parents and Teachers, <nobr>493-495.</nobr></p>
