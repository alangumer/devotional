      <p><strong>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
          Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. John 16:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The Comforter is called “the Spirit of truth.” His work is to deﬁne and maintain the truth. He ﬁrst dwells in
          the heart as the Spirit of truth, and thus He becomes the Comforter. There is comfort and peace in the truth,
          but no real peace or comfort can be found in falsehood. It is through false theories and traditions that Satan
          gains his power over the mind. By directing men to false standards, he misshapes the character. Through the
          Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He exposes error, and
          expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth, working through the Word of God, that Christ subdues
          His chosen people to Himself.</p>
      <p>In describing to His disciples the ofﬁce work of the Holy Spirit, Jesus sought to inspire them with the joy and
          hope that inspired His own heart. He rejoiced because of the abundant help He had provided for His church. The
          Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His
          people. The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacriﬁce of Christ would have
          been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this
          satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the third
          person of the Godhead, who would come with no modiﬁed energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the
          Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world’s Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the
          heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given
          His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His
          own character on His <nobr>church.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 19, 1908.</p>
