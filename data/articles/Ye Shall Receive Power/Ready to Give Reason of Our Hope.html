    <h1>Ready to Give Reason of Our Hope</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready to give an answer to every man that asketh you a
          reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. 1 Peter 3:15.</strong></p>
      <p>This is what we shall see if we are connected with God. God wants us to depend upon Him, and not upon man. He
          desires us to have a new heart; He would give us revealings of light from the throne of God. We should wrestle
          with every difﬁculty, but when some controverted point is presented, are you to go to man to ﬁnd out his
          opinion, and then shape your conclusions from his? No, go to God. Tell Him what you want; take your Bible and
          search as for hidden treasures.</p>
      <p>We do not go deep enough in our search for truth. Every soul who believes present truth will be brought where
          he will be required to give a reason of the hope that is in him. The people of God will be called upon to
          stand before kings, princes, rulers, and great men of the earth, and they must know that they do know what is
          truth. They must be converted men and women. God can teach you more in one moment by His Holy Spirit than you
          could learn from the great men of the earth. The universe is looking upon the controversy that is going on
          upon the earth. At an inﬁnite cost, God has provided for every man an opportunity to know that which will make
          him wise unto salvation. How eagerly do angels look to see who will avail himself of this opportunity!</p>
      <p>When a message is presented to God’s people, they should not rise up in opposition to it; they should go to the
          Bible, comparing it with the law and the testimony, and if it does not bear this test, it is not true. God
          wants our minds to expand. He desires to put His grace upon us. We may have a feast of good things every day;
          for God can open the whole treasure of heaven to us. We are to be one with Christ as He is one with the
          Father, and the Father will love us as He loves His Son. We may have the same help that Christ had, we may
          have strength for every emergency; for God will be our front guard and our <nobr>rearward.—Selected</nobr>
