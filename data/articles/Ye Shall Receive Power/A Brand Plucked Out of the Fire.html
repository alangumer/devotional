    <h1>A Brand Plucked Out of the Fire</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem
          rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the ﬁre? Zechariah 3:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus speaks of His people as a brand plucked out of the ﬁre, and Satan understands what this means. The
          inﬁnite sufferings of the Son of God in Gethsemane and on Calvary were endured that He might rescue His people
          from the power of the evil one. The work of Jesus for the salvation of perishing souls is as if He thrust His
          hand into the ﬁre to save them. Joshua, who represents God’s people, is clothed in ﬁlthy garments, and stands
          before the angel; but as the people repent before God for the transgression of His law, and reach up by the
          hand of faith to lay hold on the righteousness of Christ, Jesus says, “Take away the ﬁlthy garments from them,
          and clothe them with change of raiment” (see Zechariah 3:4).</p>
      <p>It is through Christ’s righteousness alone that we are enabled to keep the law. Those who worship God in
          sincerity and truth, and afﬂict their souls before Him as in the great day of atonement, will wash their robes
          of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Satan seeks to bind about the human mind with
          deception, so that men will not repent and believe, that they may have their ﬁlthy garments removed. Why will
          you cling to your miserable defects of character, and by so doing bar the way, that Jesus may not work in your
          behalf?</p>
      <p>During the time of trouble, the position of God’s people will be similar to the position of Joshua. They will
          not be ignorant of the work going on in heaven in their behalf. They will realize that sin is recorded against
          their names, but they will also know that the sins of all who repent and lay hold of the merits of Christ will
          be canceled.... Those who have manifested true repentance for sin, and by living faith in Christ are obedient
          to</p>
      <p>God’s commandments, will have their names retained in the book of life, and they will be confessed before the
          Father and before the holy angels. Jesus will say, “They are mine; I have purchased them with my own
          <nobr>blood.”—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 2, 1890.</p>
