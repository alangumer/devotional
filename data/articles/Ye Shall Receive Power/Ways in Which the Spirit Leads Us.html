    <h1>Ways in Which the Spirit Leads Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. John 10:27.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus expects all who claim to be His soldiers to do service for Him. He expects you to recognize the enemy and
          to resist him, not to invite him to your conﬁdence and thus betray sacred trust. The Lord has placed you in a
          position where you may be elevated and ennobled, and be constantly gaining ﬁtness for His work. If you do not
          obtain these qualiﬁcations; you alone are to blame.</p>
      <p>There are three ways in which the Lord reveals His will to us, to guide us, and to ﬁt us to guide others. How
          may we know His voice from that of a stranger? How shall we distinguish it from the voice of a false shepherd?
          God reveals His will to us in His Word, the Holy Scriptures. His voice is also revealed in His providential
          workings; and it will be recognized if we do not separate our souls from Him by walking in our own ways, doing
          according to our own wills, and following the promptings of an unsanctiﬁed heart, until the senses have become
          so confused that eternal things are not discerned, and the voice of Satan is so disguised that it is accepted
          as the voice of God.</p>
      <p>Another way in which God’s voice is heard is through the appeals of His Holy Spirit, making impressions upon
          the heart, which will be wrought out in the character. If you are in doubt upon any subject, you must ﬁrst
          consult the Scriptures. If you have truly begun the life of faith, you have given yourself to the Lord to be
          wholly His, and He has taken you to mold and fashion according to His purpose, that you may be a vessel unto
          honor. You should have an earnest desire to be pliable in His hands and to follow whithersoever He may lead
          you. You are then trusting him to work out His designs, while at the same time you are cooperating with Him by
          working out your own salvation with fear and trembling. You, my brother, will ﬁnd difﬁculty here because you
          have not yet learned by experience to know the voice of the Good Shepherd, and this places you in doubt and
          peril. You ought to be able to distinguish His <nobr>voice.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 5:511, 512.</p>
