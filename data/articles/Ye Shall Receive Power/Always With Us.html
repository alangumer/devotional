      <p><strong>Always With Us</strong></p>
      <p>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. John 14:18.</p>
      <p>Christ desired His disciples to understand that He would not leave them orphans. “I will not leave you
          comfortless,” He declared; “I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
          me: because I live, ye shall live also” (John 14:18, 19). Precious, glorious assurance of eternal life! Even
          though He was to be absent, their relation to Him was to be that of a child to its parent.</p>
      <p>“At that day,” He said, “ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you” (John 14:20). He
          sought to impress the minds of the disciples with the distinction between those who are of the world and those
          who are of Christ. He was about to die, but He desired them to realize that He would live again. And although,
          after His ascension, He would be absent from them, yet by faith they might see and know Him, and He would have
          the same loving interest in them that He had while with them....</p>
      <p>The words spoken to the disciples come to us through their words. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs, at
          all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afﬂiction, when the outlook seems dark and the future
          perplexing, and we feel helpless and alone. These are times when the Comforter will be sent in answer to the
          prayer of faith.</p>
      <p>There is no comforter like Christ, so tender and so true. He is touched with the feeling of our inﬁrmities. His
          Spirit speaks to the heart. Circumstances may separate us from our friends; the broad, restless ocean may roll
          between us and them. Though their sincere friendship may still exist, they may be unable to demonstrate it by
          doing for us that which would be gratefully received. But no circumstances, no distance, can separate us from
          the heavenly Comforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is always there, one given in Christ’s place,
          to act in His stead. He is always at our right hand, to speak soothing, gentle words; to support, sustain,
          uphold, and cheer.</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. This Spirit works in and through everyone
          who receives Christ. Those who know the indwelling of this Spirit reveal its <nobr>fruit—love,</nobr> joy,
          peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, <nobr>faith.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 26, 1897.</p>
