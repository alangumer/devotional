    <h1>Human Work Made Effective by the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your
          heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? Luke 11:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit is not comprehended as it should be; the privileges to be enjoyed
          through its acceptance are not appreciated as they might be. God desires that His church should lay hold by
          faith upon His promises, and ask for the power of the Holy Spirit to help them in every place. He assures us
          that He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those that ask Him, than parents are to give good gifts
          unto their children. Since it is possible for everyone to have the heavenly unction, “ye need not that any man
          teach you” (1 John 2:27), and there is no excuse for shunning responsibilities; no duty should be unwelcome,
          no obligation evaded. Christ Himself is the renewing power, working in and through every soldier by the agency
          of the Holy Spirit. The efﬁciency of the Spirit of God will make effective the labors of all who are willing
          to submit to His guidance.</p>
      <p>God is moving upon every mind that is open to receive the impressions of His Holy Spirit. He is sending out
          messengers that they may give the warnings in every locality. God is testing the devotion of His churches, and
          their willingness to render obedience to the Spirit’s guidance. Knowledge is to be increased. The messengers
          of heaven are to be seen running to and fro, seeking in every way possible to warn the people of the coming
          judgments, and presenting the glad tidings of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. The standard of
          righteousness is to be exalted.</p>
      <p>The Spirit of God is moving upon men’s hearts, and those who respond to His inﬂuence will become lights in the
          world. Everywhere they are seen going forth to communicate to others the light they have received, as they did
          after the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. And as they let their light shine they receive
          more and more of the Spirit’s power. The earth is lighted with the glory of <nobr>God.—(Australasian)</nobr>
