      <p><strong>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
          fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. John 15:5.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord desires to make man the repository of divine inﬂuence, and the only thing that hinders the
          accomplishment of God’s designs is that men close their hearts to the Light of life. Apostasy caused the
          withdrawal of the Holy Spirit from man, but through the plan of redemption this blessing of heaven is to be
          restored to those who sincerely desire it. The Lord has promised to give all good things to those who ask Him,
          and all good things are deﬁned as given with the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>The more we discover our real need, our real poverty, the more will we desire the gift of the Holy Spirit; our
          souls will be turned, not into the channel of ambition and presumption, but into the channel of earnest
          supplication for the enlightenment of heaven. It is because we do not see our need, do not realize our
          poverty, that we do not pour forth earnest entreaties, looking unto Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of our
          faith, for the bestowal of the blessing....</p>
      <p>Jesus has said, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall be opened unto
          you” (Matthew 7:7). It is in proportion to our appreciation of the necessity and value of spiritual things
          that we seek for their attainment. “Without me ye can do nothing,” says Jesus, and yet many think that man can
          do very much in his own ﬁnite strength and wisdom. Satan is ready to offer his counsel that he may win souls
          in the game of life.</p>
      <p>When men do not feel the need of counseling with their brethren, something is wrong; they trust to their
          wisdom. It is essential that brethren should counsel together. This I have been compelled to urge for the last
          <nobr>forty-ﬁve</nobr> years. Again and again the instruction has been repeated that those who are engaged in
          important work in the cause of God should not walk in their own ideas, but counsel
          <nobr>together.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 2:333.</p>
