    <h1>The Gift of Tongues: Fluency in Foreign Languages</h1>

      <p><strong>And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this
          was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak
          in his own language. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these
          which speak Galileans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Acts
          <nobr>2:5-8.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>“And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of ﬁre, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all
          ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance” (Acts
          2:3, 4). The Holy Spirit, assuming the form of tongues of ﬁre, rested upon those assembled. This was an emblem
          of the gift then bestowed on the disciples, which enabled them to speak with ﬂuency languages with which they
          had heretofore been unacquainted. The appearance of ﬁre signiﬁed the fervent zeal with which the apostles
          would labor and the power that would attend their work.</p>
      <p>“There were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven” (verse 5). During the
          dispersion the Jews had been scattered to almost every part of the inhabited world, and in their exile they
          had learned to speak various languages. Many of these Jews were on this occasion in Jerusalem, attending the
          religious festivals then in progress. Every known tongue was represented by those assembled. This diversity of
          languages would have been a great hindrance to the proclamation of the gospel; God therefore in a miraculous
          manner supplied the deﬁciency of the apostles. The Holy Spirit did for them that which they could not have
          accomplished for themselves in a lifetime. They could now proclaim the truths of the gospel abroad, speaking
          with accuracy the languages of those for whom they were laboring.</p>
      <p>This miraculous gift was a strong evidence to the world that their commission bore the signet of Heaven. From
          this time forth the language of the disciples was pure, simple, and accurate, whether they spoke in their
          native tongue or in a foreign <nobr>language.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 39, 40.</p>
