      <p><strong>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s
          house, more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there
          enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be
          destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? Esther 4:13,
          14.</strong></p>
      <p>In ancient times the Lord worked in a wonderful way through consecrated women who united in His work with men
          whom He had chosen to stand as His representatives. He used women to gain great and decisive victories. More
          than once, in times of emergency, He brought them to the front and worked through them for the salvation of
          many lives. Through Esther the queen, the Lord accomplished a mighty deliverance for His people. At a time
          when it seemed that no power could save them, Esther and the women associated with her, by fasting and prayer
          and prompt action, met the issue, and brought salvation to their people.</p>
      <p>A study of women’s work in connection with the cause of God in Old Testament times will teach us lessons that
          will enable us to meet emergencies in the work today. We may not be brought into such a critical and prominent
          place as were the people of God in the time of Esther; but often converted women can act an important part in
          more humble positions. This many have been doing, and are still ready to do. It is a woman’s duty to unite
          with her husband in the disciplining and training of her sons and daughters, that they may be converted, and
          their powers consecrated to the service of God. There are many who have ability to stand with their husbands
          in sanitarium work, to give treatments to the sick and to speak words of counsel and encouragement to others.
          There are those who should seek an education that will ﬁt them to act the part of
          <nobr>physicians.—Special</nobr> Testimonies, Series B, No. 15, pp. 1, 2.</p>
