    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this
          woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. Acts 9:36.</strong></p>
      <p>At Joppa, which was near Lydda, there lived a woman named Dorcas, whose good deeds had made her greatly
          beloved.... Her life was ﬁlled with acts of kindness. Her skillful ﬁngers were more active than her</p>
      <p>tongue. She knew who needed comfortable clothing and who needed sympathy, and she freely ministered to the poor
          and the sorrowful.</p>
      <p>“And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died” (Acts 9:37). The church in Joppa realized
          their loss. And in view of the life of service that Dorcas had lived, it is little wonder that they mourned,
          or that warm teardrops fell upon the inanimate clay.</p>
      <p>Hearing that Peter was at Lydda, the believers in Joppa sent messengers to him, “desiring him that he would not
          delay to come to them” (verse 38).</p>
      <p>“Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the
          widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them”
          (verse 39).</p>
      <p>Peter directed that the weeping friends be sent from the room, and then kneeling down, he prayed fervently to
          God to restore Dorcas to life and health. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, arise. And she opened her
          eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up” (verse 40).</p>
      <p>Dorcas was of great service to the church, and God saw ﬁt to bring her back from the land of the enemy, that
          her skill and energy might still be a blessing to others, and that by this manifestation of His power, the
          cause of Christ might be <nobr>strengthened.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 6, 1911.</p>
