    <h1>Dispelling Darkness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the
          darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his
          glory shall be seen upon thee. Isaiah 60:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The church has been appointed as the medium through which divine light is to shine into the moral darkness of
          this world, and the <nobr>peace-giving</nobr> beams of the Sun of righteousness fall upon the hearts of men.
          Personal labor with individuals and with families constitutes a part of the work to be done in God’s moral
          vineyard. The meekness, the patience, the forbearance, the love of Christ must be revealed in the homes of the
          land. The church must arise and shine. Radiant with the Spirit and power of the truth, the people of God must
          go forth to a world lying in darkness, to make manifest the light of the glory of God. God has given to men
          noble powers of mind to be employed to His honor; and in the missionary work these powers of mind are called
          into active exercise. Wise improvement and development of the gifts of God will be seen in His servants. Day
          by day there will be growth in the knowledge of Christ.</p>
      <p>He who once spake as never man spake, who wore the garb of humanity, is still the Great Teacher. As you follow
          in His footsteps, seeking the lost, angels will draw near, and through the illumination of the Spirit of God,
          greater knowledge will be obtained as to the best ways and means for accomplishing the work committed to your
          hands....</p>
      <p>Those who should have been the light of the world have shed forth but feeble and sickly beams. What is light?
          It is piety, goodness, truth, mercy, love; it is the revealing of the truth in the character and life. The
          gospel is dependent on the personal piety of its believers for its aggressive power, and God has made
          provision through the death of His beloved Son, that every soul may be thoroughly furnished unto every good
          work. Every soul is to be a bright and shining light, showing forth the praises of Him who has called us out
          of darkness into His marvelous <nobr>light.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 24, 1891.</p>
