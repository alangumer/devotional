    <h1>Neither Excitement Nor Sensationalism</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity,
          sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having
          no evil thing to say of you. Titus 2:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has a work for you to do, and if you listen to His voice, you will not be left in darkness. The
          Saviour says, “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). “And a stranger will
          they not follow, ... for they know not the voice of strangers” (verse 5). I am sure that the Lord is revealing
          to you the perfection and fullness of the atoning work, that your whole heart may be ﬁlled with love and
          thanksgiving, and that you may reveal to others that which the Lord is revealing to you. The image of Christ
          engraved upon the heart is reﬂected in character, in practical life, day by day, because we represent a
          personal Saviour.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is promised to all who will ask for it. When you search the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit is by
          your side, personating Jesus Christ. The truth is a living principle made to shine in precious clearness to
          the understanding, and then, oh, then, it is time to speak words from the living Christ. “We are labourers
          together with God” (1 Corinthians 3:9). Christ said to the woman of Samaria, “If thou knewest the gift of God,
          and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given
          thee living water.... A well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John <nobr>4:10-14).</nobr></p>
      <p>Those who have the outpouring of the gospel of Christ which comes from the heart imbued by His Holy Spirit will
          give light and comfort and hope to hearts that are hungering and thirsting for righteousness. It is not
          excitement we wish to create, but deep, earnest consideration, that those who hear shall do solid work, real,
          sound, genuine work that will be enduring as eternity. We hunger not for excitement, for the sensational; the
          less we have of this, the better. The calm, earnest reasoning from the Scriptures is precious and fruitful.
          Here is the secret of success, in preaching a living, personal Saviour in so simple and earnest a manner that
          the people may be able to lay hold by faith of the power of the Word of <nobr>Life.—The</nobr> Paulson
          Collection, 101, 102.</p>
