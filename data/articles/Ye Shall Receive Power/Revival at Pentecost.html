      <p><strong>Revival at Pentecost</strong></p>
      <p>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with
          one accord in Solomon’s porch. Acts 5:12.</p>
      <p>Christ has made provision that His church shall be a transformed body, illumined with the light of heaven,
          possessing the glory of Immanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual
          atmosphere of light and peace. There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes
          room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God.</p>
      <p>What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost? The glad tidings of a risen
          Saviour were carried to the utmost bounds of the inhabited world. The hearts of the disciples were surcharged
          with the benevolence so full, so deep, so <nobr>far-reaching,</nobr> that it impelled them to go to the ends
          of the earth, testifying, “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ”
          (Galatians 6:14). As they proclaimed the truth as it is in Jesus, hearts yielded to the power of the message.
          The church beheld converts ﬂocking to her from all directions. Backsliders were reconverted. Sinners united
          with Christians in seeking the Pearl of great price.</p>
      <p>Those who had been the bitterest opponents of the gospel became its champions. The prophecy was fulﬁlled, that
          the weak shall be “as David,” and the house of David “as the angel of the Lord.” Every Christian saw in his
          brother the divine similitude of love and benevolence. One interest prevailed. One subject of emulation
          swallowed up all others. The only ambition of the believers was to reveal the likeness of Christ’s character
          and to labor for the enlargement of His kingdom.</p>
      <p>Notice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity, when they were no longer striving for the
          highest place, that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had been put away. And
          the testimony borne of them after the Spirit had been given was the <nobr>same.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          April 30, 1908.</p>
