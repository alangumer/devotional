      <p><strong>Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit,
          even as ye are called in one hope of your calling. Ephesians 4:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit will work with the consecrated human instrument; for this is God’s purpose. God has opened a
          door between heaven and earth, which no power can close. He calls upon every human being to be pure, holy,
          sanctiﬁed, in order that the work for this time may be accomplished. When God’s people place themselves in
          proper relation to Him and to one another, there will be a full impartation of the Holy Spirit for the
          harmonious combination of the whole body.</p>
      <p>Nothing so manifestly weakens a church as disunion and strife. Nothing so wars against Christ and the truth as
          this spirit. “By their fruits ye shall know them” (Matthew 7:20). “Doth a fountain send forth at the same
          place sweet water and bitter? Can the ﬁg tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, ﬁgs? so can no
          fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew
          out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom” (James <nobr>3:11-13).</nobr></p>
      <p>“Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest
          that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men, and
          holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God;
          lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be deﬁled” (Hebrews
          <nobr>12:12-15).</nobr></p>
      <p>As long as we are in this world we must be linked with one another. Humanity is interlaced and interwoven with
          humanity. As Christians we are members one of another. The Lord has made us thus, and when disappointments
          come, we are not to think the worse of one another. We are individual members of the general body. In
          helplessness and disappointment we are ﬁghting the battles of life, and the Lord designs us, as His sons and
          daughters, whom He calls His friends, to help one another. This is to be a part of our practical Christian
          <nobr>work.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, February 7, 1900.</p>
