    <h1>Step by Step to Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so ﬁght I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my
          body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be
          a castaway. 1 Corinthians 9:26, 27.</strong></p>
      <p>God leads His people on step by step. The Christian life is a battle and a march. In this warfare there is no
          release; the effort must be continuous and persevering. It is by unceasing endeavor that we maintain the
          victory over the temptations of Satan. Christian integrity must be sought with resistless energy and
          maintained with a resolute ﬁxedness of purpose....</p>
      <p>There is a science of Christianity to be <nobr>mastered—a</nobr> science as much deeper, broader, higher than
          any human science as the heavens are higher than the earth. The mind is to be disciplined, educated, trained;
          for we are to do service for God in ways that are not in harmony with inborn inclination. There are hereditary
          and cultivated tendencies to evil that must be overcome. Often the training and education of a lifetime must
          be discarded, that one may become a learner in the school of Christ. Our hearts must be educated to become
          steadfast in God. We are to form habits of thought that will enable us to resist temptation. We must learn to
          look upward. The principles of the Word of <nobr>God—principles</nobr> that are as high as heaven, and that
          compass <nobr>eternity—we</nobr> are to understand in their bearing upon our daily life. Every act, every
          word, every thought, is to be in accord with these principles.</p>
      <p>The precious graces of the Holy Spirit are not developed in a moment. Courage, fortitude, meekness, faith,
          unwavering trust in God’s power to save, are acquired by the experience of years. By a life of holy endeavor
          and ﬁrm adherence to the right the children of God are to seal their destiny.</p>
      <p>We have no time to lose. We know not how soon our probation may close. Eternity stretches before us. The
          curtain is about to be lifted. Christ is soon to come. The angels of God are seeking to attract us from
          ourselves and from earthly things. Let them not labor in <nobr>vain.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 8:313,
          314.</p>
