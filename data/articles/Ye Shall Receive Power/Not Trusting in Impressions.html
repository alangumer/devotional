    <h1>Not Trusting in Impressions</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. I will delight myself in thy statutes:
          I will not forget thy word. Psalm 119:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>In His Word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be
          accepted as an authoritative, infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the
          revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. “Every scripture inspired of God is also proﬁtable for
          teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness: that the man of God may be
          complete, furnished completely unto every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17, RV).</p>
      <p>Yet the fact that God has revealed His will to men through His Word has not rendered needless the continued
          presence and guiding of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our Saviour, to open the
          Word to His servants, to illuminate and apply its teachings. And since it was the Spirit of God that inspired
          the Bible, it is impossible that the teaching of the Spirit should ever be contrary to that of the Word.</p>
      <p>The Spirit was not <nobr>given—nor</nobr> can it ever be <nobr>bestowed—to</nobr> supersede the Bible; for the
          Scriptures explicitly state that the Word of God is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be
          tested. Says the apostle John, “Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because
          many false prophets are gone out into the world” (1 John 4:1). And Isaiah declares, “To the law and to the
          testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isaiah
          8:20).</p>
      <p>Great reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy Spirit by the errors of a class that, claiming its
          enlightenment, profess to have no further need of guidance from the Word of God. They are governed by
          impressions which they regard as the voice of God in the soul. But the spirit that controls them is not the
          Spirit of God. This following of impressions, to the neglect of the Scriptures, can lead only to confusion, to
          deception and ruin. It serves only to further the designs of the evil one.</p>
      <p>Since the ministry of the Holy Spirit is of vital importance to the church of Christ, it is one of the devices
          of Satan, through the errors of extremists and fanatics, to cast contempt upon the work of the Spirit and
          cause the people of God to neglect this source of strength which our Lord Himself has
          <nobr>provided.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, vii.</p>
