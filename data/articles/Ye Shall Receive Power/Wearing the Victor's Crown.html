      <p><strong>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not
          be hurt of the second death. Revelation 2:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The words, “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches” are repeated after these
          promises, weighty with importance to the children of God. It is for our eternal interest to know and
          understand what the Spirit saith unto the churches, and we should search carefully for light and knowledge
          that we may not be in ignorance of what God has commanded and promised in His precious Word. We have souls to
          be saved or lost, and with the greatest earnestness we should inquire, “What shall I do in order to obtain
          eternal life?” At the best, life is but short, and it is necessary that we should live this short life in
          harmony with the law of God, which is the law of the universe. We must have ears to hear, and hearts to
          understand, what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
      <p>The angels of God attain unto no higher knowledge than to know the will of God; and it is their greatest
          delight to accomplish the perfect will of the heavenly Father. Fallen man has the privilege of becoming
          intelligent in regard to the will of God. While probationary time is granted us, we should put our faculties
          to the very highest use, that we may make of ourselves all that it is possible; and while we endeavor to reach
          a high standard of intelligence, we should feel our dependence upon God, for without His grace, our efforts
          cannot bring lasting beneﬁt. It is through the grace of Christ that we are to be overcomers; through the
          merits of His blood we are to be of that number whose names will not be blotted out of the book of life.</p>
      <p>Those who are ﬁnal overcomers will have the life that runs parallel with the life of God, and wear the crown of
          the victor. When such great and eternal reward awaits us, we should run the race with patience, looking unto
          Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of our <nobr>faith.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 15, 1891.</p>
