    <h1>Every Man, Woman, and Child Is Responsible</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And so he that had received ﬁve talents came and brought other ﬁve talents, saying, Lord, thou
          deliveredst unto me ﬁve talents: behold, I have gained beside them ﬁve talents more. His Lord said unto him,
          Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler
          over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Matthew 25:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>The parable of the talents should be a matter of the most careful and prayerful study; for it has a personal
          and individual application to every man, woman, and child possessed of the powers of reason. Your obligation
          and responsibility are in proportion to the talents God has bestowed upon you. There is not a follower of
          Christ but has some peculiar gift for the use of which he is accountable to God.</p>
      <p>Many have excused themselves from rendering their gift to the service of Christ, because others were possessed
          of superior endowments and advantages. The opinion has prevailed that only those who are especially talented
          are required to sanctify their abilities to the service of God. It has come to be understood that talents are
          given only to a certain favored class, to the exclusion of others who, of course, are not called upon to share
          in the toils or rewards. But it is not so represented in the parable. When the master of the house called his
          servants, he gave to every man his work.</p>
      <p>The whole family of God are included in the responsibility of using their Lord’s goods. Every individual, from
          the lowliest and most obscure to the greatest and most exalted, is a moral agent endowed with abilities for
          which he is accountable to God. To a greater or less degree, all are placed in charge of the talents of their
          Lord. The spiritual, mental, and physical ability, the inﬂuence, station, possessions, affections, sympathies,
          all are precious talents to be used in the cause of the Master for the salvation of souls for whom Christ
          died. How few appreciate these blessings! How few seek to improve their talent, and increase their usefulness
          in the world! The Master has given to every man his work. He has given to every man according to his ability,
          and his trust is in proportion to his capacity. God requires everyone to be a worker in His vineyard. You are
          to take up the work that has been placed in your charge, and to do it <nobr>faithfully.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, May 1, 1888.</p>
