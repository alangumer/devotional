    <h1>The Enemy Does Not Give Up Easily</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the
          sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short
          time. Revelation 12:12.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who consecrate their all to God will not be left unmolested by the enemy of souls. Satan will come to
          them with his specious temptations, designing to allure them from their loyalty to God. He will present to
          them his bribe, as he did to Christ in the wilderness of temptation, saying, “All these things will I give
          thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me” (Matthew 4:9).</p>
      <p>But what should be the answer of the Christian to all the temptations of the evil one? He should say, “I will
          not lend my inﬂuence in any way to the advancement of anything save the cause of Christ. I am not my own; I
          have been bought with a price. I am not to live to please myself; for I have been purchased, ransomed by the
          blood of Christ. It is not possible for me to give to Christ more than that which belongs to Him; for every
          moment of my life belongs to Him. I am His possession, a servant employed to do the will of my Master.”</p>
      <p>This is the only position that is safe for us to occupy; and if the individual members of the church felt in
          this way, what a power would the church exert to draw and win souls to Christ. It is this halfhearted work,
          the effort to serve God and the devil at the same time, that leaves the church so destitute of the Spirit of
          God.</p>
      <p>Were the members of the church consecrated to God, were they in the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace,
          were they organized for the purpose of imparting to others an inﬂuence of good, the church would be indeed the
          light of the world. Should the individual members seek to represent Christ to the world in character and life,
          thousands would be attracted to the Saviour, who now have reason to criticize the words and works of those who
          profess the name of Christ.</p>
      <p>“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
          knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that
          the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us” (2 Corinthians 4:6, <nobr>7).—Home</nobr>
