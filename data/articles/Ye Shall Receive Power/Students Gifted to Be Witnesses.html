    <h1>Students Gifted to Be Witnesses</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
          word of truth. 2 Timothy 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Let teachers and students watch for opportunities to confess Christ in their conversation. Such witness will be
          more effective than many sermons....</p>
      <p>Students, make your school life as perfect as possible. You will pass over the way but once, and precious are
          the opportunities granted you. You are not only to learn but to practice the lessons of Christ. While
          obtaining your education, you have the opportunity to tell of the wonderful truths of God’s Word. Improve
          every such opportunity. God will bless every minute spent in this way. Maintain your simplicity and your love
          for souls, and the Lord will lead you in safe paths. The rich experience you gain will be of more value to you
          than gold or silver or precious stones.</p>
      <p>You know not to what position you may be called in the future. God may use you as He used Daniel, to take the
          knowledge of the truth to the mighty of the earth. It rests with you to say whether you will have skill and
          knowledge to do this work. God can give you skill in all your learning. He can help you to adapt yourself to
          the line of study you take up. Make it your ﬁrst interest to gather up right, noble, uplifting principles. God
          desires you to witness for Him. He does not want you to stand still; He wants you to run in the way of His
          commandments.</p>
      <p>Christ desires to use every student as His agent. You are to cooperate with the One who gave His life for you.
          What rich blessings would come to our schools if teachers and students would consecrate themselves, heart,
          mind, soul, and strength, to God’s service as His helping hand! His helping <nobr>hand—that</nobr> is what you
          may be if you will yield yourselves to His keeping. He will lead you safely, and enable you to make straight
          paths for yourselves and for others. He will give you knowledge and wisdom, and a ﬁtness for fuller
          <nobr>service.—Counsels</nobr> to Parents and Teachers, 554, 555.</p>
