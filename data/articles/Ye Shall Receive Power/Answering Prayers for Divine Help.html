    <h1>Answering Prayers for Divine Help</h1>

      <p><strong>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them
          diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest
          by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>Fathers and mothers, how can I ﬁnd words to describe your great responsibility! By the character you reveal
          before your children you are educating them to serve God or to serve self. Then offer to heaven your earnest
          prayers for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that your hearts may be sanctiﬁed, and that the course you pursue may
          honor God and win your children to Christ. It should give to parents a sense of the solemnity and sacredness
          of their task, when they realize that by careless speech or action they may lead their children astray.</p>
      <p>Parents need the guardianship of God and His Word. If they do not heed the counsels of the Word of God, if they
          do not make the Bible the man of their counsel, the rule of their life, their children will grow careless and
          will walk in paths of disobedience and unbelief. Christ lived a life of toil and <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and
          died a death of shame, that He might give an example of the spirit that should inspire and control His
          followers. As in their home life parents strive to be Christlike, heavenly inﬂuences will be shed abroad in
          the lives of their family.</p>
      <p>In every Christian home God should be honored by the morning and evening sacriﬁces of praise and prayer. Every
          morning and evening earnest prayers should ascend to God for His blessing and guidance. Will the Lord of
          heaven pass by such homes, and leave no blessing there? Nay, verily. Angels hear the offering of praise and
          the prayer of faith, and they bear the petitions to Him who ministers in the sanctuary for His people, and
          pleads His merits in their behalf. True prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence, and gives men the victory. Upon
          his knees the Christian obtains strength to resist <nobr>temptation.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 1,
          1912.</p>
