    <h1>Zerubbabel and Zechariah</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that
          were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son
          of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and
          with them were the prophets of God helping them. Ezra 5:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>In rebuilding the house of the Lord, Zerubbabel had been encompassed with manifold difﬁculties. In former
          years, adversaries had “weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,” “and made
          them to cease by force and power” (Ezra 4:4, 23). But the Lord interposed in behalf of the faithful builders,
          and now He speaks through His prophet, Zechariah, to Zerubbabel, saying, “Not by might, nor by power, but by
          my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
          plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it” (Zechariah
          4:6, 7).</p>
      <p>Throughout the history of God’s people, great mountains of difﬁculty, apparently insurmountable, have loomed up
          before those who were advancing in the opening providences of God. Such obstacles to progress are permitted by
          the Lord as a test of faith. When [we are] hedged about on every side, this is the time above all others to
          trust in God and in the power of His Holy Spirit. We are not to walk in our own strength, but in the strength
          of the Lord God of Israel. It is folly to trust in man or to make ﬂesh our arm. We must trust in Jehovah; for
          in Him is everlasting strength. The One who, in response to words and deeds of faith, made the way plain
          before His servant Zerubbabel, is able to clear away every obstacle devised by Satan to hinder the progress of
          His cause. Through the exercise of persevering faith, every mountain of difﬁculty may be removed.</p>
      <p>Sometimes God trains His workers by bringing to them disappointment and apparent failure. It is His purpose
          that they shall learn to master difﬁculty. He seeks to inspire them with a determination to make every
          apparent failure prove a <nobr>success.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 16, 1908.</p>
