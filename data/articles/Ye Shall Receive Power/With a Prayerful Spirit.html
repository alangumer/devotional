      <p><strong>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. Psalm 119:18.</strong></p>
      <p>Many a portion of Scripture which learned men pronounce a mystery, or pass over as unimportant, is full of
          comfort and instruction to him who has been taught in the school of Christ. One reason why many theologians
          have no clearer understanding of God’s Word is [that] they close their eyes to truths which they do not wish
          to practice. An understanding of Bible truth depends not so much on the power of intellect brought to the
          search as on the singleness of purpose, the earnest longing after righteousness.</p>
      <p>The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of
          those things easy to be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difﬁcult of comprehension. It is the
          ofﬁce of heavenly angels to prepare the heart so to comprehend God’s Word that we shall be charmed with its
          beauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and strengthened by its promises. We should make the
          psalmist’s petition our own: “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law”.</p>
      <p>Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the
          tempted one cannot readily remember God’s promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are
          round about those who are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great necessity they will
          bring to their remembrance the very truths which are needed. Thus “when the enemy shall come in like a ﬂood,
          the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him” (Isaiah 59:19).</p>
      <p>Jesus promised His disciples: “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he
          shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you” (John
          14:26). But the teachings of Christ must previously have been stored in the mind in order for the Spirit of
          God to bring them to our remembrance in the time of peril. “Thy word have I hid in mine heart,” said David,
          “that I might not sin against thee” (Psalm <nobr>119:11).—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 599, 600.</p>
