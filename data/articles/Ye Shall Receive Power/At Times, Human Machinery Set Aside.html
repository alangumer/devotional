    <h1>At Times, Human Machinery Set Aside</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant
          men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. Acts 4:13.</strong></p>
      <p>If we will open the door to Jesus, He will come in and abide with us. Our strength will always be reinforced by
          His actual representative, the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>The truth is a living principle made to shine in precious clearness to the understanding, and then, oh, then,
          it is time to speak words from the living Christ. “We are labourers together with God” (1 Corinthians
          3:9).</p>
      <p>Under the showers of the latter rain, the inventions of man, the human machinery, will at times be swept away,
          the boundary of man’s authority will be as broken reeds, and the Holy Spirit will speak through the living,
          human agent with convincing power. No one will then watch to see if the sentences are well rounded off, if the
          grammar is faultless. The living water will ﬂow in God’s own channels.... I am sure that there is a</p>
      <p>heaven full of the richest, enduring treasures to be freely given to all who will appropriate them to
          themselves, and becoming enriched, thereby, will impart freely to others. I know this to be the truth.</p>
      <p>We need to obtain a rich, daily experience in prayer; we should be like the importunate widow, who, in her
          conscious need, overcame the unjust judge by the bare force of her determined pleadings. God will be inquired
          of to do these things for us; for this is giving depth and solidity to our experience. The soul that seeks God
          will need to be in earnest. He is a rewarder of all those that seek him diligently....</p>
      <p>We want the truth spoken to human hearts by men that have been baptized with holy love for Christ, and for the
          purchase of His blood, men who are themselves thoroughly impressed with the truth they are presenting to
          others; and who are practicing the same in their own <nobr>life.—The</nobr> General Conference Bulletin,
          February 15, 1895.</p>
