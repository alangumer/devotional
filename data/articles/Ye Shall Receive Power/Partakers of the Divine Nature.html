    <h1>Partakers of the Divine Nature</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of
          the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 2 Peter 1:4.</strong></p>
      <p>A healthy Christian is one who has Christ formed within, the hope of glory. He loves truth, purity, and
          holiness, and will manifest spiritual vitality, having love for the Word of God, and seeking communion with
          those who are acquainted with the Word, in order that he may catch every ray of light that God has
          communicated to them, which reveals Christ and makes Him more precious to the soul. He who has sound faith
          ﬁnds that Christ is the life of the soul, that He is in him as a well of water springing up unto everlasting
          life, and he delights to conform every power of the soul to the obedience of his Lord. The Holy Spirit with
          its vivifying inﬂuence ever keeps such a soul in the love of God.</p>
      <p>To the Christian it is written: “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of
          Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and
          godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us
          exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having
          escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your
          faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to
          patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these
          things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
          our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten
          that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
          election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you
          abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (2 Peter
          <nobr>1:2-11).—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 11, 1894.</p>
