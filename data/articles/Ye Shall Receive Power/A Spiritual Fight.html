    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A Spiritual Fight</strong></p>
      <p>For we wrestle not against ﬂesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of
          the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6:12.</p>
      <p>The Christian life is a warfare. But “we wrestle not against ﬂesh and blood, but against principalities,
          against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
          places.” In this conﬂict of righteousness against unrighteousness we can be successful only by divine aid. Our
          ﬁnite will must be brought into submission to the will of the Inﬁnite; the human will must be blended with the
          divine. This will bring the Holy Spirit to our aid; and every conquest will tend to the recovery of God’s
          purchased possession, to the restoration of His image in the soul.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus acts through the Holy Spirit; for it is His representative. Through it He infuses spiritual life
          into the soul, quickening its energies for good, cleansing it from moral deﬁlement, and giving it a ﬁtness for
          His kingdom. Jesus has large blessings to bestow, rich gifts to distribute among men. He is the wonderful
          Counselor, inﬁnite in wisdom and strength; and if we will acknowledge the power of His Spirit, and submit to
          be molded by it, we shall stand complete in Him. What a thought is this! In Christ “dwelleth all the fulness
          of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him” (Colossians 2:9, 10).</p>
      <p>Never will the human heart know happiness until it is submitted to be molded by the Spirit of God. The Spirit
          conforms the renewed soul to the model, Jesus Christ. Through the inﬂuence of the Spirit, enmity against God
          is changed into faith and love, and pride into humility. The soul perceives the beauty of truth, and Christ is
          honored in excellence and perfection of character. As these changes are effected, angels break out in
          rapturous song, and God and Christ rejoice over souls fashioned after the divine <nobr>similitude.—The</nobr>
          Review and Herald, February 10, 1903.</p>
