    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Go ye, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this
          book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have
          not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. 2
          Kings 22:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Josiah, from his earliest manhood, had endeavored to take advantage of his position as king to exalt the
          principles of God’s holy law. And now, while Shaphan the scribe was reading to him out of the book of the law,
          the king discerned in this volume a treasure of knowledge, a powerful ally, in the work of reform he so much
          desired to see wrought in the land. He resolved to walk in the light of its counsels, and also to do all in
          his power to acquaint his people with its teachings, and to lead them, if possible, to cultivate reverence and
          love for the law of heaven.</p>
      <p>But was it possible to bring about the needed reform? From all that he could learn from the reading of the
          volume before him, Israel had almost reached the limit of divine forbearance; soon God would arise to punish
          those who had brought dishonor upon His name. Already the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people.
          Overwhelmed with sorrow and dismay, Josiah rent his garments, and bowed before God in agony of spirit, seeking
          pardon for the sins of an impenitent nation.</p>
      <p>At that time the prophetess Huldah was living in Jerusalem, near the Temple. The mind of the king, ﬁlled with
          anxious foreboding, reverted to her; and he determined to inquire of the Lord through this chosen messenger,
          to learn, if possible, whether by any means within his power he might save erring Judah, now on the verge of
          ruin.</p>
      <p>The gravity of the situation, and the respect in which he held the prophetess, led him to choose as his
          messengers to her the ﬁrst men of the kingdom. “Go ye,” he bade them, “inquire of the Lord for me, and for the
          people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord
          that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do
          according unto all that which is written concerning <nobr>us.”—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 22,
          1915.</p>
