    <h1>March—Fruitful in the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A Holy Fragrance</strong></p>
      <p>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and
          that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. John
          15:16.</p>
      <p>In order to bear much fruit, we must make the most of our privileges and opportunities, becoming more and more
          spiritually minded. We must put away all commonness, all pride, all worldliness, and daily receive divine aid.
          If you grow spiritually, you must employ all the means which the gospel provides, and be prepared to gain in
          piety by the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit; for the seed is developed from blade to full corn by unseen and
          supernatural agencies.</p>
      <p>The promise with which Jesus consoled His disciples just before His betrayal and cruciﬁxion was that of the
          Holy Spirit; and in the doctrine of divine inﬂuence and agency, what riches were revealed to them; for this
          blessing would bring in its train all other blessings. The Holy Spirit breathes upon the soul who humbly rests
          in Christ as the author and ﬁnisher of his faith; and from such a believer fruit will come forth unto life
          eternal. His inﬂuence will be fragrant, and the name of Jesus will be music in his ears, and melody in his
          heart.</p>
      <p>The Christian will be a savor of life unto life to others, although he may not be able to explain the mysteries
          of his experience. But he will know that when clouds and darkness compassed him about, and he cried unto the
          Lord, the darkness was dispersed, and peace and joy were in the temple of the soul. He will know what it is to
          have the pardoning love of God revealed to the heart, to experience the peace that passeth all understanding,
          to have praise and thanksgiving and adoration welling up in the soul unto Him who has loved us, and washed us
          from our sins in His own blood. He has peace through Jesus Christ, and joy in the Holy Ghost. One with Christ,
          his soul is ﬁlled with submission to His will, and heaven is enshrined in his heart while he is enfolded in
          the bosom of inﬁnite love. Christians of this order will bear much fruit to the glory of God. They will
          rightly interpret the character of God, and manifest His attributes unto the <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Signs of
          the Times, April 3, 1893.</p>
