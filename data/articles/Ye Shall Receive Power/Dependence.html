    <h1>Dependence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may
          apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Philippians 3:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The experience of the Christian in his earliest love is full of simplicity and freshness; but as his
          opportunities multiply, his experience should enlarge, and his knowledge increase. He should become strong to
          bear responsibility, and his maturity should be in proportion to his privileges....</p>
      <p>But unless there is an hourly dependence upon Christ, increasing knowledge and privileges will result in
          <nobr>self-trust</nobr> and <nobr>self-righteousness.</nobr> The young Christian is in danger of forgetting
          that it is Christ that has begun the good work in him, and that it is Christ that must ﬁnish it. The soul must
          renounce all merit, and trust wholly in the merit of Him who is too wise to err. Man of himself can do no good
          thing. Said Jesus, “Without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5). The soul is to stay itself upon God.</p>
      <p>In the gift of Christ all heaven was poured out, and through Christ the Holy Spirit is promised to the
          believer. Jesus said to His disciples, “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in
          my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
          you” (John 14:26). Christ not only offers pardon to the believing, repenting soul, but He promises him the
          constant aid of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>In the growth of the seed in the soil, man cannot see the working of unseen agencies that develop the plant to
          perfection, bringing up ﬁrst the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. But though young in the
          faith, you may know that you have passed from death unto life, if the fruits of the Spirit are made manifest
          in your life. If you are growing in faith and hope and love, you may know that your spiritual vision has been
          cleared. If you delight to dwell upon the plan of salvation, upon the glorious manifestations of the divine
          character, if your heart, in contemplation of the love of God, glows with thankfulness and joy, you may be
          sure that you have been illuminated by the beams of the Holy Spirit, and heavenly agencies are bringing your
          character up to maturity of Christian <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, March 27, 1893.</p>
