    <h1>The Spirit May Depart</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the
          Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctiﬁed, an unholy thing, and hath
          done despite unto the Spirit of grace? Hebrews 10:29.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who resist the Spirit of God, and provoke Him to depart, know not to what lengths Satan will lead them.
          When the Holy Spirit departs from the man, he will imperceptibly do those things which once he viewed, in a
          correct light, to be decided sin. Unless he heeds the warnings, he will wrap himself in a deception that, as
          in the case of Judas, will cause him to become a traitor and blind. He will follow step by step in the
          footsteps of Satan. Who, then, can strive with him to any purpose? Will the ministers plead with him and for
          him? All their words are as idle tales. Such souls have Satan as their chosen companion, to misconstrue the
          word spoken, and bring it to their understanding in a perverted light.</p>
      <p>When the Spirit of God is grieved away, every appeal made through the Lord’s servants is meaningless to them.
          They will misconstrue every word. They will laugh at and turn into ridicule the most solemn words of Scripture
          warnings, which, if they were not bewitched by satanic agencies, would make them tremble. Every appeal made to
          them is in vain. They will not hear reproof or counsel. They despise all the entreaties of the Spirit, and
          disobey the commandments of God which they once vindicated and exalted. Well may the words of the apostle come
          home to such souls, “Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?” (Galatians 3:1). They follow
          the counsel of their own heart until truth is no more truth to them. Barabbas is chosen, Christ is
          rejected.</p>
      <p>It is essential to live by every word of God, else our old nature will constantly reassert itself. It is the
          Holy Spirit, the redeeming grace of truth in the soul, that makes the followers of Christ one with one
          another, and one with God. He alone can expel enmity, envy, and unbelief. He sanctiﬁes the entire affections.
          He restores the willing, desirous soul from the power of Satan unto God. This is the power of grace. It is a
          divine power. Under its inﬂuence there is a change from the old habits, customs, and practices which, when
          cherished, separate the soul from God; and the work of sanctiﬁcation goes on in the soul, constantly
          progressing and <nobr>enlarging.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 12, 1897.</p>
