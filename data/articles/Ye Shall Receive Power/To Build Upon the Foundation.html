    <h1>To Build Upon the Foundation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
          corner stone. Ephesians 2:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Let not any man enter upon the work of tearing down the foundations of the truth that have made us what we are.
          God has led His people forward step by step though there were pitfalls of error on every side. Under the
          wonderful guidance of a plain, “Thus saith the Lord,” a truth has been established that has stood the test of
          trial. When men arise and attempt to draw away disciples after them, meet them with the truths that have been
          tried as by ﬁre.</p>
      <p>“And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God,
          and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. Be watchful, and
          strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
          Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not
          watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee” (Revelation
          <nobr>3:1-3).</nobr></p>
      <p>Those who seek to remove the old landmarks are not holding fast; they are not remembering how they have
          received and heard. Those who try to bring in theories that would remove the pillars of our faith concerning
          the sanctuary or concerning the personality of God or of Christ are working as blind men. They are seeking to
          bring in uncertainties and to set the people of God adrift without an anchor.</p>
      <p>Those who claim to be identiﬁed with the message that God has given us should have keen, clear spiritual
          perceptions, that they may distinguish truth from error. The word spoken by the messenger of God is “Wake up
          the watchmen.” If men will discern the spirit of the messages given and strive to ﬁnd out from what source
          they come, the Lord God of Israel will guard them from being led <nobr>astray.—Manuscript</nobr> Release
