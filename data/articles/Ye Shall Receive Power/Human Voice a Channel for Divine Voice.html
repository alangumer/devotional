      <p><strong>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his
          mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. Exodus 4:15.</strong></p>
      <p>When he who is a colaborer with Christ presses home the truth to the sinner’s heart in humility and love, the
          voice of love speaks through the human instrumentality. Heavenly intelligences work with a consecrated human
          agent, and the Spirit operates upon the soul of the unbeliever. Efﬁciency to believe comes from God to the
          heart, and the sinner accepts the evidence of God’s Word.</p>
      <p>Through the gracious inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit he is changed and becomes one with Christ in spirit and
          purpose. His affection for God increases, he hungers after righteousness and longs to be more like his Master.
          By beholding Christ, he is changed from glory to glory, from character to character, and becomes more and more
          like Jesus. He is imbued with love for Christ and ﬁlled with a deep, unresting love for perishing souls, and
          Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. “As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
          of God, even to them that believe on his name” (John <nobr>1:12).—Testimonies</nobr> to Ministers and Gospel
          Workers, 220, 221.</p>
      <p>We need more of the working of the Inﬁnite and far less trust in human agencies. We are to prepare a people to
          stand in the day of God’s preparation; we are to call men’s attention to the cross of Calvary, to make clear
          the reason why Christ made His great sacriﬁce. We are to show men that it is possible for them to come back to
          their allegiance to God and to their obedience to His commandments. When the sinner looks upon Christ as the
          propitiation for his sins, let men step aside. Let them declare to the sinner that Christ “is the propitiation
          for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world” (1 John 2:2).</p>
      <p>Encourage him to seek wisdom from God; for through earnest prayer he will learn the way of the Lord more
          perfectly than if instructed by some human counselor. He will see that it was the transgression of the law
          that caused the death of the Son of the inﬁnite God, and he will hate the sins that wounded Jesus. As he looks
          upon Christ as a compassionate, tender High Priest, his heart will be preserved in
          <nobr>contrition.—Testimonies</nobr> to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 220.</p>
