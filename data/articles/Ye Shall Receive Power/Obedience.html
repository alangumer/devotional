    <h1>Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as
          he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation. 1 Peter 1:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>What does God require? Perfection, nothing less than perfection. But if we would be perfect, we must put no
          conﬁdence in self. Daily we must know and understand that self is not to be trusted. We need to grasp God’s
          promises with ﬁrm faith. We need to ask for the Holy Spirit with a full realization of our own helplessness.
          Then when the Holy Spirit works we shall not give self the glory. The Holy Spirit will graciously take the
          heart into His keeping, bringing to it all the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness. We shall be kept by
          the power of God through faith.</p>
      <p>When we are daily under the control of God’s Spirit, we shall be <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people. We
          may show to the world that obedience to God’s commands brings its own reward, even in this life, and in the
          future life eternal blessedness. Notwithstanding our profession of faith, the Lord, by whom our actions are
          weighed, sees but an imperfect representation of Christ. He has declared that such a condition of things
          cannot glorify Him.</p>
      <p>It means much to commit the keeping of the soul to God. It means that we are to live and walk by faith, not
          trusting in or glorifying self, but looking to Jesus our Advocate as the author and ﬁnisher of our faith. The
          Holy Spirit will do its work upon the heart that is contrite, but never can it work upon a
          <nobr>self-important,</nobr><nobr>self-righteous</nobr> soul. In his own wisdom such a one would mend himself.
          He interposes between his soul and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will work if self will not interpose.</p>
      <p>Where is our dependence? Where is our help? God’s Word tells us: “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
          the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
          whatsoever I have said unto you” (John 14:26). The Holy Spirit is ready to cooperate with all who will receive
          Him and be taught by Him. All who lay hold on the truth and are sanctiﬁed through the truth are so united with
          Christ that they can represent Him in word and <nobr>action.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 12:52, 53.</p>
