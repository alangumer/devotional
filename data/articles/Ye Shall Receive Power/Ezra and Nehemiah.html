    <h1>Ezra and Nehemiah</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to
          understand the reading. And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites
          that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor
          weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. Nehemiah 8:8, 9.</strong></p>
      <p>Nehemiah and Ezra are men of opportunity. The Lord had a special work for them to do. They were to call upon
          the people to consider their ways, and to see where they had made their mistake; for the Lord had not suffered
          His people to become powerless and confused and to be taken into captivity without a cause. The Lord
          especially blessed these men for standing up for the right. Nehemiah was not set apart as a priest or a
          prophet, but the Lord used him to do a special work. He was chosen as a leader of the people. But his ﬁdelity
          to God did not depend upon his position.</p>
      <p>The Lord will not allow His work to be hindered, even though the workmen may prove unworthy. God has men in
          reserve, prepared to meet the demand, that His work may be preserved from all contaminating inﬂuences. God
          will be honored and gloriﬁed. When the divine Spirit impresses the mind of the man appointed by God as ﬁt for
          the work, he responds, saying, “Here am I; send me.”</p>
      <p>God demonstrated to the people for whom He had done so much that He would not serve with their sins. He
          wrought, not through those who refused to serve Him with singleness of purpose, who had corrupted their ways
          before Him, but through Nehemiah; for he was registered in the books of heaven as a man. God has said, “Them
          that honour me I will honour” (1 Samuel 2:30). Nehemiah showed himself to be a man whom God could use to put
          down false principles and to restore <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> principles; and God honored him. The Lord will
          use in His work men who are as true as steel to principle, who will not be swayed by the sophistries of those
          who have lost their spiritual <nobr>eyesight.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 2, 1899.</p>
