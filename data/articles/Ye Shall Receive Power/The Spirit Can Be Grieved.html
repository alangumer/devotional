    <h1>The Spirit Can Be Grieved</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Ephesians
          4:30.</strong></p>
      <p>I would that all my brethren and sisters would remember that it is a serious thing to grieve the Holy Spirit;
          and it is grieved when the human agent seeks to work himself, and refuses to enter the service of the Lord
          because the cross is too heavy or the <nobr>self-denial</nobr> too great. The Holy Spirit seeks to abide in
          each soul. If it is welcomed as an honored guest, those who receive it will be made complete in Christ; the
          good work begun will be ﬁnished; and holy thoughts, heavenly affections, and Christlike actions will take the
          place of impure thoughts, perverse sentiments, and rebellious acts.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is a divine teacher. If we will heed its lessons, we shall become wise unto salvation. But we
          need to guard well our hearts; for too often we forget the heavenly instruction we have received, and seek to
          act out the natural inclinations of our unconsecrated minds. Each one must ﬁght his own battle against self.
          Heed the teachings of the Holy Spirit. If this is done, they will be repeated again and again until the
          impressions are as it were lead on the rock forever.</p>
      <p>God has bought us, and He claims a throne in each heart. Our minds and bodies must be subordinated to Him; and
          the natural habits and appetites must be made subservient to the higher wants of the soul. But we can place no
          dependence upon ourselves in this work. We cannot with safety follow our own guidance. The Holy Spirit must
          renew and sanctify us. And in God’s service there must be no halfway work. Those who profess to serve God and
          yet indulge their natural impulses will mislead other souls. Said Christ, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
          with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” (Matthew 22:37). “This do, and thou shalt
          live” (Luke <nobr>10:28).—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 18:47, 48.</p>
