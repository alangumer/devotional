    <h1>The Neighborhood: A Large Field of Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and
          published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. Luke 8:39.</strong></p>
      <p>The ﬁelds are opening everywhere, calling for the living preacher. At home and abroad are openings that there
          seems no way to ﬁll. Yet there is a large number who have the light of truth, and if these would do all in
          their power to give light to others, how much might be accomplished! All cannot be preachers of the Word, but
          in their own homes all might do something for Christ. They could do a good work among their neighbors. If they
          would put their minds and hearts to the work, they might devise plans by which they could be useful in a small
          way, whatever their position.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>ever-increasing</nobr> opportunities for usefulness, the providential openings for the Word of God to
          be presented, demand our offerings of time and intellect and money, gifts large and small, as God has
          prospered us, to make a way for the truth in the dark places of the earth, to set up the standard of
          righteousness, and to advance the interests of the kingdom of Christ. The heavenly angels are waiting to unite
          with the human agent, that many souls may hear and be impressed by the Holy Spirit, and be converted.</p>
      <p>We have long been looking and waiting for the coming of the Lord; but are we doing all in our power to hasten
          His coming? “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering
          to <nobr>us-ward,</nobr> not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Peter
          3:9). While the Lord is ever working, while all heaven is engaged in the work on earth to draw men to Christ
          and repentance, what are the human agents doing to be channels of light, that they may cooperate with the
          divine agencies? Are they daily inquiring, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (Acts 9:6). Are they
          practicing <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> as did Jesus? Are they deeply stirred, their hearts drawn out in prayer
          to God that they may be receiving of His grace, the Holy Spirit of God, that they may have wisdom to work with
          their ability and their means to save souls that are perishing out of <nobr>Christ?—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, May 16, 1893.</p>
