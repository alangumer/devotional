    <h1>Rejoicing in the Word</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart:
          for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts. Jeremiah 15:16.</strong></p>
      <p>There is constant need of patience, gentleness, <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> in the
          exercise of Bible religion. But if the Word of God is made an abiding principle in our lives, everything with
          which we have to do, each word, each trivial act, will reveal that we are subject to Jesus Christ, that even
          our thoughts have been brought into captivity to Him. If the Word of God is received into the heart, it will
          empty the soul of <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> and <nobr>self-dependence.</nobr> Our lives will be a power for
          good, because the Holy Spirit will ﬁll our minds with the things of God. The religion of Christ will be
          practiced by us; for our wills are in perfect conformity to the will of God.</p>
      <p>Some who profess to have true religion sadly neglect the Guidebook given by God to point the way to heaven.
          They may read the Bible, but merely reading God’s Word, as one would read words traced by a human pen, will
          give only a superﬁcial knowledge. Talking of the truth will not sanctify the receivers. They may profess to be
          working for God, when, were Christ among them, His voice would be heard, saying, “Ye do err, not knowing the
          Scriptures, nor the power of God” (Matthew 22:29). Such cannot know what true religion means.</p>
      <p>“The words that I speak unto you,” said Christ, “they are spirit, and they are life” (John 6:63). Jeremiah
          testiﬁes to the Word of God, saying, “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the
          joy and rejoicing of mine heart.” There is divine healing in God’s Word, which the <nobr>so-called</nobr> wise
          and prudent cannot experience, but which is revealed to babes. “The entrance of thy words giveth light; it
          giveth understanding unto the simple” (Psalm 119:130). If this Word is enshrined in the heart, it becomes the
          <nobr>treasure-house</nobr> of the mind, from which we bring forth things new and old. We no longer ﬁnd
          pleasure in thinking of the common things of earth, but say, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light
          unto my path” (verse <nobr>105).—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 4, 1897.</p>
