    <h1>Unseen as the Wind</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or
          whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit. John 3:8, RSV.</strong></p>
      <p>The wind is heard among the branches of the trees, rustling the leaves and ﬂowers; yet it is invisible, and no
          man knows whence it comes or whither it goes. So with the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart. [The Spirit]
          can no more be explained than can the movements of the wind. A person may not be able to tell the exact time
          or place, or to trace all the circumstances in the process of conversion; but this does not prove him to be
          unconverted.</p>
      <p>By an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ is constantly working upon the heart. Little by little, perhaps
          unconsciously to the receiver, impressions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ. These may be
          received through meditating upon Him, through reading the Scriptures, or through hearing the Word from the
          living preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with more direct appeal, the soul gladly surrenders itself to
          Jesus. By many this is called sudden conversion; but it is the result of long wooing by the Spirit of
          <nobr>God—a</nobr> patient, protracted process. While the wind is itself invisible, it produces effects that
          are seen and felt. So the work of the Spirit upon the soul will reveal itself in every act of him who has felt
          its saving power. When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful
          thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and
          strife. Joy takes the place of sadness, and the countenance reﬂects the light of heaven. No one sees the hand
          that lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith
          the soul surrenders itself to God. Then that power which no human eye can see creates a new being in the image
          of God.</p>
      <p>It is impossible for ﬁnite minds to comprehend the work of redemption. Its mystery exceeds human knowledge; yet
          he who passes from death to life realizes that it is a divine reality. The beginning of redemption we may know
          here through a personal experience. Its results reach through the eternal <nobr>ages.—The</nobr> Desire of
          Ages, 172, 173.</p>
