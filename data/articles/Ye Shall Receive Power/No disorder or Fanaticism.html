    <h1>No disorder or Fanaticism</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to
          exhort and to convince the gainsayers. Titus 1:9.</strong></p>
      <p>There is constant danger of allowing something to come into our midst that we may regard as the workings of the
          Holy Spirit, but that in reality is the fruit of a spirit of fanaticism. So long as we allow the enemy of
          truth to lead us into a wrong way, we cannot hope to reach the honest in heart with the third angel’s message.
          We are to be sanctiﬁed through obedience to the truth. I am afraid of anything that would have a tendency to
          turn the mind away from the solid evidences of the truth as revealed in God’s Word. I am afraid of it; I am
          afraid of it.</p>
      <p>We must bring our minds within the bounds of reason, lest the enemy so come in as to set everything in a
          disorderly way. There are persons of an excitable temperament who are easily led into fanaticism; and should
          we allow anything to come into our churches that would lead such persons into error, we would soon see these
          errors carried to extreme lengths, and then because of the course of these disorderly elements, a stigma would
          rest upon the whole body of <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists.</p>
      <p>I have been studying how to get some of these early experiences into print again, so that more of our people
          may be informed, for I have long known that fanaticism will be manifest again, in different ways. We are to
          strengthen our position by dwelling on the Word, and by avoiding all oddities and strange exercisings that
          some would be very quick to catch up and practice. If we were to allow confusion to come into our ranks, we
          could not bind off our work as we should....</p>
      <p>How afraid I am to have anything of a fanatical nature brought in among our people. There are many, many who
          must be sanctiﬁed, but they are to be sanctiﬁed through obedience to the message of
          <nobr>truth.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:43, 44.</p>
