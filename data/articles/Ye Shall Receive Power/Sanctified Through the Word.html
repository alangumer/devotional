    <h1>Sanctiﬁed Through the Word</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. John 17:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The burden of Jesus’ request was that those who believed on Him might be kept from the evil of the world, and
          sanctiﬁed through the truth. He does not leave us to vague surmising as to what the truth is, but adds, “Thy
          word is truth.” The Word of God is the means by which our sanctiﬁcation is to be accomplished. It is of the
          greatest importance, then, that we acquaint ourselves with the sacred instruction of the Bible. It is as
          necessary for us to understand the words of life as it was for the early disciples to be informed concerning
          the plan of salvation.</p>
      <p>We shall be inexcusable if, through our own negligence, we are ignorant of the claims of God’s Word. God has
          given us His Word, the revelation of His will, and has promised the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, to guide
          them into all truth; and every soul who honestly desires to do the will of God shall know of the
          doctrine.</p>
      <p>The world is full of false teaching; and if we do not resolutely search the Scriptures for ourselves, we shall
          accept its errors for truth, adopt its customs, and deceive our own hearts. The doctrines and customs of the
          world are at variance with the truth of God. Those who seek to turn from the service of the world to the
          service of God will need divine help. They will have to set their faces like a ﬂint toward Zion. They will
          feel the opposition of the world, the ﬂesh, and the devil, and will have to go contrary to the spirit and
          inﬂuences of the world.</p>
      <p>Since the time when the Son of God breasted the haughty prejudices and unbelief of mankind, there has been no
          change in the attitude of the world toward the religion of Jesus. The servants of Christ must meet the same
          spirit of opposition and reproach, and must go “without the camp, bearing his reproach” (Hebrews 13:13).</p>
      <p>The mission of Jesus was demonstrated by convincing miracles. His doctrine astonished the people. It was not
          the contradictory jargon of the scribes, full of mysticism, burdened with absurd forms and meaningless
          exactions; but it was a system of truth that met the wants of the heart. His teaching was plain, clear, and
          comprehensive. The practical truths He uttered had a convincing power, and arrested the attention of the
          <nobr>people.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 7, 1888.</p>
