    <h1>Beholding Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. Isaiah
          45:22.</strong></p>
      <p>In order to meet the requirement of the law, our faith must grasp the righteousness of Christ, accepting it as
          our righteousness. Through union with Christ, through acceptance of His righteousness by faith, we may be
          qualiﬁed to work the works of God, to be colaborers with Christ. If you are willing to drift along with the
          current of evil, and do not cooperate with the heavenly agencies in restraining transgression in your family,
          and in the church, in order that everlasting righteousness may be brought in, you do not have faith.</p>
      <p>Faith works by love and puriﬁes the soul. Through faith the Holy Spirit works in the heart to create holiness
          therein; but this cannot be done unless the human agent will work with Christ. We can be ﬁtted for heaven only
          through the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart; for we must have Christ’s righteousness as our credentials
          if we would ﬁnd access to the Father. In order that we may have the righteousness of Christ, we need daily to
          be transformed by the inﬂuence of the Spirit, to be a partaker of the divine nature. It is the work of the
          Holy Spirit to elevate the taste, to sanctify the heart, to ennoble the whole man.</p>
      <p>Let the soul look to Jesus. “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). No
          one will be forced to look to Christ; but the voice of invitation is sounding in yearning entreaty, “Look and
          live.” In looking to Christ, we shall see that His love is without a parallel, that He has taken the place of
          the guilty sinner, and has imputed unto him His spotless righteousness.</p>
      <p>When the sinner sees his Saviour dying upon the cross under the curse of sin in his stead, beholding His
          pardoning love, love awakes in his heart. The sinner loves Christ, because Christ has ﬁrst loved him, and love
          is the fulﬁlling of the law. The repenting soul realizes that God “is faithful and just to forgive us our
          sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). The Spirit of God works in the believer’s
          soul, enabling him to advance from one line of obedience to another, reaching on from strength to greater
          strength, from grace to grace in Christ <nobr>Jesus.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 1, 1892.</p>
