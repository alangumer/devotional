    <h1>Eating of the Tree of Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will
          I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. Revelation 2:7.</strong></p>
      <p>This message concerns all our churches. You can never employ your faculty of hearing better than in hearkening
          to hear what the voice of God speaks to you in His Word. There is a rich and abundant promise to those who
          overcome. It is not enough to enter upon this warfare, we must pursue it to the end. We must know nothing of
          yielding. We must ﬁght the good ﬁght of faith to the very end. To the overcomer is promised the triumphal
          victory. “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise
          of God.” Whatever was lost in the fall of Adam is more than restored in redemption. He that sitteth on the
          throne saith, “Behold, I make all things new” (Revelation 21:5).</p>
      <p>Let us look closely and critically to ourselves. Are not the vows we entered into at our baptism violated? Are
          we dead to the world and alive unto Christ? Are we seeking those things which are above, where Christ sitteth
          at the right hand of God? Is the cable cut which anchored us to the eternal Rock? Are we drifting with the
          current to perdition? Shall we make no effort to press and urge our passage upstream? Let us not hesitate
          longer, but vigorously apply the oars; and let us do our ﬁrst works ere we make hopeless shipwreck.</p>
      <p>It is our work to know our special failings and sins, which cause darkness and spiritual feebleness, and
          quenched our ﬁrst love. Is it worldliness? Is it selﬁshness? Is it the love of <nobr>self-esteem?</nobr> Is it
          striving to be ﬁrst? Is it the sin of sensuality that is intensely active? Is it the sin of the Nicolaitans,
          turning the grace of God into lasciviousness? Is it the misuse and abuse of great light and opportunities and
          privileges, making boasted claims to wisdom and religious knowledge, while the life and character are
          inconsistent and immoral? Whatever it is that has been petted and cultivated until it has become strong and
          overmastering, make determined efforts to overcome, else you will be <nobr>lost.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          June 7, 1887.</p>
