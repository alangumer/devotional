    <h1>Looking for Treasures</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a ﬁeld; the which when a man hath found, he
          hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that ﬁeld. Matthew
          13:44.</strong></p>
      <p>In our day the church has been to a great degree content with the surface truths of revelation, made so plain
          and easy to be understood that many have thought these supplied all that was essential, and in accepting them
          they have been content. But the Holy Spirit, working upon the mind, will not allow it to rest in indolence. It
          awakens an earnest desire for truth uncorrupted with error and false doctrines. Celestial truth will reward
          the diligent seeker. The mind that is really desirous to know what is truth cannot be content in
          indolence.</p>
      <p>The kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure hid in a ﬁeld, “the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and
          for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that ﬁeld.” He buys it that he may work it,
          plow up every part of it, and take possession of its treasures. It is the Holy Spirit’s ofﬁce to direct this
          search and to reward it. The searcher, while digging the ﬁeld, ﬁnds leads of precious ore of which he seeks to
          estimate the value, and he sinks the shaft deeper, for still more valuable treasure. Thus many a rich lode is
          discovered. The gold ﬁelds of the earth are not so interlaced with veins of precious ore as is the ﬁeld of
          revelation with leads that bring to view the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
      <p>The Lord would have every one of His believing children rich in faith; and this is the fruit of the working of
          the Holy Spirit upon the heart. From the heart the Spirit works outward, developing a character that God will
          approve. What a vast ﬁeld of the treasures of truth did Christ add to the domain of faith to be appropriated
          by His disciples! We need greater faith if we would have better knowledge of the Word. The greatest hindrance
          to our receiving the divine illumination is that we do not depend on the efﬁciency of the Holy
          <nobr>Spirit.—The</nobr> Ellen G. White 1888 Materials, 1537, 1538.</p>
