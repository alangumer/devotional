    <h1>A Prayer in Behalf of God’s People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy
          city and thy people are called by thy name. Daniel 9:19.</strong></p>
      <p>Heavenly Father, Thou hast said, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall ﬁnd; knock, and it shall
          be opened unto you” (Matthew 7:7) . Heavenly Father, we need Thy Holy Spirit. We do not want to work
          ourselves, only as we work in unity with God. We want to be in a position where the Holy Spirit of God shall
          be upon us with its reviving, sanctifying power. Wilt Thou manifest Thyself unto us this very morning! Wilt
          Thou sweep away every mist and every cloud of darkness!</p>
      <p>We come to Thee, our compassionate Redeemer; and we ask Thee, for Christ’s <nobr>sake—for</nobr> Thine own
          Son’s sake, my Father, that Thou wilt manifest Thy power unto Thy people here. We want wisdom; we want
          righteousness; we want truth; we want the Holy Spirit to be with us.</p>
      <p>Thou hast presented before us a great work that must be carried forward in behalf of those that are in the
          truth, and in behalf of those that are in ignorance of our faith; and oh, Lord, as Thou hast given to every
          man his work, we beseech of Thee that the Holy Spirit may impress the human mind in regard to the burden of
          work that shall rest upon every individual soul, according to Thine appointment. We want to be proved; we want
          to be sanctiﬁed through and through; we want to be ﬁtted up for the work; and here, right here in this session
          of the conference, we want to see a revelation of the Holy Spirit of God. We want light,
          <nobr>Lord—Thou</nobr> art the Light. We want truth, <nobr>Lord—Thou</nobr> art the Truth. We want the right
          <nobr>way—Thou</nobr> art the Way.</p>
      <p>Lord, I beseech of Thee that we may all be wise enough to discern that we must individually open the heart to
          Jesus Christ, that through the Holy Spirit He may come in to mold and fashion us anew, in accordance with the
          divine Image. Oh, my Father, my Father! melt and subdue our <nobr>hearts.—The</nobr> General Conference
          Bulletin, April 2, 1903.</p>
