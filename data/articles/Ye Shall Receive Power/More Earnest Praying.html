    <h1>More Earnest Praying</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against
          thee. Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy
          covenant with us. Jeremiah 14:20, 21.</strong></p>
      <p>Let our prayers ascend to God for His converting, transforming grace. Meetings should be held in every church
          for solemn prayer and earnest searching of the Word to know what is truth. Take the promises of God, and ask
          God in living faith for the outpouring of His Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit is shed upon us, marrow and
          fatness will be drawn from the Word of God....</p>
      <p>When the churches become living, working churches, the Holy Spirit will be given in answer to their sincere
          request. Then the truth of God’s Word will be regarded with new interest, and will be explored as if it were a
          revelation just from the courts above. Every declaration of inspiration concerning Christ will take hold of
          the inmost soul of those who love Him. Envy, jealousy, evil surmising, will cease. The Bible will be regarded
          as a charter from heaven. Its study will absorb the mind, and its truths will feast the soul. The promises of
          God now repeated as if the soul had never tasted of His love, will then glow upon the altar of the heart, and
          fall in burning words from the lips of the messengers of God. They will then plead with souls with an
          earnestness that cannot be repulsed. Then the windows of heaven will be open for the showers of the latter
          rain. The followers of Christ will be united in love.</p>
      <p>The only way the truth can be presented to the world, in its pure and holy character, is for those who claim to
          believe it to be exponents of its power. The Bible requires the sons and daughters of God to stand on an
          elevated platform; for God calls upon them to represent Christ to the world. As they represent Christ, they
          represent the Father. Unity of believers testiﬁes of their oneness with Christ, and this unity is required by
          the accumulated light which now shines upon the pathway of the children of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, February 25, 1890.</p>
