      <p><strong>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of
          mind, meekness, longsuffering. Colossians 3:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The Captain of our salvation made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, in order
          that humanity might be allied to divinity. Man is to represent Christ. He is to be <nobr>long-suffering</nobr>
          toward his fellow men, to be patient, forgiving, and full of Christlike love. He who is truly converted will
          manifest respect for his brethren; he will do as Christ has commanded. Jesus said, “A new commandment I give
          unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men
          know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” (John 13:34, 35). Where the love of Christ
          abounds in the soul, there will be an expression of that love that will be understood by the world....</p>
      <p>Not all who name the name of Christ are one with Christ. Those who do not have the Spirit and the grace of
          Christ are none of His, no matter what may be their profession. By their fruits ye shall know them. The
          customs and practices that are after the order of the world do not carry out the principles of God’s law, and
          therefore do not breathe of His Spirit nor express His character. Christlikeness will be revealed only by
          those who are assimilated to the divine image. Only those who are being molded through the operation of the
          Holy Spirit are doers of the Word of God, and express the mind and the will of God.</p>
      <p>There is counterfeit Christianity in the world as well as genuine Christianity. The true spirit of a man is
          manifested by the way in which he deals with his fellow man. We may ask the question, Does he represent the
          character of Christ in spirit and action, or simply manifest the natural, selﬁsh traits of character that
          belong to the people of this world? Profession weighs nothing with God. Before it is everlastingly too late
          for wrongs to be righted, let each one ask himself, “What am I?” It depends upon ourselves as to whether we
          shall form such characters as will constitute us members of God’s royal family <nobr>above.—The</nobr> Review
          and Herald, April 9, 1895.</p>
