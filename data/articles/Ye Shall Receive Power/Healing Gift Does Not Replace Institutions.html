      <p><strong>And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy
          departed from him. And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for
          thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. Luke 5:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>The remark is often made, by one and another, “Why depend so much on sanitariums? Why do we not pray for the
          miraculous healing of the sick, as the people of God used to do?” In the early history of our work many were
          healed by prayer. And some, after they were healed, pursued the same course in the indulgence of appetite that
          they had followed in the past. They did not live and work in such a way as to avoid sickness. They did not
          show that they appreciated the Lord’s goodness to them. Again and again they were brought to suffering through
          their own careless, thoughtless course of action. How could the Lord be gloriﬁed in bestowing on them the gift
          of health?</p>
      <p>When the light came that we should have a sanitarium, the reason was plainly given. There were many who needed
          to be educated in regard to healthful living. A place must be provided to which the sick could be taken, where
          they could be taught how to live so as to preserve health....</p>
      <p>Lectures should be diligently kept up as a means of teaching the patients how to prevent disease by a wise
          course of action. By means of these lectures the patients may be shown the responsibility resting on them to
          keep the body in the most healthful condition because it is the Lord’s purchased possession. Mind, soul, and
          body are bought with a price.... “Therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s”
          (1</p>
      <p>Corinthians 6:20)....</p>
      <p>In the providence of God, instruction has been given that sanitariums be established, in order that the sick
          may be drawn to them, and learn how to live healthfully. The establishment of sanitariums is a providential
          arrangement, whereby people from all churches are to be reached, and made acquainted with the saving truth for
          this <nobr>time.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 7:378, 379.</p>
