    <h1>The Spirit Loves to Work With Children</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto
          you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
          Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
          And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these
          little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that
          he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Matthew <nobr>18:2-6.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Oh, for a clear perception of what we might accomplish if we would learn of Jesus! The springs of heavenly
          peace and joy, unsealed in the soul of the teacher by the magic words of inspiration, will become a mighty
          river of inﬂuence, to bless all who connect with Him. Do not think that the Bible will become a tiresome book
          to the children. Under a wise instructor the work will become more and more desirable. It will be to them as
          the bread of life, and will never grow old. There is in it a freshness and beauty that attract and charm the
          children and youth. It is like the sun shining upon the earth, giving its brightness and warmth, yet never
          exhausted. By lessons from the Bible history and doctrine, the children and youth can learn that all other
          books are inferior to this. They can ﬁnd here a fountain of mercy and of love.</p>
      <p>God’s holy, educating Spirit is in His Word. A light, a new and precious light, shines forth upon every page.
          Truth is there revealed, and words and sentences are made bright and appropriate for the occasion, as the
          voice of God speaking to them.</p>
      <p>We need to recognize the Holy Spirit as our enlightener. That Spirit loves to address the children, and
          discover to them the treasures and beauties of the Word of God. The promises spoken by the great Teacher will
          captivate the senses and animate the soul of the child with a spiritual power that is divine. There will grow
          in the fruitful a familiarity with divine things, which will be as a barricade against the temptations of the
          <nobr>enemy.—The</nobr> General Conference Bulletin, April 1, 1898.</p>
