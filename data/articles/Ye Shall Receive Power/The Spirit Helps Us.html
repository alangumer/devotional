    <h1>The Spirit Helps Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our inﬁrmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought:
          but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Romans
          8:26.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit indites all genuine prayer. I have learned to know that in all my intercessions the Spirit
          intercedes for me and for all saints; but His intercessions are according to the will of God, never contrary
          to His will. “The Spirit also helpeth our inﬁrmities”; and the Spirit, being God, knoweth the mind of God;
          therefore in every prayer of ours for the sick, or for other needs, the will of God is to be regarded. “For
          what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God
          knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God” (1 Corinthians 2:11).</p>
      <p>If we are taught of God, we shall pray in conformity to His revealed will, and in submission to His will which
          we know not. We are to make supplication according to the will of God, relying on the precious Word, and
          believing that Christ not only gave Himself for but to His disciples. The record declares, “He breathed on
          them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost” (John 20:22).</p>
      <p>Jesus is waiting to breathe upon all His disciples, and give them the inspiration of His sanctifying Spirit,
          and transfuse the vital inﬂuence from Himself to His people. He would have them understand that henceforth
          they cannot serve two masters. Their lives cannot be divided. Christ is to live in His human agents, and work
          through their faculties, and act through their capabilities. Their will must be submitted to His will, they
          must act with His Spirit that it may be no more they that live, but Christ that liveth in them. Jesus is
          seeking to impress upon them the thought that in giving His Holy Spirit He is giving to them the glory which
          the Father has given Him, that He and His people may be one in God. Our way and will must be in submission to
          God’s will, knowing that it is holy, just, and <nobr>good.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, October 3,
          1892.</p>
