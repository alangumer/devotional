    <h1>Moses</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the
          children of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto
          thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
          this mountain. Exodus 3:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>Devotion and humility have ever characterized the men with whom God has entrusted important responsibilities in
          His work. The divine call to Moses in the desert found him distrustful of self. He realized his unﬁtness for
          the position to which God had called him; but having accepted the trust, he became a polished instrument in
          the hand of God to accomplish the greatest work ever committed to mortals.</p>
      <p>Had Moses trusted to his own strength and wisdom, and eagerly accepted the great charge, he would have evinced
          his entire unﬁtness for such a work. The fact that a man feels his own weakness is at least some evidence that
          he realizes the magnitude of the work appointed him, and this gives room for hope that he will make God his
          counselor and his strength. Such a person will move no farther nor faster than he knows God is leading
          him.</p>
      <p>A man will gain power and efﬁciency as he accepts the responsibilities which God places upon him, and with his
          whole soul seeks to qualify himself to bear them aright. However humble his position or limited his ability,
          that individual will attain true greatness who cheerfully responds to the call of duty, and, trusting to the
          divine strength, seeks to perform his work with ﬁdelity. He will feel that he has a sacred commission to
          battle against wrong, to strengthen the right, to elevate, comfort, and bless his fellow men. Indolence,
          selﬁshness, and love of worldly approbation must yield to this high and holy calling.</p>
      <p>Engaged in such a work, the weak man will become strong; the timid, brave; the irresolute, ﬁrm and decided.
          Each sees the importance of his position and his course, inasmuch as heaven has chosen him to do a special
          work for the King of kings. Such men will leave the world better for their having lived in it. Their inﬂuence
          is exerted to elevate, to purify, and to ennoble all with whom they come in contact, and thus they help to
          prepare their fellow men for the heavenly <nobr>courts.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 11, 1881.</p>
