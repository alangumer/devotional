      <p><strong>Enlightened Through the Spirit</strong></p>
      <p>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what
          the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. Ephesians 1:18.</p>
      <p>The apostle Paul makes supplication to God: “That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
          give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding
          being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his
          inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to <nobr>us-ward</nobr> who
          believe, according to the working of his mighty power” (Ephesians <nobr>1:17-19).</nobr> But the mind must
          ﬁrst be made adaptable to the nature of the truth to be investigated. The eyes of the understanding must be
          enlightened, and heart and mind brought into harmony with God, who is truth.</p>
      <p>He who beholds Jesus with the eye of faith sees no glory in himself; for the glory of the Redeemer is reﬂected
          into the mind and heart. The atonement of His blood is realized, and the taking away of sin stirs his heart
          with gratitude. Being justiﬁed by Christ, the receiver of truth is constrained to make an entire surrender to
          God, and is admitted into the school of Christ, that he may learn of Him who is meek and lowly of heart. A
          knowledge of the love of God is shed abroad in his heart. He exclaims, Oh, what love! What condescension!
          Grasping the rich promises of faith, he becomes a partaker of the divine nature. His heart being emptied of
          self, the waters of life ﬂow in, and the glory of the Lord shines forth. Perpetually looking unto Jesus, the
          human is assimilated by the divine. The believer is changed into His likeness.</p>
      <p>“We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
          glory to glory [from character to character] even as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2 Corinthians 3:18). The
          human character is changed into the divine. It is the spiritual eye that discerns this glory. It is veiled,
          shrouded in mystery, until the Holy Spirit imparts this discernment to the <nobr>soul.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, February 18, 1896.</p>
