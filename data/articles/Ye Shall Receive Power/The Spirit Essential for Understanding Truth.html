    <h1>The Spirit Essential for Understanding Truth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep
          things of God. 1 Corinthians 2:10.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a great work to be done for this time, and we do not half realize what the Lord is willing to do for
          His people. We talk about the ﬁrst angel’s message, and the second angel’s message, and we think we have some
          understanding of the third angel’s message; but we should not be satisﬁed with our present knowledge. Our
          petitions, mingled with faith and contrition, should go up to God, for an understanding of the mysteries that
          God would make known to His saints. We should have a realization that unless taught by the Holy Spirit, we
          shall not rightly comprehend the Bible; for it is a sealed book even to the learned, who are wise in their own
          conceit.</p>
      <p>Jesus meant just what He said when He directed His disciples to “search the Scriptures.” Searching means to
          compare scripture with scripture, and spiritual things with spiritual. We should not be satisﬁed with a
          superﬁcial knowledge. We should search for the hidden treasure concealed beneath the surface, as the
          merchantman seeks for goodly pearls. Light, great light, will reward the diligent searcher for truth.</p>
      <p>There are many who have not taxed their mental powers, and who have no experience in putting to the stretch
          their utmost ability to ﬁnd out what is truth. It is not possible that the Holy Spirit shall fall upon you
          unless you feel your need, and are more desirous for its descent than you now are. You should realize that you
          are living upon the very borders of the eternal world, that Christ is coming very soon, and that all heaven is
          interested in the work that is in progress in ﬁtting up a people for His coming.</p>
      <p>If ever there was a people that needed to heed the counsel of the True Witness to the Laodicean church to be
          zealous and to repent before God, it is the people who have had opened up before them the stupendous truths
          for this time, and who have not lived up to their high privileges and responsibilities. We have lost much in
          not living up to the light of the solemn truths which we profess to <nobr>believe.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, June 4, 1889.</p>
