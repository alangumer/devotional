      <p><strong>Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: who have for my life laid down their own necks:
          unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. Romans 16:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>Paul set an example against the sentiment, then gaining inﬂuence in the church, that the gospel could be
          proclaimed successfully only by those who were wholly freed from the necessity of physical toil. He
          illustrated in a practical way what might be done by consecrated laymen in many places where the people were
          unacquainted with the truths of the gospel. His course inspired many humble toilers with a desire to do what
          they could do to advance the cause of God, while at the same time they supported themselves in daily
          labor.</p>
      <p>Aquila and Priscilla were not called to give their whole time to the ministry of the gospel, yet these humble
          laborers were used by God to show Apollos the way of truth more perfectly. The Lord employs various
          instrumentalities for the accomplishment of His purpose, and while some with special talents are chosen to
          devote all their energies to the work of teaching and preaching the gospel, many others, upon whom human hands
          have never been laid in ordination, are called to act an important part in soulsaving.</p>
      <p>There is a large ﬁeld open before the <nobr>self-supporting</nobr> gospel worker. Many may gain valuable
          experiences in ministry while toiling a portion of the time at some form of manual labor, and by this method
          strong workers may be developed for important service in needy ﬁelds.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> servant of God who labors untiringly in word and doctrine carries on his heart
          a heavy burden. He does not measure his work by hours. His wages do not inﬂuence him in his labor, nor is he
          turned from his duty because of unfavorable conditions. From heaven he received his commission, and to heaven
          he looks for his recompense when the work entrusted to him is <nobr>done.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles,
          355, 356.</p>
