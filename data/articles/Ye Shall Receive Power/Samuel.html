    <h1>Samuel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all
          Israel from Dan even to <nobr>Beer-sheba</nobr> knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.
          1 Samuel 3:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>During the years since the Lord ﬁrst manifested Himself to the son of Hannah, Samuel’s call to the prophetic
          ofﬁce had come to be acknowledged by the whole nation. By faithfully delivering the divine warning to the
          house of Eli, painful and trying as the duty had been, Samuel had given proof of his ﬁdelity as Jehovah’s
          messenger; “and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from
          Dan even to <nobr>Beer-sheba</nobr> knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.”</p>
      <p>The Israelites as a nation still continued in a state of irreligion and idolatry, and as a punishment they
          remained in subjection to the Philistines. During this time Samuel visited the cities and villages throughout
          the land, seeking to turn the hearts of the people to the God of their fathers; and his efforts were not
          without good results. After suffering the oppression of their enemies for twenty years, the Israelites
          “mourned after the Lord.” Samuel counseled them, “If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put
          away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only”
          (1 Samuel 7:3).</p>
      <p>Here we see that practical piety, heart religion, was taught in the days of Samuel as taught by Christ when He
          was upon the earth. Without the grace of Christ the outward forms of religion were valueless to ancient
          Israel. They are the same to modern Israel.</p>
      <p>There is need today of such a revival of true heart religion as was experienced by ancient Israel. Repentance
          is the ﬁrst step that must be taken by all who would return to God. No one can do this work for another. We
          must individually humble our souls before God and put away our idols. When we have done all that we can do,
          the Lord will manifest to us His <nobr>salvation.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 589, 590.</p>
