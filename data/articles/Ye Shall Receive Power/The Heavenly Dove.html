    <h1>The Heavenly Dove</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon
          him. John 1:32.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is our example in all things. In response to His prayer to His Father, heaven was opened, and the Spirit
          descended like a dove and abode upon Him. The Holy Spirit of God is to communicate with man, and to abide in
          the hearts of the obedient and faithful. Light and strength will come to those who earnestly seek it in order
          that they may have wisdom to resist Satan, and to overcome in times of temptation. We are to overcome even as
          Christ overcame.</p>
      <p>Jesus opened His public mission with fervent prayer, and His example makes manifest the fact that prayer is
          necessary in order to lead a successful Christian life. He was constantly in communion with His Father, and
          His life presents to us a perfect pattern which we are to imitate. He appreciated the privilege of prayer, and
          His work showed the results of communion with God. Examining the record of His life, we ﬁnd that upon all
          important occasions He retired to the grove, or to the solitude of the mountains, and offered earnest,
          persevering prayer to God. He frequently devoted the entire night to prayer just before He was called upon to
          work some mighty miracle. During these nightly seasons of prayer, after the labors of the day, He
          compassionately dismissed His disciples, that they might return to their homes for rest and sleep, while with
          strong crying and tears He poured forth earnest petitions to God in behalf of humanity.</p>
      <p>Jesus was braced for duty and fortiﬁed for trial through the grace of God that came to Him in answer to prayer.
          We are dependent upon God for success in living the Christian life, and Christ’s example opens before us the
          path by which we may come to a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> source of strength, from which we may draw grace and
          power to resist the enemy and to come off victorious. On the banks of Jordan Christ offered prayer as the
          representative of humanity, and the opening heaven and the voice of approval assures us that God accepts
          humanity through the merits of His <nobr>Son.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, July 24, 1893.</p>
