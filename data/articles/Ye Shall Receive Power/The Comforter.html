    <h1>The Comforter</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak
          of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. John
          16:13.</strong></p>
      <p>How can we stand in the day of test if we do not understand the words of Christ? He said: “These things have I
          spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
          send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have
          said unto you” (John 14:25, 26). It is the Holy Spirit that is to bring to our remembrance the words of
          Christ. The theme Christ chose to dwell upon in His last discourse to His disciples was that of the ofﬁce of
          the Holy Spirit. He opened before them a wide tract of truth. They were to receive His words by faith, and the
          Comforter, the Holy Spirit, was to bring all things to their remembrance.</p>
      <p>The consolation given by Christ in this promise was found in the fact that the divine inﬂuence was to be with
          His followers to the end. But this promise is not accepted and believed by the people today, and therefore is
          not cherished by them, nor is its fulﬁllment seen in the experience of the church. The promise of the gift of
          the Spirit of God is left as a matter to be little considered by the church. It is not impressed upon the
          people, and the result is only that which might be <nobr>expected—spiritual</nobr> drought, spiritual
          darkness, spiritual declension and death. Minor matters occupy the mind and soul, but divine power which is
          necessary for the growth and prosperity of the church, which would, if possessed, bring all other blessings in
          its train, is lacking, although it is offered to us in inﬁnite plentitude. Just as long as the church are
          satisﬁed with small things, they are disqualiﬁed to receive the great things of God. But why do we not hunger
          and thirst after the gift of the Holy Spirit, since it is the means whereby the heart may be kept pure? The
          Lord designs that divine power shall cooperate with human effort.</p>
      <p>It is <nobr>all-essential</nobr> for the Christian to understand the meaning of the promise of the Holy Spirit
          just prior to the coming of our Lord Jesus the second time. Talk of it, pray for it, preach concerning it; for
          the Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit than parents are to give good gifts to their
          <nobr>children.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 15, 1892.</p>
