      <p><strong>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Ephesians
          6:10.</strong></p>
      <p>As a people, we are looking for the coming of the Lord in the clouds of heaven; and how carefully should we
          examine our hearts that we may know whether or not we are in the faith. There seems to be a mist before the
          eyes of many, for they fail to discern spiritual things, and do not recognize the workings of Satan to entrap
          their souls. Christians are not to be the slaves of passion; they are to be controlled by the Spirit of God.
          But many become the sport of the enemy, because when temptation come, they do not rest in Jesus, but worry
          themselves out of His arms, and in perplexity lose all their faith and courage. They do not remember that
          Jesus has helped them out of difﬁculties in the past, that His grace is sufﬁcient for the daily trials, and
          that He can help in the present trouble.</p>
      <p>We make failures in our little, daily difﬁculties, and allow them to irritate and vex us; we fall under them,
          and so make stumbling blocks for ourselves and others. But blessings of the greatest importance are to result
          from the patient endurance of these daily vexations; for we are to gain strength to bear greater difﬁculties.
          Satan will press upon us the most severe temptations, and we must learn to come to God in any and every
          emergency....</p>
      <p>We profess to be Bible Christians, and we are not left in the dark to take step after step in uncertainty. We
          are to know where we are going. We cannot be in darkness if we are following Christ as our leader; for He
          says, “He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). When
          the way seems beset with difﬁculty, and clouded with darkness, we must believe that there is light ahead, and
          not turn to the right or left, but press forward, notwithstanding all our trials and
          <nobr>temptations.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 19, 1891.</p>
