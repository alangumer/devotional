    <h1>There Is Always an Open Door</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a
          little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. Revelation 3:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who shall be overcomers are to be highly exalted before God and before His angels. Christ has promised
          that He will confess their names before His Father and before the holy angels of heaven. He has given us
          abundant promises to encourage us to be overcomers. The True Witness has given us the assurance that He has
          set before us an open door, which no man can shut.</p>
      <p>Those who are seeking to be faithful to God may be denied many of the privileges of the world; their way may be
          hedged up and their work hindered by the enemies of truth; but there is no power that can close the door of
          communication between God and their souls. The Christian himself may close this door by indulgence in sin, or
          by rejection of heaven’s light. He may turn away his ears from hearing the message of truth, and in this way
          sever the connection between God and his soul.</p>
      <p>You may have ears, and not hear. You may have eyes, and not see the light, nor receive the illumination that
          God has provided for you. You may close the door to light as effectually as the Pharisees closed the door to
          Christ when He taught among them. They would not receive the light and knowledge He brought, because it did
          not come in the way they had expected it to come. Christ was the Light of the world, and if they had received
          the light He graciously brought to them, it would have resulted in their salvation, but they rejected the Holy
          One of Israel.</p>
      <p>Christ said of them that they “loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one
          that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved” (John 3:19,
          20). He said, “Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life” (John 5:40). The way was open; but by their
          own course of action they closed the door, and severed their connection with Christ. We may do the same by
          rejecting light and <nobr>truth.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 26, 1889.</p>
