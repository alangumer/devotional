    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
          doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Ephesians
          4:14.</strong></p>
      <p>The voice of God is speaking to us through His Word, and there are many voices that we will hear; but Christ
          has said we should beware of them who will say, Here is Christ or there is Christ. Then how shall we know that
          they have not the truth, unless we bring everything to the Scriptures? Christ has warned us to beware of false
          prophets who will come to us in His name, saying that they are Christ.</p>
      <p>Now, if you should take the position that it is not important for you to understand the Scriptures for
          yourselves, you will be in danger of being led away with these doctrines. Christ has said that there will be a
          company who in the day of retributive judgment will say, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and
          in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?” But Christ will say, “Depart
          from me, ye that work iniquity” (Matthew 7:22, 23)....</p>
      <p>The time is coming when Satan will work miracles right in your sight, claiming that he is Christ; and if your
          feet are not ﬁrmly established upon the truth of God, then you will be led away from your foundation. The only
          safety for you is to search for the truth as for hid treasures. Dig for the truth as you would for treasures
          in the earth, and present the Word of God, the Bible, before your heavenly Father, and say, Enlighten me;
          teach me what is truth.</p>
      <p>And when His Holy Spirit shall come into your hearts, to impress the truth into your souls, you will not let it
          go easily. You have gained such an experience in searching the Scriptures, that every point is established.
          And it is important that you continually search the Scriptures. You should store the mind with the Word of
          God; for you may be separated, and placed where you will not have the privilege of meeting with the children
          of God. Then you will want the treasures of God’s Word hidden in your hearts, and when opposition comes around
          you, you will need to bring everything to the <nobr>Scriptures.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 3,
          1888.</p>
