    <h1>The Heart Changed</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the
          stony heart out of your ﬂesh, and I will give you an heart of ﬂesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and
          cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. Ezekiel 36:26,
          27.</strong></p>
      <p>The heart of man may be the abode of the Holy Spirit. The peace of Christ that passeth understanding may rest
          in your soul, and the transforming power of His grace may work in your life, and ﬁt you for the courts of
          glory. But if brain and nerve and muscle are all employed in the service of self, you are not making God and
          heaven the ﬁrst consideration of your life. It is impossible to be weaving the graces of Christ into your
          character while you are putting all your energies on the side of the world.</p>
      <p>You may be successful in heaping up treasure on the earth, for the glory of self; but “where your treasure is,
          there will your heart be also” (Matthew 6:21). Eternal considerations will be made of secondary importance.
          You may take part in the outward forms of worship; but your service will be an abomination to the God of
          heaven. You cannot serve God and mammon. You will either yield your heart and put your will on the side of
          God, or you will give your energies to the service of the world. God will accept no <nobr>half-hearted</nobr>
          service.</p>
      <p>“The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light”
          (Luke 11:34). If the eye is single, if it is directed heavenward, the light of heaven will ﬁll the soul, and
          earthly things will appear insigniﬁcant and uninviting. The purpose of the heart will be changed, and the
          admonition of Jesus will be heeded. You will lay up your treasure in heaven. Your thoughts will be ﬁxed upon
          the great rewards of eternity. All your plans will be made in reference to the future, immortal life. You will
          be drawn toward your treasure. You will not study your worldly interest; but in all your pursuits the silent
          inquiry will be “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (Acts <nobr>9:6).—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January
          24, 1888.</p>
