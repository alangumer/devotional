    <h1>Complete in Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power. Colossians
          2:10.</strong></p>
      <p>You cannot enter heaven with any deformity or imperfection of character, and you must be ﬁtted for heaven now
          in this probationary life. If you would enter the abode of the righteous when Christ shall come, you must have
          the deep movings of the Spirit of God, that you may have an individual experience, and be complete in Him who
          is the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Through the power of the righteousness of Christ, we are to depart from
          all iniquity. There must be a living connection of the soul with its Redeemer. The channel of communication
          must be open continually between man and his God, that the soul may grow in grace and in the knowledge of the
          Lord.</p>
      <p>But how many do not pray. They feel under condemnation for sin, and they think they must not come to God until
          they have done something to merit His favor, or until God has forgotten about their transgressions. They say,
          “I cannot hold up holy hands before God without wrath or doubting, and therefore I cannot come.” So they
          remain away from Christ, and are committing sin all the time in so doing, for without Him you can do nothing
          but evil.</p>
      <p>Just as soon as you commit sin, you should ﬂee to the throne of grace, and tell Jesus all about it. You should
          be ﬁlled with sorrow for sin, because through sin you have weakened your own spirituality, grieved the
          heavenly angels, and wounded and bruised the loving heart of your Redeemer. When you have asked Jesus in
          contrition of soul for His forgiveness, believe that He has forgiven you. Do not doubt His divine mercy, or
          refuse the comfort of His inﬁnite love.</p>
      <p>If your child had disobeyed you, and committed wrong against you, and that child should come with a breaking
          heart to ask forgiveness, you know what you would do. You know how quickly you would draw your child to your
          heart, and assure him that your love was unchanged, and his transgressions forgiven. Are you more merciful
          than your merciful heavenly Father, who so loved the world that He “gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
          believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”? (John 3:16). You should go to God as children
          go to their <nobr>parents.—The</nobr> Bible Echo, February 1, 1892.</p>
