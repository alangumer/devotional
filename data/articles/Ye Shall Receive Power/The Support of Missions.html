      <p><strong>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying
          up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
          1 Timothy 6:18, 19.</strong></p>
      <p>The mission of the church of Christ is to save perishing sinners. It is to make known the love of God to men,
          and to win them to Christ by the efﬁcacy of that love. The truth for this time must be carried into the dark
          corners of the earth, and this work may begin at home.</p>
      <p>The followers of Christ should not live selﬁsh lives; but, imbued with the Spirit of Christ, they should work
          in harmony with Him.</p>
      <p>He has given His people a plan for raising sums sufﬁcient to make the enterprise <nobr>self-sustaining.</nobr>
          God’s plan in the tithing system is beautiful in its simplicity and equality. All may take hold of it in faith
          and courage, for it is of divine origin. In it are combined simplicity and utility, and it does not require
          depth of learning to understand and execute it.</p>
      <p>All may feel that they can act a part in carrying forward the precious work of salvation. Every man, woman, and
          youth may become a treasurer for God; and there would be no want of means with which to carry forward the
          great work of sounding the last message of warning to the [world].</p>
      <p>The treasury will be full if all adopt this system, and the contributors will be left none the poorer. Through
          every investment made they will become more wedded to the cause of present truth. They will be “laying up in
          store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life” (1
          Timothy 6:19).</p>
      <p>If the plan of systematic benevolence was adopted by every individual and fully carried out, there would be a
          constant supply in the treasury. The income would ﬂow in like a steady stream constantly supplied by
          overﬂowing springs of <nobr>benevolence.—East</nobr> Michigan Banner, January 18, 1905.</p>
