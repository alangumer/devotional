      <p><strong>Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by
          ﬁre; and the ﬁre shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. 1 Corinthians 3:13.</strong></p>
      <p>The end of all things is at hand. God is moving upon every mind that is open to receive the impressions of His
          Holy Spirit. He is sending out messengers that they may give the warning in every locality. God is testing the
          devotion of His churches and their willingness to render obedience to the Spirit’s guidance. Knowledge is to
          be increased. The messengers of heaven are to be seen running to and fro, seeking in every possible way to
          warn the people of the coming judgments, and presenting the glad tidings of salvation through our Lord Jesus
          Christ. The standard of righteousness is to be exalted.</p>
      <p>The Spirit of God is moving upon men’s hearts, and those who respond to His inﬂuence will become lights in the
          world. Everywhere they are seen going forth to communicate to others the light they have received as they did
          after the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. And as they let their light shine, they receive
          more and more of the Spirit’s power. The earth is lighted with the glory of God.</p>
      <p>But, oh, sad picture! Those who do not submit to the inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit soon lose the blessings
          received when they acknowledged the truth as from heaven. They fall into a cold, spiritless formality; they
          lose their interest in perishing souls: they have “left their ﬁrst love.” And Christ says unto them, “Remember
          therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the ﬁrst works; or else I will come unto thee
          quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent” (Revelation 2:5). He will take
          His Holy Spirit from the church, and give [the Spirit] to others who will appreciate Him.</p>
      <p>There is no greater evidence that those who have received great light do not appreciate that light, than is
          given by their refusal to let their light shine upon those who are in darkness, and devoting their time and
          energies in celebrating forms and <nobr>ceremonies.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 16, 1895.</p>
