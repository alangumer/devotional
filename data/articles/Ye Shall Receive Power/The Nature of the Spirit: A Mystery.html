    <h1>The Nature of the Spirit: A Mystery</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him:
          but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. John 14:17.</strong></p>
      <p>It is not essential for us to be able to deﬁne just what the Holy Spirit is. Christ tells us that the Spirit is
          the Comforter, “the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father.” It is plainly declared regarding the
          Holy Spirit that, in His work of guiding men into all truth, “He shall not speak of himself” (John 15:26;
          16:13).</p>
      <p>The nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot explain it, because the Lord has not revealed it to
          them. Men having fanciful views may bring together passages of Scripture and put a human construction on them,
          but the acceptance of these views will not strengthen the church. Regarding such mysteries, which are too deep
          for human understanding, silence is golden.</p>
      <p>The ofﬁce of the Holy Spirit is distinctly speciﬁed in the words of Christ: “When he is come, he will reprove
          the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment” (John 16:8). It is the Holy Spirit that convicts of
          sin. If the sinner responds to the quickening inﬂuence of the Spirit, he will be brought to repentance and
          aroused to the importance of obeying the divine requirements.</p>
      <p>To the repentant sinner, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, the Holy Spirit reveals the Lamb of God
          that taketh away the sin of the world. “He shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you,” Christ said.
          “He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you”
          (John 16:14; 14:26).</p>
      <p>The Spirit is given as a regenerating agency, to make effectual the salvation wrought by the death of our
          Redeemer. The Spirit is constantly seeking to draw the attention of men to the great offering that was made on
          the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the world the love of God, and to open to the convicted soul the precious
          things of the <nobr>Scriptures.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 51, 52.</p>
