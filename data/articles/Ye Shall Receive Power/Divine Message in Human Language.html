    <h1>Divine Message in Human Language</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
          hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
          made the worlds. Hebrews 1:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>The Bible is not given to us in grand superhuman language. Jesus, in order to reach man where he is, took
          humanity. The Bible must be given in the language of men. Everything that is human is imperfect. Different
          meanings are expressed by the same word; there is not one word for each distinct idea. The Bible was given for
          practical purposes.</p>
      <p>The stamps of minds are different. All do not understand expressions and statements alike. Some understand the
          statements of the Scriptures to suit their own particular minds and cases. Prepossessions, prejudices, and
          passions have a strong inﬂuence to darken the understanding and confuse the mind even in reading the words of
          Holy Writ....</p>
      <p>The Bible is written by inspired men, but it is not God’s mode of thought and expression. It is that of
          humanity. God, as a writer, is not represented. Men will often say such an expression is not like God. But God
          has not put Himself in words, in logic, in rhetoric, on trial in the Bible. The writers of the Bible were
          God’s penmen, not His pen. Look at the different writers.</p>
      <p>It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the
          man’s words or his expressions but on the man himself, who, under the inﬂuence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued
          with thoughts. But the words receive the impress of the individual mind. The divine mind is diffused. The
          divine mind and will is combined with the human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are the Word of
          <nobr>God.—Selected</nobr> Messages 1:20, 21.</p>
