    <h1>Writers Impressed by Different Aspects</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved
          by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter 1:21.</strong></p>
      <p>As presented through different individuals [in the Bible], the truth is brought out in its varied aspects. One
          writer is more strongly impressed with one phase of the subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with
          his experience or with his power of perception and appreciation; another seizes upon a different phase; and
          each, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, presents what is most forcibly impressed upon his own
          <nobr>mind—a</nobr> different aspect of the truth in each, but a perfect harmony through all. And the truths
          thus revealed unite to form a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men in all the circumstances and
          experiences of life.</p>
      <p>God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world by human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy
          Spirit, qualiﬁed men and enabled them to do this work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to speak
          and what to write. The treasure was entrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, nonetheless, from heaven. The
          testimony is conveyed through the imperfect expression of human language, yet it is the testimony of God; and
          the obedient, believing child of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace and truth.</p>
      <p>In His Word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be
          accepted as an authoritative, infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the
          revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. “Every scripture inspired of God is also proﬁtable for
          teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness; that the man of God may be
          complete, furnished completely unto every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17, <nobr>RV.).—The</nobr> Great
          Controversy, vi, vii.</p>
