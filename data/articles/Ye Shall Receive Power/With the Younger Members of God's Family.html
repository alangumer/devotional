    <h1>With the Younger Members of God’s Family</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw
          nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them. Ecclesiastes 12:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Every blessing the Father has provided for those of more mature experience has been provided for children and
          youth through Jesus Christ. When the Lord sees the youth studying the life and lessons of Christ, He gives His
          angels charge over them, to keep them in all their ways, as He gave His angels charge over Jesus, His beloved
          Son. The angels attended Jesus when He lived upon earth under the guidance of God’s Holy Spirit, doing His
          heavenly Father’s will, that He might give a correct sample of character, that might be an example to children
          and youth. He desired that, in every action of their lives, they should do those things of which God could
          approve. He knew that every good work, every deed of kindness, every act of obedience to father and mother,
          would be registered in the books of heaven.</p>
      <p>Those who honor their parents would reap a reward in the fulﬁllment of the promise that they should live long
          upon the land which the Lord their God giveth them. Children are to continue in <nobr>well-doing,</nobr>
          praying that through the merits of Jesus, the Lord will give them His grace, His mind, and His beauty of
          character. God has withheld no blessing that is necessary for shaping the character of children and youth
          after the divine pattern given them in the youth of Jesus. They are to ask for the graces of His character, in
          simple, trusting faith, and in the name of Jesus, just as a son asks a favor of his earthly parent.</p>
      <p>Dear children and youth, you need a new heart. Ask God for this. He says, “A new heart also will I give you”
          (Ezekiel 36:26). When you have asked according to His will, doubt not that you will receive; for whatever God
          has promised, He will fulﬁll. If you come with true contrition of soul, you need not feel that you are at all
          presumptuous in asking for what God has promised. Presumption is asking for things to gratify selﬁsh
          inclination; for human enjoyment in earthly things. But when you ask for the spiritual blessings you so much
          need in order that you may perfect a character after Christ’s likeness, the Lord assures you that you are
          asking according to a promise that will be <nobr>veriﬁed.—The</nobr> Youth’s Instructor, August 23, 1894.</p>
