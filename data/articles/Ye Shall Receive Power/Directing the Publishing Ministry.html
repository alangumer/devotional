    <h1>Directing the Publishing Ministry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Isaiah
          60:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Our publishing houses were erected to do a work for the Lord, to send heavenly light to all parts of the world,
          to bring precious souls into the fold. Let the [publishing house] ofﬁce be a missionary plant to do a work for
          the Master in the conversion of souls. Work, and watch, and pray for souls as they that must give an account.
          This year try the Lord’s prescribed remedy for evil. Let every man do that which the Lord requires him to do,
          looking unto Jesus, who is the owner of every soul.</p>
      <p>Let the workers who have to act a part in this ﬁrm remember that God calls them to be a convention of Christian
          workers, a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. Let small companies assemble together in the evening
          or early morning to study the Bible for themselves. Let them have a season of prayer that they may be
          strengthened and enlightened and sanctiﬁed by the Holy Spirit. This is the work Christ wants to have done in
          the heart of everyone who is engaged in any department of the publishing work. If you will do this, a great
          blessing will come to you from the One who gave His whole life to service, the One who redeemed you by His own
          life.</p>
      <p>You must have the power of the Holy Spirit, else you cannot be an overcomer. What testimonies you should bear
          of the loving acquaintance you have made with your fellow workers in these precious seasons when seeking the
          blessing of God. Let each tell his experience in simple words. This will bring more comfort and joy to the
          soul than all the pleasant instruments of song that can be produced in the Tabernacle. Let Christ come into
          your hearts.</p>
      <p>The work of every believer is aggressive. It is a daily warfare. Christ is saying to the managers and workers
          in the ofﬁce, “Ye are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10). Think it; speak it; act it. Heaven is just next door. Open
          the door heavenward and close the door earthward. God is calling the workers in every department of the ofﬁce.
          Will you hear His voice and open the door of the heart to Jesus? Will you love Him who gave His life for
          <nobr>you?—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 12:46, 47.</p>
