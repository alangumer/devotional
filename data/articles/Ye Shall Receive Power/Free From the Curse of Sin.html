    <h1>Free From the Curse of Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the
          end everlasting life. Romans 6:22.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord would have His people sound in the <nobr>faith—not</nobr> ignorant of the great salvation so
          abundantly provided for them. They are not to look forward, thinking that at some future time a great work is
          to be done for them; for the work is now complete. The believer is not called upon to make his peace with God;
          he never has nor ever can do this. He is to accept Christ as his peace, for with Christ is God and peace.
          Christ made an end of sin, bearing its heavy curse in His own body on the tree, and He hath taken away the
          curse from all those who believe in Him as a personal Saviour. He makes an end of the controlling power of sin
          in the heart, and the life and character of the believer testify to the genuine character of the grace of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>To those that ask Him, Jesus imparts the Holy Spirit; for it is necessary that every believer should be
          delivered from pollution, as well as from the curse and condemnation of the law. Through the work of the Holy
          Spirit, the sanctiﬁcation of the truth, the believer becomes ﬁtted for the courts of heaven; for Christ works
          within us, and His righteousness is upon us. Without this no soul will be entitled to heaven. We would not
          enjoy heaven unless qualiﬁed for its holy atmosphere by the inﬂuence of the Spirit and the righteousness of
          Christ.</p>
      <p>In order to be candidates for heaven we must meet the requirement of the law: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
          with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour
          as thyself” (Luke 10:27). We can do this only as we grasp by faith the righteousness of Christ. By beholding
          Jesus we receive a living, expanding principle in the heart, and the Holy Spirit carries on the work, and the
          believer advances from grace to grace, from strength to strength, from character to character. He conforms to
          the image of Christ, until in spiritual growth he attains unto the measure of the full stature in Christ
          Jesus. Thus Christ makes an end of the curse of sin, and sets the believing soul free from its action and
          <nobr>effect.—Selected</nobr> Messages 1:394, 395.</p>
