    <h1>Tongues: To Preach the Gospel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what
          is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
          none of them is without signiﬁcation. Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him
          that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. 1 Corinthians
          <nobr>14:9-11.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Ministers who labor in word and doctrine should be thorough workmen, and should present the truth in its
          purity, yet with simplicity. They should feed the ﬂock with clean provender, thoroughly winnowed. There are
          wandering stars professing to be ministers sent of God who are preaching the Sabbath from place to place, but
          who have truth mixed up with error and are throwing out their mass of discordant views to the people. Satan
          has pushed them in to disgust intelligent and sensible unbelievers.</p>
      <p>Some of these have much to say upon the gifts and are often especially exercised. They give themselves up to
          wild, excitable feelings and make unintelligible sounds which they call the gift of tongues, and a certain
          class seem to be charmed with these strange manifestations. A strange spirit rules with this class, which
          would bear down and run over anyone who would reprove them. God’s Spirit is not in the work and does not
          attend such workmen. They have another spirit. Still, such preachers have success among a certain class. But
          this will greatly increase the labor of those servants whom God shall send, who are qualiﬁed to present before
          the people the Sabbath and the gifts in their proper light, and whose inﬂuence and example are worthy of
          imitation.</p>
      <p>The truth should be presented in a manner which will make it attractive to the intelligent mind. We are not
          understood as a people, but are looked upon as poor, <nobr>weak-minded,</nobr> low, and degraded. Then how
          important for all who teach, and all who believe the truth, to be so affected by its sanctifying inﬂuence that
          their consistent, elevated lives shall show unbelievers that they have been deceived in this people. How
          important that the cause of truth be stripped of everything like a false and fanatical excitement, that the
          truth may stand upon its own merits, revealing its native purity and exalted
          <nobr>character.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 1:414, 415.</p>
