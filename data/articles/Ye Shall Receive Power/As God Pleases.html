    <h1>As God Pleases</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and said unto him, Art
          thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do
          know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye
          believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? John <nobr>3:9-12.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>At inﬁnite cost provision has been made for men to reach perfection of Christian character. Those who have been
          impressed by the Holy Scriptures as the voice of God, and desire to follow its teachings, are to be daily
          learning, daily receiving spiritual fervor and power, which have been provided for every true believer in the
          gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is a free, working, independent agency. The God of heaven uses His Spirit as it pleases Him:
          and human minds, human judgment, and human methods can no more set boundaries to its working, or prescribe the
          channel through which it shall operate, than they can say to the wind, “I bid you to blow in a certain
          direction, and to conduct yourself in such and such a manner.” As the wind moves in its force, bending and
          breaking the lofty trees in its path, so the Holy Spirit inﬂuences human hearts, and no ﬁnite man can
          circumscribe its work....</p>
      <p>Nicodemus was not willing to admit the truth, because he could not understand all that was connected with the
          operation of the power of God; and yet he accepted the facts of nature, although he could not explain or even
          comprehend them. Like other men of all ages, he was looking to forms and precise ceremonies as more essential
          to religion than the deep movings of the Spirit of God....</p>
      <p>The fountain of the heart must be puriﬁed before the streams can become pure. There is no safety for one who
          has merely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Christian’s life is not a modiﬁcation or improvement of
          the old life, but a transformation of the nature. There is a death to sin and self, and a new life altogether.
          This change can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy <nobr>Spirit.—The</nobr> Signs of
          the Times, March 8, 1910.</p>
