    <h1>Even Children May Share Their Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in
          the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest
          thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and
          sucklings thou hast perfected praise? Matthew 21:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>The standard of truth may be raised by humble men and women; and the youth, and even children, may be a
          blessing to others, by revealing what the truth has done for them. God will use the most feeble instruments if
          they are wholly submitted to Him. He can work through them to reach souls to whom the minister could not
          obtain access. There are the highways and byways to be searched. With your Bible in your hand, with your heart
          warm and glowing with the love of God, you may go out and tell others your experience; you may make known to
          them the truth that has impressed your heart, praying with faith that God will make your efforts successful in
          their salvation. Communicate light, and you will have more light to communicate. Thus you may become laborers
          together with God.</p>
      <p>God desires that His children shall make use of all their powers, that in working to bless others, they may
          grow strong in the strength of Jesus. You may not be learned; you may not be thought capable of doing a great
          work for God; but there are things which you can do. You can let your light shine forth to others....</p>
      <p>Everyone may have an understanding of the truth, and exert an inﬂuence for good. Then go to work, my brethren
          and sisters. Gain an experience by working for others. You may make mistakes; but this is not more than the
          most intelligent, and those in positions of trust, have done again and again. You will not always meet with
          success; but you can never know the result of humble, disinterested effort to help those who are in darkness.
          Through the agency of the Holy Spirit, you may win souls from error to truth, and in so doing your own souls
          will be ﬁlled with the love of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 12, 1897.</p>
