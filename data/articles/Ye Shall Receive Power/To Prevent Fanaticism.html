    <h1>To Prevent Fanaticism</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the ﬂock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you
          overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after
          my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the ﬂock. Also of your own selves shall men
          arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Acts <nobr>20:28-30.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Fanaticism will appear in the very midst of us. Deceptions will come, and of such a character that if it were
          possible they would mislead the very elect. If marked inconsistencies and untruthful utterances were apparent
          in these manifestations, the words from the lips of the great Teacher would not be needed. It is because of
          the many and varied dangers that would arise, that this warning is given.</p>
      <p>The reason why I hang out the danger signal is that through the enlightenment of the Spirit of God I can see
          that which my brethren do not discern. It may not be a positive necessity for me to point out all these
          peculiar phases of deception that they will need to guard against. It is enough for me to tell you, Be on your
          guard; and as faithful sentinels keep the ﬂock of God from accepting indiscriminately all that professes to be
          communicated to them from the Lord. If we work to create an excitement of feeling, we shall have all we want,
          and more than we can possibly know how to manage. Calmly and clearly “Preach the Word.” We must not regard it
          as our work to create an excitement.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit of God alone can create a healthy enthusiasm. Let God work, and let the human agent walk softly
          before Him, watching, waiting, praying, looking unto Jesus every moment, led and controlled by the precious
          Spirit, which is light and <nobr>life.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:16, 17.</p>
