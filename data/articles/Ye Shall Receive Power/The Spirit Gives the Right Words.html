    <h1>The Spirit Gives the Right Words</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. Matthew
          10:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Of all the gifts which God has given to man, none is more precious than the gift of speech, if it is sanctiﬁed
          by the Holy Spirit. It is with the tongue that we convince and persuade: with it we offer prayer and praise to
          God, and with it we convey rich thoughts of the Redeemer’s love. Those who are ﬁtted to enlighten minds will
          often have opportunity to read from the Bible or from books which teach the truth, and thus bring the evidence
          to enlighten souls.</p>
      <p>When the Lord’s voice calls, “Whom shall I send? and who will go for us?” the divine Spirit puts it into hearts
          to respond, “Here am I; send me” (Isaiah 6:8). But bear in mind that the live coal from the altar must ﬁrst
          touch your lips. Then the words you speak will be wise and holy words. Then you will have wisdom to know what
          to say and what to leave unsaid. You will not try to reveal your smartness as theologians. You will be careful
          not to arouse a combative spirit or excite prejudice, by introducing indiscriminately all the points of our
          faith. You will ﬁnd enough to talk about that will not excite opposition, but that will open the heart to
          desire a deeper knowledge of God’s Word.</p>
      <p>The Lord desires you to be soul winners; therefore, while you should not force doctrinal points upon the
          people, you should “be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
          is in you with meekness and fear” (1 Peter 3:15). Why fear? Fear lest your words should savor of
          <nobr>self-importance,</nobr> lest unadvised words be spoken, lest the words and manner should not be after
          Christ’s likeness. Connect ﬁrmly with Christ, and present the truth as it is in Him. Hearts cannot fail to be
          touched by the story of the atonement.</p>
      <p>As you learn the meekness and lowliness of Christ, you will know what you should say to the people; for the
          Holy Spirit will tell you what words you ought to speak. Those who realize the necessity of keeping the heart
          under the control of the Holy Spirit will be enabled to sow seed that will spring up into eternal life. This
          is the work of the gospel <nobr>evangelist.—(Australasian)</nobr> Union Conference Record, July 1, 1902.</p>
