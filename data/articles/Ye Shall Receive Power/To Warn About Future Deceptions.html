    <h1>To Warn About Future Deceptions</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you,
          who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
          themselves swift destruction. 2 Peter 2:1.</strong></p>
      <p>In the future, deception of every kind is to arise, and we want solid ground for our feet. We want solid
          pillars for the building. Not one pin is to be removed from that which the Lord has established. The enemy
          will bring in false theories, such as the doctrine that there is no sanctuary. This is one of the points on
          which there will be a departing from the faith. Where shall we ﬁnd safety unless it be in the truths that the
          Lord has been giving for the last ﬁfty years?</p>
      <p>I want to tell you that Christ lives. He makes intercession for us, and He will save everyone who will come to
          Him in faith and obey His directions. But remember that He does not want you to give your energies to
          criticism of your brethren. Attend to the salvation of your own soul. Do the work God has given you. You will
          ﬁnd so much to do that you will have no inclination to criticize someone else. Use the talent of speech to
          help and bless. If you do the work God has given you, you will have a message to bear, and you will understand
          what is meant by the sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit.</p>
      <p>Do not think that Satan is not doing anything. Do not think that his army is passive. He and his agencies are
          on the ground today. We are to put on the whole armor of God. Having done all, we are to stand, meeting
          principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places. And if we have on the heavenly armor, we
          shall ﬁnd that the assaults of the enemy will not have power over us. Angels of God will be round about us to
          protect us. I have the assurance of God that thus it will be.</p>
      <p>In the name of the Lord God of Israel I ask you to come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord
          against the mighty. If you do this, you will have on your side a strong Helper, a personal Saviour. You will
          be covered with the shield of providence. God will make a way for you, so that you will never be overtaken by
          the <nobr>enemy.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, May 25, 1905.</p>
