    <h1>Separating the True From the Fictitious</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they
          heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and
          shall be turned unto fables. 2 Timothy 4:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>Much is being said regarding the impartation of the Holy Spirit, and by some this is being so interpreted that
          it is an injury to the churches. Eternal life is the receiving of the living elements in the Scriptures and
          doing the will of God. This is eating the ﬂesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. To those who do this,
          life and immortality are brought to light through the gospel, for God’s Word is verity and truth, spirit and
          life. It is the privilege of all who believe in Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour to feed on the Word of
          God. The Holy Spirit’s inﬂuence renders that Word, the Bible, an immortal truth, which to the prayerful
          searcher gives spiritual sinew and muscle.</p>
      <p>“Search the scriptures,” Christ declared, “for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
          testify of me” (John 5:39). Those who dig beneath the surface discover the hidden gems of truth. The Holy
          Spirit is present with the earnest searcher. His illumination shines upon the Word, stamping the truth upon
          the mind with a new, fresh importance. The searcher is ﬁlled with a sense of peace and joy never before felt.
          The preciousness of truth is realized as never before. A new, heavenly light shines upon the Word,
          illuminating it as though every letter were tinged with gold. God Himself has spoken to the mind and heart,
          making the Word spirit and life.</p>
      <p>Every true searcher of the Word lifts his heart to God, imploring the aid of the Spirit. And he soon discovers
          that which carries him above all the ﬁctitious statements of the <nobr>would-be</nobr> teacher, whose weak,
          tottering theories are not sustained by the Word of the living God. These theories were invented by men who
          had not learned the ﬁrst great lesson, that God’s Spirit and life are in His Word. If they had received in the
          heart the eternal element contained in the Word of God, they would see how tame and expressionless are all
          efforts to get something new to create a sensation. They need to learn the very ﬁrst principles of the Word of
          <nobr>God.—Selected</nobr> Messages 2:38, 39.</p>
