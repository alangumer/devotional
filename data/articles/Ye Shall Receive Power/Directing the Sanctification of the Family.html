    <h1>Directing the Sanctiﬁcation of the Family</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. Proverbs
          22:6.</strong></p>
      <p>I appeal to parents to prepare themselves and their children to unite with the family above. Get ready, for
          Christ’s sake, get ready to meet your Lord in peace. Begin to work in your family on right lines. Get down to
          the root of the matter. Bring the truth into your homes, to sanctify and purify them. Do not keep it in the
          outer court. How blind many professing Christians are to their own interests! How utterly they fail to see
          what Christ would do for them were He admitted into their homes. Let Christians work as earnestly to win the
          crown of life as worldlings work to win earthly advantages, and the church of God will certainly move forward
          with power....</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit produces actions that are in harmony with the law of God. The regenerating work of the Spirit
          will be seen in families where painstaking efforts are put forth to manifest kindness, patience, and love.
          Almighty power is at work, preparing minds and hearts to submit to the molding inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit,
          leading parents to sanctify themselves, that their children also may be sanctiﬁed.</p>
      <p>The home in which the members are polite, courteous Christians exerts a <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> inﬂuence for
          good. Other families will mark the results attained by such a home, and will follow the example set, in their
          turn guarding the home against satanic inﬂuences.</p>
      <p>The angels of God will often visit the home in which the will of God bears sway. Under the power of divine
          grace such a home becomes a place of refreshing to worn, weary pilgrims. By watchfully guarding, self is kept
          from asserting itself. Correct habits are formed. There is a careful recognition of the rights of others. The
          faith that works by love and puriﬁes the soul stands at the helm, presiding over the whole household. Under
          the hallowed inﬂuence of such a home, the principle of brotherhood laid down in the Word of God is more widely
          recognized and <nobr>obeyed.—The</nobr> Southern Watchman, January 19, 1904.</p>
