    <h1>No Speciﬁc Time</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. Mark 13:33.</strong></p>
      <p>God grant that His converting power may be felt throughout this large assembly. Oh, that the power of God may
          rest upon the people. What we need is daily piety. We need to search the Scriptures daily, to pray earnestly
          that by the power of the Holy Spirit God may ﬁt every one of us up to work in our place in His vineyard. No
          one is prepared to educate and strengthen the church unless he has received the gift of the Holy Spirit. No
          minister is prepared to labor intelligently for the salvation of souls, unless he is endowed by the Holy
          Spirit, unless he is feeding on Christ, and has an intense hatred of sin....</p>
      <p>I have no speciﬁc time of which to speak when the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will take
          <nobr>place—when</nobr> the mighty angel will come down from heaven, and unite with the third angel in closing
          up the work for this world; my message is that our only safety is in being ready for the heavenly refreshing,
          having our lamps trimmed and burning. Christ has told us to watch; “for in such an hour as ye think not the
          Son of man cometh” (Matthew 24:44). “Watch and pray” is the charge that is given us by our Redeemer. Day by
          day we are to seek the enlightenment of the Spirit of God, that it may do its ofﬁce work upon the soul and
          character. Oh, how much time has been wasted through giving attention to triﬂing things. Repent and be
          converted, that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
          Lord.</p>
      <p>We now call upon you to give yourselves to the service of God. Too long have you given your powers to the
          service of Satan, and have been slaves to his will. God calls upon you to behold the glory of His character,
          that by beholding, you may become changed into His image.... Jesus came to reveal to the world the love
          and</p>
      <p>goodness of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 29, 1892.</p>
