      <p><strong>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all
          ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. Acts 4:31.</strong></p>
      <p>The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the “former rain”; and glorious was the result.
          But the “latter rain” will be still more abundant. What is the promise to those living in these last days?
          “Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double unto
          thee” (Zechariah 9:12). “Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright
          clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the ﬁeld” (Zechariah 10:1).</p>
      <p>Christ declares that the divine inﬂuence of the Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. But by some
          this promise is not appreciated as it should be; its fulﬁllment is not realized as it might be. Learning,
          talents, eloquence, every natural or acquired endowment, may be possessed; but without the presence of the
          Spirit of God, no heart will be touched, no sinner won to Christ. When His disciples are connected with
          Christ, when the gifts of the Spirit are theirs, even the poorest and most ignorant of them will have a power
          that will tell upon hearts. God makes them the channel for the outworking of the highest inﬂuence in the
          universe.</p>
      <p>As the divine <nobr>endowment—the</nobr> power of the Holy <nobr>Spirit—was</nobr> given to the disciples, so
          it will today be given to all who seek aright. This power alone is able to make us wise unto salvation, and to
          ﬁt us for the courts above. Christ wants to give us a blessing that will make us holy. “These things have I
          spoken unto you,” He says, “that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full” (John 15:11).
          Joy in the Holy Spirit is <nobr>health-giving,</nobr><nobr>life-giving.</nobr> In giving us His Spirit, God
          gives us <nobr>Himself—a</nobr> fountain of divine inﬂuences, to give health and life to the
          <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, March 15, 1910.</p>
