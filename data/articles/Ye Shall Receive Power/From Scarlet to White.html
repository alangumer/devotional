    <h1>From Scarlet to White</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
          white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Isaiah 1:18.</strong></p>
      <p>When you remember that Christ has paid the price of His own blood for your redemption and for the redemption of
          others, you will be moved to catch the bright rays of His righteousness, that you may shed them upon the
          pathway of those around you. You are not to look to the future, thinking that at some distant day you are to
          be made holy; it is now that you are to be sanctiﬁed through the truth. The prophet exhorts: “Seek ye the Lord
          while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous
          man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he
          will abundantly pardon” (Isaiah 55:6, 7). And Jesus said, “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
          Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ... unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Acts
          1:8).</p>
      <p>We are to receive the Holy Ghost. We have had an idea that this gift of God was not for such as we are, that
          the gift of the Holy Spirit was too sacred, too holy for us; but the Holy Spirit is the Comforter that Christ
          promised to His disciples to bring all things to their remembrance, whatsoever He had said unto them. Then let
          us cease to look to ourselves, but look to Him from whom all virtue comes. No one can make himself better, but
          we are to come to Jesus as we are, earnestly desiring to be cleansed from every spot and stain of sin, and
          receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. We are not to doubt His mercy, and say, “I do not know whether I shall be
          saved or not.” By living faith we must lay hold of His promise, for He has said, “Though your sins be as
          scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”</p>
      <p>We are to be witnesses for Christ, reﬂecting upon others the light which the Lord permits to shine upon us. We
          are to be as faithful soldiers marching under the bloodstained banner of Prince <nobr>Emmanuel.—The</nobr>
          Signs of the Times, April 4, 1892.</p>
