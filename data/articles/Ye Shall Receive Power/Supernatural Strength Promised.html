    <h1>Supernatural Strength Promised</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the ﬂesh,
          but after the Spirit. Romans 8:1.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit was promised to be with those who were wrestling for victory, demonstrating the power of might
          by endowing the human agent with supernatural strength, and instructing the ignorant in the mysteries of the
          kingdom of God. The Holy Spirit is to be our helper. Of what avail would it have been to us that the
          <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son of God had humbled Himself, endured the temptations of the wily foe, and
          wrestled with him during His entire life on earth, and died, the just for the unjust, that humanity might not
          perish, if the Spirit had not been given as a constant working, regenerating agent to make effectual in our
          cases what had been wrought by the world’s Redeemer?</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit implanted in the disciples enabled them to stand ﬁrmly against idolatry, and to exalt the Lord
          alone.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit guided the pens of the sacred historians that the record of the precious words and works of
          Christ might be presented to the world. The Holy Spirit is constantly at work seeking to draw the attention of
          men to the great sacriﬁce made upon the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the world the love of God to man, and
          to open to the convicted soul the precious promises in the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>It is the Holy Spirit that brings to the darkened minds the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness. It is the
          Holy Spirit that makes men’s hearts burn within them with an awakened intelligence of the truths of eternity.
          It is the Holy Spirit that presents before the mind the moral standard of righteousness and convinces of sin.
          It is the Holy Spirit that produces godly sorrow which worketh repentance that needeth not to be repented of,
          and inspires faith in Him who alone can save from all sin. It is the Holy Spirit that works to transform
          character by withdrawing the affections of men from those things which are temporal and perishable, and ﬁxing
          them upon the immortal inheritance, the eternal substance which is imperishable. The Holy Spirit
          <nobr>re-creates,</nobr> reﬁnes, and sanctiﬁes the human agents, that they may become members of the royal
          family, children of the heavenly <nobr>King.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, April 17, 1893.</p>
