    <h1>In Times of Trial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our inﬁrmities; but was in
          all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 4:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ dwells in him who receives Him by faith. Though trials may come upon the soul, yet the Lord’s presence
          will be with us. The burning bush in which was the Lord’s presence did not consume away. The ﬁre did not
          extinguish a ﬁber of the branches. Thus will it be with the feeble human agent who puts his trust in Christ.
          The furnace ﬁre of temptation may burn, persecution and trial may come, but only the dross will be consumed.
          The gold will shine brighter because of the process of puriﬁcation.</p>
      <p>Greater is He that is in the heart of the faithful, than he that controls the hearts of unbelievers. Complain
          not bitterly of the trial which comes upon you, but let your eyes be directed to Christ, who has clothed His
          divinity with humanity, in order that we may understand how great His interest in us since He has identiﬁed
          Himself with suffering humanity. He tasted the cup of human sorrow, He was afﬂicted in all our afﬂictions, He
          was made perfect through suffering, tempted in all points like as humanity is tempted, in order that He might
          succor those who are in temptation.</p>
      <p>He says, “I will make a man more precious than ﬁne gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir” (Isaiah
          13:12). He will make a man precious by abiding with Him, by giving unto him the Holy Spirit. He says, “If ye
          then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father
          give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” (Luke 11:13).</p>
      <p>The Lord has instructed us to call God our Father, to regard Him as the fountain of paternal affection, the
          source of the love that has been ﬂowing from century to century through the channel of the human heart. All
          the pity, compassion, and love which have been manifested in the earth have emanated from the throne of God,
          and, compared to the love that dwells in His heart, are as a fountain to an ocean. His love is perpetually
          ﬂowing forth to make the weak strong, to make the fainthearted ﬁrm, and give moral courage to the wavering.
          God works through Christ, and man may come unto the Father in the name of the Son. Our science and our song is
          “Hear what the Lord hath done for my <nobr>soul.”—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, March 5, 1896.</p>
