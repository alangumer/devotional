      <p><strong>And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for
          these words are true and faithful. Revelation 21:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Sister White is not the originator of these books. They contain the instruction that during her lifework God
          has been giving her. They contain the precious, comforting light that God has graciously given His servant to
          be given to the world. From their pages this light is to shine into the hearts of men and women, leading them
          to the Saviour. The Lord has declared that these books are to be scattered throughout the world. There is in
          them truth which to the receiver is a savor of life unto life. They are silent witnesses for God.</p>
      <p>In the past they have been the means in His hands of convicting and converting many souls. Many have read them
          with eager expectation, and, by reading them, have been led to see the efﬁcacy of Christ’s atonement, and to
          trust in its power. They have been led to commit the keeping of their souls to their Creator, waiting and
          hoping for the coming of the Saviour to take His loved ones to their eternal home. In the future, these books
          are to make the gospel plain to many others, revealing to them the way of salvation.</p>
      <p>The Lord has sent His people much instruction, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a
          little. Little heed is given to the Bible, and the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women to the
          greater light. Oh, how much good would be accomplished if the books containing this light were read with a
          determination to carry out the principles they contain! There would be a thousandfold greater vigilance, a
          thousandfold more <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and resolute effort. And many more would now be rejoicing in the
          light of present truth.</p>
      <p>My brethren and sisters, work earnestly to circulate these books. Put your hearts into this work, and the
          blessing of God will be with you. Go forth in faith, praying that God will prepare hearts to receive the
          light. Be pleasant and courteous. Show by a consistent course that you are true Christians. Walk and work in
          the light of heaven, and your path will be as the path of the just, shining more and more unto the perfect
          <nobr>day.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 20, 1903.</p>
