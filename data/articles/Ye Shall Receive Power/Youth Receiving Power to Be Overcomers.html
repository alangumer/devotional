    <h1>Youth Receiving Power to Be Overcomers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in
          the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will
          bring thee into judgment. Ecclesiastes 11:9.</strong></p>
      <p>In surrendering ourselves to God, we reap great advantages; for if we have weaknesses of character, as we all
          have, we unite ourselves to One who is mighty to save. Our ignorance will be united to inﬁnite wisdom, our
          frailty to enduring might, and, like Jacob, we may each become a prince with God. Connected with the Lord God
          of Israel, we shall have power from above which will enable us to be overcomers; and by the impartation of
          divine love, we shall ﬁnd access to the hearts of men. We shall have fastened our trembling grasp upon the
          throne of the Inﬁnite, and shall say, “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me” (Genesis 32:26).</p>
      <p>The assurance is given that He will bless us and make us a blessing; and this is our light, our joy, our
          triumph. When the youth understand what it is to have the favor and love of God in the heart, they will begin
          to realize the value of their <nobr>blood-bought</nobr> privileges, and will consecrate their ability to God,
          and strive with all their <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers to increase their talents to use in the Master’s
          service.</p>
      <p>The only safety for our youth in this age of sin and crime is to have a living connection with God. They must
          learn how to seek God, that they may be ﬁlled with His Holy Spirit, and act as though they realized that the
          whole host of heaven was looking upon them with interested solicitude, ready to minister unto them in danger
          and in time of need. The youth should be barricaded by warning and instruction against temptation. They should
          be taught what are the encouragements held out to them in the Word of God. They should have delineated before
          them the peril of taking a step into the bypaths of evil. They should be educated to revere the counsels of
          God in His sacred oracles. They should be so instructed that they will set their resolution against evil, and
          determine that they will not enter into any path where they could not expect Jesus to accompany them, and His
          blessing to abide upon <nobr>them.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 21, 1893.</p>
