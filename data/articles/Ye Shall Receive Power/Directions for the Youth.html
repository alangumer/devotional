    <h1>Directions for the Youth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Proverbs 3:6.</strong></p>
      <p>There are great things expected from the sons and daughters of God. I look upon the youth of today, and my
          heart yearns over them. What possibilities are open before them! If they sincerely seek to learn of Christ, He
          will give them wisdom, as He gave wisdom to Daniel. They may obtain directions from Him who is mighty in
          counsel. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (Psalm 111:10). Says the psalmist, “The entrance of
          thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple” (Psalm 119:130). And the wise man writes, “In
          all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”</p>
      <p>Let the youth try to appreciate the privilege that may be theirs, to be directed by the unerring wisdom of God.
          Let them take the Word of truth as the man of their counsel, and become skillful in the use of “the sword of
          the Spirit.” Satan is a wise general; but the humble, devoted soldier of Jesus Christ may overcome him. It is
          written of the victors, that “they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony”
          (Revelation 12:11).</p>
      <p>We must not trust in self. Our ﬁnite strength is only weakness. Says Jesus, “Without me ye can do nothing”; but
          He promises, “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done
          unto you” (John 15:5, 7).</p>
      <p>It is thought a great honor to be invited into the presence of a king of this earth. But let us consider the
          amazing privilege that is proffered to us. If we obey the requirements of God, we may become the sons and
          daughters of the King of the universe. Through a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour, we may be ﬁlled with the fruits
          of righteousness, and be ﬁtted to shine in the courts of the King of kings through unending ages.... Our
          work</p>
      <p>is to seek the closest union with the Son of God, to learn in His school, to become meek and lowly of heart, to
          work the works of Christ, advancing His kingdom and hastening His <nobr>coming.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          February 28, 1888.</p>
