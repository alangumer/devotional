    <h1>Humility</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful
          God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; we have
          sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy
          precepts and from thy judgments. Daniel 9:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>Spurious sanctiﬁcation carries with it a boastful, <nobr>self-righteous</nobr> spirit which is foreign to the
          religion of the Bible. Meekness and humility are the fruits of the Spirit. The prophet Daniel was an example
          of true sanctiﬁcation. His long life was ﬁlled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man “greatly
          beloved” (Daniel 10:11) of heaven, and was granted such honors as have rarely been vouchsafed to mortals. Yet
          his purity of character and unwavering ﬁdelity were equaled only by his humility and contrition.</p>
      <p>Instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identiﬁed himself with the really sinful of
          Israel, as he pleaded before God in behalf of his people: “We do not present our supplications before thee for
          our righteousness, but for thy great mercies” (Daniel 9:18). “We have sinned, we have done wickedly” (verse
          15). And “for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach”
          (verse 16).</p>
      <p>He declares, “I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people” (verse 20). And when
          at a later time the Son of God appeared in answer to his prayers to give him instruction, he declares, “My
          comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength” (Daniel 10:8).</p>
      <p>Those who are truly seeking to perfect Christian character will never indulge the thought that they are
          sinless. The more their minds dwell upon the character of Christ, and the nearer they approach to His divine
          image, the more clearly will they discern Its spotless perfection, and the more deeply will they feel their
          own weakness and defects. Those who claim to be without sin give evidence that they are far from holy. It is
          because they have no true knowledge of Christ that they can look upon themselves as reﬂecting His image. The
          greater the distance between them and their Saviour, the more righteous they appear in their own
          <nobr>eyes.—The</nobr> Spirit of Prophecy 4:301, 302.</p>
