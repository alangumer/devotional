    <h1>Feeling Our Spiritual Need</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon
          his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. Luke 18:13.</strong></p>
      <p>We should be often in prayer. The outpouring of the Spirit of God came in answer to earnest prayer. But mark
          this fact concerning the disciples. The record says, “They were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly
          there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it ﬁlled all the house where they were
          sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of ﬁre, and it sat upon each of them. And they
          were all ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost” (Acts <nobr>2:1-4).</nobr></p>
      <p>They were not assembled to relate tidbits of scandal. They were not seeking to expose every stain they could
          ﬁnd on a brother’s character. They felt their spiritual need, and cried to the Lord for the holy unction to
          help them in overcoming their own inﬁrmities, and to ﬁt them for the work of saving others. They prayed with
          intense earnestness that the love of Christ might be shed abroad in their hearts.</p>
      <p>This is our great need today in every church in our land. For “if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
          old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17). That which was
          objectionable in the character is puriﬁed from the soul by the love of Jesus. All selﬁshness is expelled, all
          envy, all <nobr>evil-speaking,</nobr> is rooted out, and a radical transformation is wrought in the heart.
          “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance: against such there is no law” (Galatians 5:22, 23). “The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace
          of them that make peace” (James 3:18).</p>
      <p>Paul says that “as touching the <nobr>law”—as</nobr> far as outward acts were <nobr>concerned—he</nobr> was
          “blameless,” but when the spiritual character of the law was discerned, when he looked into the holy mirror,
          he saw himself a sinner. Judged by a human standard, he had abstained from sin, but when he looked into the
          depths of God’s law, and saw himself as God saw him, he bowed in humiliation, and confessed his
          <nobr>guilt.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 22, 1890.</p>
