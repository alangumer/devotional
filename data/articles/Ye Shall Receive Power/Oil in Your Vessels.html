    <h1>Oil in Your Vessels</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took oil in their
          vessels with their lamps. Matthew 25:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>Many receive the truth readily, but they fail to assimilate truth, and its inﬂuence is not abiding. They are
          like the foolish virgins, who had no oil in their vessels with their lamps. Oil is a symbol of the Holy
          Spirit, which is brought into the soul through faith in Jesus Christ. Those who earnestly search the
          Scriptures with much prayer, who rely upon God with ﬁrm faith, who obey His commandments, will be among those
          who are represented as wise virgins. The teachings of the Word of God are not yea and nay, but yea and
          amen.</p>
      <p>The requirement of the gospel is <nobr>far-reaching.</nobr> Says the apostle, “Whatsoever ye do in word or
          deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him” (Colossians 3:17).
          “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
          Practical piety will not be attained by giving the grand truths of the Bible a place in the outer courts of
          the heart. The religion of the Bible must be brought into the large and the little affairs of life. It must
          furnish the powerful motives and principles that will regulate the Christian’s character and course of
          action....</p>
      <p>The oil so much needed by those who are represented as foolish virgins, is not something to be put on the
          outside. They need to bring the truth into the sanctuary of the soul, that it may cleanse, reﬁne, and
          sanctify. It is not theory that they need; it is the sacred teachings of the Bible, which are not uncertain,
          disconnected doctrines, but are living truths, that involve eternal interests that center in Christ. In Him is
          the complete system of divine truth. The salvation of the soul, through faith in Christ, is the ground and
          pillar of the truth.</p>
      <p>Those who exercise true faith in Christ make it manifest by holiness of character, by obedience to the law of
          God. They realize that the truth as it is in Jesus reaches heaven, and compasses eternity. They understand
          that the Christian’s character should represent the character of Christ, and be full of grace and truth. To
          them is imparted the oil of grace, which sustains a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> light. The Holy Spirit in the
          heart of the believer makes him complete in <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, September 17,
          1895.</p>
