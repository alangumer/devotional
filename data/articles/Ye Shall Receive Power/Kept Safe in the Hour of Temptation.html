    <h1>Kept Safe in the Hour of Temptation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
          which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Revelation 3:10.</strong></p>
      <p>A battle is continually going on between the forces for good and the forces for evil, between the angels of God
          and the fallen angels. We are beset before and behind, on the right hand and on the left. The conﬂict that we
          are passing through is the last we shall have in this world. We are now in the midst of it. Two parties are
          striving for the supremacy. In this conﬂict we cannot be neutral. We must stand either on one side or on the
          other. If we take our position on the side of Christ, if we acknowledge Him before the world in word and work,
          we are bearing a living testimony as to whom we have chosen to serve and honor. In this important period of
          earth’s history, we cannot afford to leave anyone in uncertainty as to whose side we are on....</p>
      <p>“Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall
          come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.” In this scripture is brought to view the hour
          of temptation that is to try them that dwell upon the earth. We are now living in this trying hour. There is
          no escape for any from this conﬂict. If in your life there are defective traits of character that you are not
          striving to overcome, you may be assured that the enemy will endeavor to take advantage of them; for he is
          watching vigilantly, seeking to spoil the faith of everyone.</p>
      <p>In order to gain the victory over every besetment of the enemy, we must lay hold on a power that is out of and
          beyond ourselves. We must maintain a constant, living connection with Christ, who has power to give victory to
          every soul that will maintain an attitude of faith and humility. If we are <nobr>self-sufﬁcient,</nobr> and
          think that we may go on just as we please, and yet hope to come out on the right side ﬁnally, we shall ﬁnd
          that we have made a terrible mistake. As those who hope to receive the overcomer’s reward, we must press
          forward in the Christian warfare, though at every advance we meet with <nobr>opposition.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, July 9, 1908.</p>
