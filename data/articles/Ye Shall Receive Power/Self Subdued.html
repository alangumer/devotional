    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the ﬁre, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that
          thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
          eyesalve, that thou mayest see. Revelation 3:18.</strong></p>
      <p>There is to be in the churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of God, but it will not move upon those
          who have not humbled themselves before the Lord, and opened the door of the heart by confession and
          repentance. In the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of God, they will see
          only something which in their blindness they think dangerous, something which will arouse their fears, and
          they will brace themselves to resist it. Because the Lord does not work according to their ideas and
          expectations, they will oppose the work. “Why,” they say, “should not we know the Spirit of God, when we have
          been in the work so many years?” Because they did not respond to the warnings, the entreaties of the messages
          of God, but persistently said, “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing” (Revelation
          3:17).</p>
      <p>Talent, long experience, will not make men channels of light, unless they place themselves under the bright
          beams of the Sun of righteousness, and are called, and chosen, and prepared by the endowment of the Holy
          Spirit. When men who handle sacred things will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, the Lord will
          lift them up. He will make them men of <nobr>understanding—men</nobr> rich in the grace of His Spirit. Their
          strong, selﬁsh traits of character, their stubbornness, will be seen in the light shining from the Light of
          the world. “I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
          repent” (Revelation 2:5). If you seek the Lord with all your heart, He will be found of you.</p>
      <p>The end is near! We have not a moment to lose! Light is to shine forth from God’s people in clear, distinct
          rays, bringing Jesus before the churches and before the <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December
          23, 1890.</p>
