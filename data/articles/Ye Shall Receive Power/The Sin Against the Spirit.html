    <h1>The Sin Against the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy
          against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. Matthew 12:31.</strong></p>
      <p>I will address these lines to those who have had light, those who have had privileges, those who have had
          warnings and entreaties, who have made no determined effort to yield themselves in full surrender to God. I
          would warn you to fear lest you sin against the Holy Ghost, and be left to your own course, sunk in moral
          lethargy, and never obtain forgiveness. Why allow yourselves to be longer educated in the school of Satan, and
          pursue a course of action that will make repentance and reformation impossible? Why resist the overtures of
          mercy? Why say, “Let me alone,” until God shall be compelled to give you your desire, since you will have it
          so?</p>
      <p>Those who resist the Spirit of God think that they will repent at some future day, when they get ready to take
          a decided step toward reformation; but repentance will then be beyond their power. According to the light and
          privileges given will be the darkness of those who refuse to walk in the light while they have the light.</p>
      <p>No one need look upon the sin against the Holy Ghost as something mysterious and indeﬁnable. The sin against
          the Holy Ghost is the sin of persistent refusal to respond to the invitation to repent. If you refuse to
          believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour, you love darkness rather than light, you love the atmosphere
          that surrounded the ﬁrst great apostate. You choose this atmosphere rather than the atmosphere that surrounds
          the Father and the Son, and God allows you to have your choice. But let no soul be discouraged by this
          presentation of the matter. Let no one who is striving to do the will of the Master be cast down. Hope thou in
          God. The Lord Jesus has made it manifest that He regards you at an inﬁnite estimation. He left His royal
          throne, He left His royal courts, He clothed His divinity with humanity, and died a shameful death upon the
          cross of Calvary, that you might be <nobr>saved.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 29, 1897.</p>
