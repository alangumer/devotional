    <h1>Happiness in Serving Our Captain</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Fight the good ﬁght of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast
          professed a good profession before many witnesses. 1 Timothy 6:12.</strong></p>
      <p>In earnest, determined exercise as faithful soldiers, obeying the orders of the Captain of our salvation, there
          is genuine enjoyment such as can be obtained in no other employment. The peace of Christ will be in the heart
          of the faithful soldier. There is rest for the soul in wearing Christ’s yoke, in lifting Christ’s burdens. It
          seems a contradiction to say that there is no rest for the soul except that which is found in continuous and
          devoted service. But this is true. Happiness comes in willing, obedient service, where all the powers of our
          being are moving in happy, healthy, harmonious action in obeying our Captain’s orders. The more responsible
          the task assigned to Christ’s soldiers, the more the soul exults in the Saviour’s love and approval. The soul
          realizes a freedom in the performance of the weightiest and most taxing duties.</p>
      <p>But this doing the duty of a soldier means work. It is not always just such work as we would choose. Outward
          inconveniences, difﬁculties, and trials have to be borne by the soldiers of Jesus. There is a constant warfare
          to be maintained against the evils and inclinations of our own natural hearts. We must not pick and choose the
          work most agreeable to us; for we are Christ’s soldiers, under His discipline, and we are not to study our own
          pleasure. We must ﬁght the battles of the Lord manfully. We have enemies to conquer that would gain the
          control of all our powers.</p>
      <p><nobr>Self-will</nobr> in us must die; Christ’s will alone must be obeyed. The soldier in Christ’s army must
          learn to endure hardness, deny self, take up the cross, and follow where his Captain leads the way. There are
          many things to do which are trying to human nature, and painful to ﬂesh and blood. This work of
          <nobr>self-subduing</nobr> requires determined, continuous effort. In ﬁghting the good ﬁght of faith,
          obtaining precious victories, we are laying hold of eternal <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Youth’s Instructor,
          December 22, 1886.</p>
