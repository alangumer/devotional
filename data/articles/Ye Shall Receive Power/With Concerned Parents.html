    <h1>With Concerned Parents</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of
          thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall
          be converted unto thee. Psalm <nobr>51:11-13.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>What a prayer is this! How evident it is that sinners in the household are not to be treated with indifference,
          but that the Lord looks upon them as the purchase of His blood. In every household where the unconverted are,
          it should be the work of those who know the Lord to work in wisdom for their conversion. The Lord will surely
          bless the efforts of parents, as in His fear and love they seek to save the souls of their households. The
          Lord Jesus is waiting to be gracious.</p>
      <p>Oh, that the work might begin at the heart! “For thou desirest not sacriﬁce; else would I give it: thou
          delightest not in burnt offering. The sacriﬁces of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O
          God, thou wilt not despise” (Psalm 51:16, 17). Then let it be understood by all the members of the household
          that the work must begin at the heart. The heart must be subdued and made contrite through the creating,
          regenerating power of the Holy Spirit. Realizing the aid of this mighty agency, cannot parents work for the
          conversion of their children with more zeal and love than ever before?</p>
      <p>The promise of the Lord is “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your
          ﬁlthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
          will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your ﬂesh, and I will give you a heart of
          ﬂesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my
          judgments, and do them” (Ezekiel <nobr>36:25-27).</nobr></p>
      <p>When the Spirit of the Lord works upon the hearts of the parents, their prayers and tears will come up before
          God, and they will earnestly entreat, and will receive grace and wisdom from heaven, and will be able to work
          for their unconverted children. As this Spirit is manifested in the home, it will be brought into the church,
          and those who are home missionaries will also become agents for God in the church and in the world. The
          institutions which God has planted will bear an entirely different <nobr>mold.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          March 14, 1893.</p>
