    <h1>Paul</h1>

      <p><strong>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a
          minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will
          appear unto thee. Acts 26:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The solemn charge that had been given Paul on the occasion of his interview with Ananias rested with increasing
          weight upon his heart. When, in response to the invitation “Brother Saul, receive thy sight,” Paul had for the
          ﬁrst time looked upon the face of this devout man, Ananias under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit said to
          him: “The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and
          shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and
          heard. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the
          Lord” (Acts <nobr>22:13-16).</nobr></p>
      <p>These words were in harmony with the words of Jesus Himself, who, when He arrested Saul on the journey to
          Damascus, declared: “I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of
          these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee
          from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from
          darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
          inheritance among them which are sanctiﬁed by faith that is in me” (Acts <nobr>26:16-18).</nobr></p>
      <p>As he pondered these things in his heart, Paul understood more and more the meaning of his call to be “an
          apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God” (Ephesians 1:1). His call had come “not of men, neither by man,
          but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father” (Galatians 1:1). The greatness of the work before him led him to give
          much study to the Holy Scriptures, in order that he might preach the gospel “not with wisdom of words, lest
          the cross of Christ should be made of none effect” (1 Corinthians 1:17), “but in demonstration of the Spirit
          and of power,” that the faith of all who heard “should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of
          God” (1 Corinthians 2:4, <nobr>5).—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 30, 1911.</p>
