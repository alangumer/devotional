    <h1>Weak Souls Strengthened</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the ﬂesh, to live after the ﬂesh. For if ye live after the
          ﬂesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. Romans 8:12,
          13.</strong></p>
      <p>The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race. Christ declared that the divine
          inﬂuence of His Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost to the present
          time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To
          all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctiﬁer, guide,
          and witness. The more closely believers have walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they
          testiﬁed of their Redeemer’s love and of His saving grace. The men and women who through the long centuries of
          persecution and trial enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives have stood as signs
          and wonders in the world. Before angels and men they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming
          love.</p>
      <p>Those who at Pentecost were endued with power from on high, were not thereby freed from further temptation and
          trial. As they witnessed for truth and righteousness they were repeatedly assailed by the enemy of all truth,
          who sought to rob them of their Christian experience. They were compelled to strive with all their
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Daily they
          prayed for fresh supplies of grace, that they might reach higher and still higher toward perfection. Under the
          Holy Spirit’s working even the weakest, by exercising faith in God, learned to improve their entrusted powers
          and to become sanctiﬁed, reﬁned, and ennobled. As in humility they submitted to the molding inﬂuence of the
          Holy Spirit, they received of the fullness of the Godhead and were fashioned in the likeness of the
          <nobr>divine.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 49, 50.</p>
