    <h1>Ambassadors for Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s
          stead, be ye reconciled to God. 2 Corinthians 5:20.</strong></p>
      <p>We are ambassadors for Christ, and we are to live, not to save our reputation, but to save perishing souls from
          perdition. Our daily endeavor should be to show them that they may gain truth and righteousness. Instead of
          trying to elicit sympathy for ourselves, by giving others the impression that we are not appreciated, we are
          to forget self entirely; and if we fail to do this, through want of spiritual discernment and vital piety, God
          will require at our hands the souls of those for whom we should have labored. He has made provision that every
          worker in His service may have grace and wisdom, that he may become a living epistle, known and read of all
          men.</p>
      <p>By watchfulness and prayer we may accomplish just what the Lord designs that we shall. By faithful, painstaking
          discharge of our duty, by watching for souls as they that must give account, we may remove every stumbling
          block out of the way of others. By earnest warnings and entreaties, with our own souls drawn out in tender
          solicitude for those that are ready to perish, we may win souls to Christ.</p>
      <p>I would that all my brethren and sisters would remember that it is a serious thing to grieve the Holy Spirit,
          and it is grieved when the human agent seeks to work himself, and refuses to enter the service of the Lord
          because the cross is too heavy or the <nobr>self-denial</nobr> too great. The Holy Spirit seeks to abide in
          each soul. If it is welcomed as an honored guest, those who receive it will be made complete in Christ. The
          good work begun will be ﬁnished; the holy thoughts, heavenly affections, and Christlike actions will take the
          place of impure thoughts, perverse sentiments, and rebellious acts.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is a divine teacher. If we heed its lessons, we shall become wise unto salvation. But we need
          to guard well our hearts, for too often we forget the heavenly instruction we have received, and seek to act
          out the natural inclinations of our unconsecrated minds. Each one must ﬁght his own battle against self. Heed
          the teachings of the Holy Spirit. If this is done, they will be repeated again and again until the impressions
          are as it were “lead in the rock <nobr>forever.”—Counsels</nobr> on Health, 560, 561.</p>
