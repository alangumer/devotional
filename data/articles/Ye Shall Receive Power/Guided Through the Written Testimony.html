    <h1>Guided Through the Written Testimony</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
          light in them. Isaiah 8:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit always leads to the written Word, and calls the attention to the great moral standard of
          righteousness. To be honored of God in thus being privileged to testify of the truth is a wonderful thing.
          Said Christ to His disciples just before He ascended up and the clouds of angels received Him out of their
          sight, “Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the
          uttermost part of the earth” (Acts 1:8). They were qualiﬁed by the heavenly endowment of the Holy Spirit to
          testify of Christ.</p>
      <p>I wish to impress upon you the fact that those who have Jesus abiding in the heart by faith have actually
          received the Holy Spirit. Every individual who receives Jesus as his personal Saviour just as surely receives
          the Holy Spirit to be his Counselor, Sanctiﬁer, Guide, and Witness. The more closely the believer walks with
          God, the clearer his witness, and, as a sure result, the more powerful will be the inﬂuence of his testimony
          upon others of a Saviour’s love; the more he will give evidence that he prizes the Word of God. It is his
          meat, it is his drink, to satisfy the thirsty soul. He prizes the privilege of learning the will of God from
          His Word.</p>
      <p>Some souls who claim to be believers have slighted, and turned from, the Word of God. They have neglected the
          Bible, the wonderful Guidebook, the true tester of all ideas, and claim that they have the Spirit to teach
          them, that this renders searching the Scriptures unnecessary. All such are heeding the sophistry of Satan, for
          the Spirit and the Word agree. Say the Scriptures, “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
          according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” He only is a free man whom the truth makes
          <nobr>free.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 14:70, 71.</p>
