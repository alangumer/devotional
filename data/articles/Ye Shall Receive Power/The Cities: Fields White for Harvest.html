    <h1>The Cities: Fields White for Harvest</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your
          eyes, and look on the ﬁelds; for they are white already to harvest. John 4:35.</strong></p>
      <p>To us, as surely as to the disciples of that time, Christ speaks these words. Time is passing, and the Lord
          calls upon the workers in all lines of His work to lift up their eyes and behold the ﬁelds all ripe for the
          harvest.</p>
      <p>Our workers are not branching out as they should in their efforts. Our leading men are not awake to the work
          that must yet be accomplished. When I think of the cities in which so little work has been done, in which
          there are so many thousands to be warned of the soon coming of the Saviour, I feel an intensity of desire to
          see men and women going forth to the work in the power of the Spirit, ﬁlled with Christ’s love for perishing
          souls.</p>
      <p>The heathen in the cities at our doors have been strangely neglected. Organized effort should be made to save
          them. We are now to work to convert the heathen who are in the midst of <nobr>us—those</nobr> who are living
          within the shadow of our doors. A new song is to be put in their mouths, and they are to go forth to impart to
          others now in darkness the light of the third angel’s message.</p>
      <p>We all need to be wide awake that, as the way opens, we may advance the work in the large cities. We are far
          behind in following the light given us to enter the cities and erect memorials for God. Step by step we are to
          lead souls into the full light of truth. Many are longing for spiritual food. We are to continue working until
          a church is organized and a humble house of worship built. I am greatly encouraged to believe that many
          persons not of our faith will help considerably by their means. The light given me is that in many places,
          especially in the great cities of America, help will be given by such <nobr>persons.—Paciﬁc</nobr> Union
          Recorder, October 23, 1902.</p>
