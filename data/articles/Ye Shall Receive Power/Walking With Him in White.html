    <h1>Walking With Him in White</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not deﬁled their garments; and they shall walk with me
          in white: for they are worthy. Revelation 3:4.</strong></p>
      <p>Thank God, He can keep His people in a place where they shall not deﬁle their garments. If we submit to Christ,
          we shall be kept unspotted from the world. “Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going
          forth is prepared as the morning” (Hosea 6:3). We are to follow on. We are not to rest content with the
          capabilities and the knowledge of today. All the inhabitants of the universe are watching, as in these last
          days God is preparing a people to stand in the judgment. Let us ask God to clothe us with the robe of Christ’s
          righteousness, that we may be prepared for the coming of the Son of man.</p>
      <p>Of those who have not deﬁled their garments, Christ says, “They shall walk with me in white: for they are
          worthy.” Through inﬁnite sacriﬁce made in our behalf, we may have an abundance of grace. God has a whole
          heaven full for us. All He asks is that by living faith we receive His promises, saying: “I do believe. I do
          accept the blessings which Thou hast for those who love Thee.”</p>
      <p>“He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will <nobr>not”—oh,</nobr> how precious
          is that <nobr>“not”!—“I</nobr> will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name
          before my Father, and before his angels” (Revelation 3:5). When the gates of the city of God swing back on
          their glittering hinges, and the nations who have kept the truth shall enter in, Christ will be there to
          welcome us, to call us the blessed of the Father, because we have overcome. He will welcome us before the
          Father, and before His angels. As we enter the kingdom of God, there to spend eternity, the trials and the
          difﬁculties and the perplexities that we have had here will sink into insigniﬁcance. Our life will measure
          with the life of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> General Conference Bulletin, April 6, 1903.</p>
