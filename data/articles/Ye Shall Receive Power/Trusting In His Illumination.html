    <h1>Trusting In His Illumination</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. Psalm
          119:34.</strong></p>
      <p>All over the ﬁeld of revelation are scattered glad springs of heavenly truth, peace, and joy. These fountains
          of joy are within the reach of every seeker. The words of Inspiration, pondered in the heart, will be as
          living streams ﬂowing from the river of the water of life. Our Saviour prayed that the mind of His followers
          might be opened to understand the Scriptures. Whenever we study the Bible with a prayerful heart, the Holy
          Spirit is near to open to us the meaning of the words we read. The man whose mind is enlightened by the
          opening of God’s Word to his understanding will not only feel that he must more diligently seek to understand
          that Word, but that he must have a better understanding of the sciences. He will feel that he is called to a
          high calling in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>The more closely connected man is with the Source of all knowledge and wisdom, the more he will feel that he
          must advance in intellectual and spiritual attainments. The opening of God’s Word is always followed by a
          remarkable opening and strengthening of man’s faculties; for the entrance of His words giveth light. By
          contemplation of great truths, the mind is elevated, the affections puriﬁed and reﬁned; for the Spirit of God,
          through the truth of God, quickens the lifeless spiritual faculties, and attracts the soul heavenward.</p>
      <p>Then take your Bible and present yourself before your heavenly Father, saying, “Enlighten me; teach me what is
          truth.” The Lord will regard your prayer, and the Holy Spirit will impress the truth upon your soul. In
          searching the Scriptures for yourself, you will become established in the faith. It is of the greatest
          importance that you continually search the Scriptures, storing the mind with the truths of God. You may be
          separated from the companionship of Christians, and placed where you will not have the privilege of meeting
          with the children of God. You need the treasures of God’s Word hidden in your heart, that when opposition
          comes upon you, you may bring everything to the test of the <nobr>Scriptures.—The</nobr> Bible Echo, October
          15, 1892.</p>
