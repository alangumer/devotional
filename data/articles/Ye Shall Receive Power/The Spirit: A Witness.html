    <h1>The Spirit: A Witness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. Romans
          8:16.</strong></p>
      <p>If the Spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, what is the result? The
          believing soul comes into perfect submission to the will of God. The Majesty of heaven condescends to a holy,
          familiar intercourse with him who seeks God with the whole heart, and the child of God, through the abundant
          manifestation of His grace, is softened into a childlike dependence. You must commit your soul and body unto
          God with perfect trust in His power and willingness to bless you, helpless and unworthy as you are. “As many
          as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name” (John
          1:12).</p>
      <p>Do not become restlessly active, but zealous in faith, with one object, namely, to attract souls to Jesus
          Christ, the cruciﬁed Redeemer. It is not the logical sermon, the sermon to convince the intellect, that will
          do this work. The heart must be persuaded, and melted into tenderness. The will must be submitted to God’s
          will, and the whole aspirations directed heavenward. You must feed upon the word of the living God. It must be
          brought into the practical life. It must take hold of and command the whole man....</p>
      <p>When Jesus is our abiding trust, our offering to God will be ourselves. Our dependence will be on the
          righteousness and intercession of Christ Jesus as our only hope. There is no confusion, no distrust, because
          by faith we see Jesus ordained of God for this very purpose, to make reconciliation for the sins of the world.
          He stands engaged by solemn covenant to mediate in behalf of all who come to God by Him, and to accomplish
          their salvation if they will only believe. The privilege is granted us to come boldly to the throne of grace,
          that we may obtain mercy, and ﬁnd grace to help in every time of <nobr>need.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases
          14:276, 277.</p>
