    <h1>Asking for His Blessing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with
          them? Luke 18:7.</strong></p>
      <p>We may have long followed the narrow path, but it is not safe to take this as proof that we shall follow it to
          the end. If we have walked with God in fellowship of the Spirit, it is because we have sought Him daily by
          faith. From the two olive trees, the golden oil ﬂowing through the golden pipes has been communicated to us.
          But those who do not cultivate the spirit and habit of prayer cannot expect to receive the golden oil of
          goodness, patience, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, love.</p>
      <p>Everyone is to keep himself separate from the world, which is full of iniquity. We are not to walk with God for
          a time, and then part from His company, and walk in the sparks of our own kindling. There must be a ﬁrm
          continuance, a perseverance in acts of faith. We are to praise God, to show forth His glory in a righteous
          character. No one of us will gain the victory without persevering, untiring effort, proportionate to the value
          of the object which we seek, even eternal life.</p>
      <p>The dispensation in which we are now living is to be, to those that ask, the dispensation of the Holy Spirit.
          Ask for His blessing. It is time we were more intense in our devotion. To us is committed the arduous, but
          happy, glorious work of revealing Christ to those who are in darkness. We are called to proclaim the special
          truths for this time. For all this the outpouring of the Spirit is essential. We should pray for [the Spirit].
          The Lord expects us to ask Him. We have not been wholehearted in this work.</p>
      <p>What can I say to my brethren in the name of the Lord? What proportion of our efforts has been made in
          accordance with the light the Lord has been pleased to give? We cannot depend upon form or external machinery.
          What we need is the quickening inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit of God. “Not by might, nor by power, but by my
          Spirit, said the Lord of hosts” (Zechariah 4:6). Pray without ceasing, and watch by working in accordance with
          your prayers. As you pray, believe, trust in God. It is the time of the latter rain, when the Lord will give
          largely of His Spirit. Be fervent in prayer, and watch in the <nobr>Spirit.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          March 2, 1897.</p>
