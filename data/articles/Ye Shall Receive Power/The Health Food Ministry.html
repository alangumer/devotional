      <p><strong>And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now
          past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. But Jesus said
          unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. Matthew 14:15, 16.</strong></p>
      <p>I have earnest words to speak to those who shall engage in the health food business. There is to be an entirely
          different feature brought into the work of our food stores, restaurants, and into every line in which our food
          productions are handled. This work must be carried forward as a means of gospel enlightenment to those who
          have not given themselves to the Lord. Those who handle these foods need daily the counsel of the One who
          created food for the ﬁve thousand hungry men. The work of our food stores and restaurants must be carried on
          in such a way that there will be no loss ﬁnancially. We must not forget that this line of work needs to live.
          But all corrupting inﬂuences must be weeded out from it.</p>
      <p>Keep on the gaining side we must. But what is the use of carrying on this work if we have to sacriﬁce
          principles of justice, mercy, and the love of God? What is the use of carrying it on if through its inﬂuence,
          no souls are enlightened and prepared to lay hold upon the Word that is their spiritual food? Upon those
          connected with this work there should be urged the necessity of calling the attention of the people with whom
          they are brought into contact to the truths of heavenly origin.</p>
      <p>There should be appointed to the health food work men who are well qualiﬁed to speak words in season, and out
          of season, and who can enlighten the minds of men and women in regard to the truth. Special wisdom is needed
          in order to understand when to speak, and when to keep silent. Let each worker pray much for spiritual
          <nobr>understanding.—The</nobr> Health Food Ministry, 89.</p>
