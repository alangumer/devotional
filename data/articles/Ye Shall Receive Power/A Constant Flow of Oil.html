    <h1>A Constant Flow of Oil</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden
          pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And
          I said, No, my lord. Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
          Zechariah <nobr>4:12-14.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The continual communication of the Holy Spirit to the church is represented by the prophet Zechariah under
          another ﬁgure, which contains a wonderful lesson of encouragement for us. The prophet says: “The angel that
          talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, and said unto me, What
          seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it,
          and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: and two olive
          trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.</p>
      <p>“So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my Lord? ... Then he
          answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
          power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.... And I answered again, and said unto him, What be
          these</p>
      <p>two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? ... Then said he,
          These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth” (Zechariah
          <nobr>4:1-14).</nobr></p>
      <p>From the two olive trees, the golden oil was emptied through golden pipes into the bowl of the candlestick, and
          thence into the golden lamps that gave light to the sanctuary. So from the holy ones that stand in God’s
          presence, His Spirit is imparted to human instrumentalities that are consecrated to His service. The mission
          of the two anointed ones is to communicate light and power to God’s people. It is to receive blessing for us
          that they stand in God’s presence. As the olive trees empty themselves into the golden pipes, so the heavenly
          messengers seek to communicate all that they receive from God. The whole heavenly treasure awaits our demand
          and reception; and as we receive the blessing, we in our turn are to impart it. Thus it is that the holy lamps
          are fed, and the church becomes a <nobr>light-bearer</nobr> in the <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          March 2, 1897.</p>
