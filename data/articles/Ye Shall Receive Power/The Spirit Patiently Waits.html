    <h1>The Spirit Patiently Waits</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
          him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Revelation 3:20.</strong></p>
      <p>All, from the oldest to the youngest, need to be taught of God. We may be taught by man to see the truth
          clearly, but God alone can teach the heart to receive the truth savingly, which means to receive the words of
          eternal life into good and honest hearts. The Lord is waiting patiently to instruct every willing soul who
          will be taught. The fault is not with the willing Instructor, the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, but it
          is with the learner who holds to his own impressions and ideas, and will not give up his human theories and
          come in humility to be taught. He will not allow his conscience and his heart to be educated, disciplined, and
          <nobr>trained—worked</nobr> as the husbandman works the earth, and as the architect constructs the building.
          “Ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building” (1 Corinthians 3:9).</p>
      <p>Everyone needs to be worked, molded, and fashioned after the divine similitude. Christ tells you, my dear
          friends, young and old, the everlasting truth, “Except ye eat the ﬂesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
          ye have no life in you. [If you do not take Christ’s word as the man of your counsel, you will not reveal His
          wisdom or His spiritual life.] Whoso eateth my ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; ... For my ﬂesh
          is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my ﬂesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
          and I in him” (John <nobr>6:53-56).</nobr> Said Christ, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the ﬂesh proﬁteth
          nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life” (verse 63).</p>
      <p>Those who search the Scriptures, and most earnestly seek to understand them, will reveal the sanctiﬁcation of
          the Spirit through the belief of the truth, for they take into their very heart the truth, and have that faith
          that works by love and puriﬁes the soul. All their spiritual sinew and muscle are nourished by the Bread of
          Life which they <nobr>eat.—Manuscript</nobr> Releases 8:162, 163.</p>
