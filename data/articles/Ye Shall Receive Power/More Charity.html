      <p><strong>Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou
          take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the ﬁnger, and speaking vanity: and if thou
          draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afﬂicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and
          thy darkness be as the noonday. Isaiah 58:9, 10.</strong></p>
      <p>Let all who claim to keep the commandments of God, look well to this matter, and see if there are not reasons
          why they do not have more of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. How many have lifted up their souls unto
          vanity! They think themselves exalted in the favor of God, but they neglect the needy, they turn a deaf ear to
          the calls of the oppressed, and speak sharp, cutting words to those who need altogether different treatment.
          Thus they offend God daily by their hardness of heart. These afﬂicted ones have claims upon the sympathies and
          the interest of their fellow men. They have a right to expect help, comfort, and Christlike love. But this is
          not what they receive.</p>
      <p>Every neglect of God’s suffering ones is written in the books of heaven as if shown to Christ Himself. Let
          every member of the church closely examine his heart, and investigate his course of action, to see if these
          are in harmony with the Spirit and work of Jesus; for if not, what can he say when he stands before the Judge
          of all the earth? Can the Lord say to him, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
          you from the foundation of the world”? (Matthew 25:34)?</p>
      <p>Christ has identiﬁed His interest with that of suffering humanity; and while He is neglected in the person of
          His afﬂicted ones, all our assemblies, all our appointed meetings, all the machinery that is set in operation
          to advance the cause of God, will be of little avail. “These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
          undone” (Luke 11:42). “Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting” (Daniel 5:27).</p>
      <p>All who are to be saints in heaven will ﬁrst be saints upon the earth. They will not follow the sparks of their
          own kindling, they will not work for praise, nor speak words of vanity, nor put forth the ﬁnger in
          condemnation and oppression; but they will follow the Light of life, diffuse light, comfort, hope, and courage
          to the very ones who need help, and not censure and <nobr>reproach.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August 4,
          1891.</p>
