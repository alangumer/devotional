    <h1>Unlimited Supplies of Missionary Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women. Insomuch that they
          brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of
          Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. Acts 5:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>The last words of Christ [to His disciples] were, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
          creature” (Mark 16:15). And spreading His hands above them in benediction, He ascended to heaven, surrounded
          by hosts of heavenly angels who had come to escort Him on His way to the portals of God. His last commission
          to His disciples made them the agents whereby His gospel of glad tidings was to go to the nations. This was
          Christ’s last will and testament to His followers who walked with Him during the years of His earthly
          ministry, and to those who should believe on Him through their word. His ﬁrst work in heaven was in harmony
          with His last commission on earth; for He sent the promise of the Father upon them. On the day of Pentecost
          the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the praying disciples, and they testiﬁed as to its source to all, wherever
          they went.</p>
      <p>The missionary spirit was poured out in unlimited supplies, and the disciples testiﬁed of a cruciﬁed and risen
          Saviour, and convinced the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment to come. They did just as their
          risen Lord had directed them to do, and began at Jerusalem to publish the gospel, in the very place where the
          deepest prejudice existed, and where the most confused ideas prevailed in regard to Him who had been cruciﬁed
          as a malefactor. Three thousand received the message, and were converted. They were not intimidated through
          persecution, imprisonment, and death; but they continued to speak with all boldness the words of truth,
          setting before the Jews the work and mission and ministry of Christ, His cruciﬁxion, resurrection, and
          ascension; and believers were added daily to the Lord, both of men and <nobr>women.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, November 6, 1894.</p>
