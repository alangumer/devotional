    <h1>Eyes Looking Heavenward</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.
          Philippians 3:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Shall we not break off our sins by righteousness, and have our conversation in heaven, whence we look for our
          Saviour? Shall we not talk of our Saviour until it becomes natural for us to do so? If we do not order our
          conversation aright, we shall not see the salvation of God. Satan will take possession of the heart, and we
          shall become low and sensual. Let us elevate the thoughts, and take hold upon things that are of real value,
          gaining an education here that will be of value in the world to come. Shall we not seek the Lord with
          earnestness, repent of our backslidings, mourn that we have neglected His Word, that we do not know the truth
          better, and turn to Him will all the heart, that He may heal us, and love us freely? Today let us take a step
          toward heaven....</p>
      <p>The latter rain is to fall upon the people of God. A mighty angel is to come down from heaven, and the whole
          earth is to be lighted with His glory. Are we ready to take part in the glorious work of the third angel? Are
          our vessels ready to receive the heavenly dew? Have we deﬁlement and sin in the heart? If so, let us cleanse
          the soul temple, and prepare for the showers of the latter rain. The refreshing from the presence of the Lord
          will never come to hearts ﬁlled with impurity. May God help us to die to self, that Christ, the hope of glory,
          may be formed within!</p>
      <p>I must have the Spirit of God in my heart. I can never go forward to do the great work of God, unless the Holy
          Spirit rests upon my soul. “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God”
          (Psalm 42:1). The day of judgment is upon us. Oh, that we may wash our robes of character, and make them white
          in the blood of the <nobr>Lamb!—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 21, 1891.</p>
