      <p><strong>And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. Psalm 50:15.
          When trials arise that seem unexplainable, we should not allow our peace to be spoiled. However unjustly we
          may be treated, let not passion arise. By indulging a spirit of retaliation we injure ourselves. We destroy
          our own conﬁdence in God, and grieve the Holy Spirit. There is by our side a Witness, a heavenly Messenger,
          who will lift up for us a standard against the enemy. He will shut us in with the bright beams of the Sun
          of</strong></p>
      <p>Righteousness. Beyond this Satan cannot penetrate. He cannot pass this shield of holy light.</p>
      <p>While the world is progressing in wickedness, none of us need ﬂatter ourselves that we shall have no
          difﬁculties. But it is these very difﬁculties that bring us into the audience chamber of the Most High. We may
          seek counsel of One who is inﬁnite in wisdom.</p>
      <p>The Lord says, “Call upon me in the day of trouble” (Psalm 50:15). He invites us to present to Him our
          perplexities and necessities, and our need of divine help. He bids us be instant in prayer. As soon as
          difﬁculties arise, we are to offer to Him our sincere, earnest petitions. By our importunate prayers we give
          evidence of our strong conﬁdence in God. The sense of our need leads us to pray earnestly, and our heavenly
          Father is moved by our supplications.</p>
      <p>Often those who suffer reproach or persecution for their faith are tempted to think themselves forsaken by God.
          In the eyes of men they are in the minority. To all appearance their enemies triumph over them. But let them
          not violate their conscience. He who has suffered in their behalf, and has borne their sorrows and afﬂictions,
          has not forsaken them.</p>
      <p>The children of God are not left alone and defenseless. Prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence. Prayer has
          “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the
          violence of <nobr>ﬁre”—we</nobr> shall know what it means when we hear the reports of the martyrs who died for
          their <nobr>faith—“turned</nobr> to ﬂight the armies of the aliens” (Hebrews 11:33, <nobr>34).—Christ’s</nobr>
          Object Lessons, 171, 172.</p>
