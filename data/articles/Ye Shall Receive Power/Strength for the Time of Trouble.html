    <h1>Strength for the Time of Trouble</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy
          people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same
          time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
          Daniel 12:1.</strong></p>
      <p>As the members of the body of Christ approach the period of their last conﬂict, “the time of Jacob’s trouble,”
          they will grow up into Christ, and will partake largely of His spirit. As the third message swells to a loud
          cry, and as great power and glory attend the closing work, the faithful people of God will partake of that
          glory. It is the latter rain which revives and strengthens them to pass through the time of trouble. Their
          faces will shine with the glory of that light which attends the third angel.</p>
      <p>I saw that God will in a wonderful manner preserve His people through the time of trouble. As Jesus poured out
          His soul in agony in the garden, they will earnestly cry and agonize day and night for deliverance. The decree
          will go forth that they must disregard the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and honor the ﬁrst day, or lose
          their lives; but they will not yield, and trample under their feet the Sabbath of the Lord, and honor an
          institution of papacy. Satan’s host and wicked men will surround them, and exult over them, because there will
          seem to be no way of escape for them. But in the midst of their revelry and triumph, there is heard peal upon
          peal of the loudest thunder. The heavens have gathered blackness, and are only illuminated by the blazing
          light and terrible glory from heaven, as God utters His voice from His holy habitation.</p>
      <p>The foundations of the earth shake; buildings totter and fall with a terrible crash. The sea boils like a pot,
          and the whole earth is in terrible commotion. The captivity of the righteous is turned, and with sweet and
          solemn whisperings they say to each other, “We are delivered. It is the voice of God.” With solemn awe they
          listen to the words of the <nobr>voice.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 1:353, 354.</p>
