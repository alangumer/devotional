    <h1>Placing Self Aside</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Philippians 3:7.</strong></p>
      <p>It is through the church that the <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> love of Jesus is to be made manifest to the
          world; but by the present example of the church the character of Christ is misrepresented, and a false
          conception of Him is given to the world. <nobr>Self-love</nobr> excludes the love of Jesus from the soul, and
          this is why there is not in the church greater zeal and more fervent love for Him who ﬁrst loved us. Self is
          supreme in so many hearts. Their thoughts, their time, their money, are given to
          <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation,</nobr> while souls for whom Christ died are perishing.</p>
      <p>This is why the Lord cannot impart to His church the fullness of His blessing. To honor them in a distinguished
          manner before the world would be to put His seal upon their works, conﬁrming their false representation of His
          character. When the church shall come out from the world, and be separate from its maxims, habits, and
          practices, the Lord Jesus will work with His people; He will pour a large measure of His Spirit upon them, and
          the world will know that the Father loves them. Will the people of God continue to be so stupeﬁed with
          selﬁshness? His blessing hangs over them, but it cannot be bestowed in its fullness because they are so
          corrupted with the spirit and practices of the world. There is spiritual pride among them; and should the Lord
          work as His heart longs to do, it would but conﬁrm them in their <nobr>self-esteem</nobr> and
          <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr></p>
      <p>Shall Christ continue to be misrepresented by our people? Shall the grace of God, the divine enlightenment, be
          shut away from His church, because of their lukewarmness? It will be, unless there is most thorough seeking of
          God, renunciation of the world, and humbling of the soul before God. The converting power of God must pass
          through our <nobr>churches.—The</nobr> Home Missionary, November 1, 1890.</p>
