    <h1>Theophanies: Divine Presence With Humans</h1>

      <p><strong>And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a ﬂame of ﬁre out of the midst of a bush: and he looked,
          and, behold, the bush burned with ﬁre, and the bush was not consumed. Exodus 3:2.</strong></p>
      <p>Friday, March 20 [1896], I arose early, about half past three o’clock in the morning. While [I was] writing
          upon the ﬁfteenth chapter of John suddenly a wonderful peace came upon me. The whole room seemed to be ﬁlled
          with the atmosphere of heaven. A holy, sacred Presence seemed to be in my room. I laid down my pen and was in
          a waiting attitude to see what the Spirit would say unto me. I saw no person. I heard no audible voice, but a
          heavenly Watcher seemed close beside me; I felt that I was in the presence of Jesus.</p>
      <p>The sweet peace and light which seemed to be in my room it is impossible for me to explain or describe. A
          sacred, holy atmosphere surrounded me, and there were presented to my mind and understanding matters of
          intense interest and importance. A line of action was laid out before me as if the unseen Presence was
          speaking with me. The matter I had been writing upon seemed to be lost to my mind and another matter
          distinctly opened before me. A great awe seemed to be upon me as matters were imprinted upon my
          <nobr>mind.—Selected</nobr> Messages 3:35, 36.</p>
      <p>I arose early Thursday morning, about two o’clock, and was writing busily upon [the subject of] the True Vine,
          when I felt a Presence in my room, as I have many times before, and I lost all recollection of what I was
          about. I seemed to be in the presence of Jesus. He was communicating to me that in which I was to be
          instructed. Everything was so plain that I could not <nobr>misunderstand.—Selected</nobr> Messages 3:36.</p>
