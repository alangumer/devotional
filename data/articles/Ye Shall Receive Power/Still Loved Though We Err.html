    <h1>Still Loved Though We Err</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an
          advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 1 John 2:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who are in connection with God are channels for the power of the Holy Spirit. If one who daily communes
          with God errs from the path, if he turns a moment from looking steadfastly unto Jesus, it is not because he
          sins willfully; for when he sees his mistake, he turns again, and fastens his eyes upon Jesus, and the fact
          that he has erred does not make him less dear to the heart of God. He knows that he has communion with the
          Saviour; and when reproved for his mistake in some matter of judgment, he does not walk sullenly, and complain
          of God, but turns the mistake into a victory. He learns a lesson from the words of the Master, and takes heed
          that he be not again deceived.</p>
      <p>Those who truly love God have internal evidence that they are beloved of God, that they have communion with
          Christ, that their hearts are warmed with fervent love toward Him. The truth for this time is believed with
          sound conﬁdence. They can say with all assurance, “We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
          known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.... We have
          also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a</p>
      <p>light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts” (2 Peter
          <nobr>1:16-19).</nobr> The inner life of the soul will reveal itself in the outward conduct. Let the Word of
          God bear its testimony in behalf of the messenger whom God hath sent with a message in these last days to
          prepare a people to stand</p>
      <p>in the day of the Lord. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
          publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God
          reigneth!” (Isaiah 52:7).</p>
      <p>The wisdom of <nobr>so-called</nobr> intellectual men cannot be relied upon, unless they have learned and are
          daily learning lessons in the school of Christ. Men, in their supposed wisdom, may plan and devise theories
          and systems of philosophy, but the Lord calls them vain and foolish. The Lord says, “The foolishness of God is
          wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men” (1 Corinthians <nobr>1:25).—The</nobr> Review
          and Herald, May 12, 1896.</p>
