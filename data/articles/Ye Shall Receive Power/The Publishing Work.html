    <h1>The Publishing Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
          Revelation 10:11.</strong></p>
      <p>Our publishing work was established by the direction of God and under His special supervision. It was designed
          to accomplish a speciﬁc purpose. <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists have been chosen by God as a peculiar
          people, separate from the world. By the great cleaver of truth He has cut them out from the quarry of the
          world and brought them into connection with Himself. He has made them His representatives and has called them
          to be ambassadors for Him in the last work of salvation. The greatest wealth of truth ever entrusted to
          mortals, the most solemn and fearful warnings ever sent by God to man, have been committed to them to be given
          to the world; and in the accomplishment of this work our publishing houses are among the most effective
          agencies.</p>
      <p>These institutions are to stand as witnesses for God, teachers of righteousness to the people. From them truth
          is to go forth as a lamp that burneth. Like a great light in a lighthouse on a dangerous coast, they are
          constantly to send forth beams of light into the darkness of the world, to warn men of the dangers that
          threaten them with destruction.</p>
      <p>The publications sent forth from our printing houses are to prepare a people to meet God. Throughout the world
          they are to do the same work that was done by John the Baptist for the Jewish nation. By startling messages of
          warning, God’s prophet awakened men from worldly dreaming. Through him God called backsliding Israel to
          repentance. By his presentation of truth he exposed popular delusions. In contrast with the false theories of
          his time, truth in his teaching stood forth as an eternal certainty. “Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is
          at hand,” was John’s message (Matthew 3:2). This same message, through the publications from our printing
          houses, is to be given to the world <nobr>today.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 7:138, 139.</p>
