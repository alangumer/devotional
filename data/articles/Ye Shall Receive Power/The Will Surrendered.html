    <h1>The Will Surrendered</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Philippians 2:13.
          Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the promise belongs to us as much
          as</strong></p>
      <p>to the ﬁrst disciples. But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many who believe and
          profess to claim the Lord’s promise; they talk about Christ and the Holy Spirit, yet receive no beneﬁt. They
          do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by divine agencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The
          Spirit is to use us. Through the Spirit God works in His people “to will and to do of his good pleasure.” But
          many will not submit to this. They want to manage themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly
          gift.</p>
      <p>Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of
          God awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in
          its train. It is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul
          according to the capacity to receive.</p>
      <p>When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away,
          evil deeds are renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the
          place of sadness, and the countenance reﬂects the joy of heaven. No one sees the hand that lifts the burden,
          or beholds the light descend from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders
          itself to God. Then that power which no human eye can see creates a new being in the image of God.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation
          of the life of Christ. [The Spirit] imbues the receiver with the attributes of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review
          and Herald, November 19, 1908.</p>
