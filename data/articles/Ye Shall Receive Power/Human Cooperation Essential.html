    <h1>Human Cooperation Essential</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in
          whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they
          hear without a preacher? Romans 10:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>God has expended amazing sacriﬁces upon men, and mighty energies for the reclaiming of man from transgression
          and sin to loyalty and obedience; but I have been shown that He does nothing without the cooperation of human
          agencies. Every endowment of grace and power and efﬁciency has been liberally provided, and the strongest
          motives presented to arouse and keep living in the human heart the missionary spirit, that divine and human
          agency may be combined....</p>
      <p>What use have you made of the gift of God? He has supplied the motive forces of which He has made a lodgment in
          your hearts, that with patience and hope and untiring vigilance you might set forth Jesus Christ and Him
          cruciﬁed, that you might send the note of warning that Christ is coming the second time with power and great
          glory, calling men to repent of their sins....</p>
      <p>How did the Holy Spirit work upon your hearts? By the energies of the Holy Spirit it was stimulating you to the
          exercise of the talents God has given you, that every man and woman and youth should employ them to set forth
          the truth for this time, making personal efforts, going into the cities where truth has never been and lifting
          the standard. In the blessing God has bestowed upon you, have not your energies been quickened, and the truth
          been more deeply impressed upon your soul, and its important relation to perishing souls out of Christ? Are ye
          witnesses for Christ in a more distinct and decided manner, after the manifest revealing of God’s blessing
          upon you?</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit’s ofﬁce is to bring decidedly to your minds the important, vital truths. Is this extra
          endowment to be bound up in a napkin and hidden in the earth? No, no, it is to be put out to the exchangers;
          and as man uses his talents, however small, the Holy Spirit takes the things of God, and presents them anew to
          the mind. He makes the neglected Word to be a vivifying agency. Through the Spirit, it is quick and powerful
          upon human minds, not because of the smartness, the educational power of the human agency, but because the
          divine power works with the human, and to the divine belongs all the <nobr>credit.—The</nobr> Home Missionary,
          November 1, 1893.</p>
