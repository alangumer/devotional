    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but
          perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see
          with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. Isaiah
          6:9, 10.</strong></p>
      <p>The prophet’s duty was plain; he was to lift his voice in protest against the prevailing evils. But he dreaded
          to undertake the work without some assurance of hope. “Lord, how long?” (Isaiah 6:11) he inquired. Are none of
          Thy chosen people ever to understand, and repent, and be healed?</p>
      <p>His burden of soul in behalf of erring Judah was not to be borne in vain. His mission was not to be wholly
          fruitless. Yet the evils that had been multiplying for many generations could not be removed in his day.
          Throughout his lifetime he must be a patient, courageous <nobr>teacher—a</nobr> prophet of hope as well as of
          doom. The divine purpose ﬁnally accomplished, the full fruitage of his efforts, and of the labors of all God’s
          faithful messengers, would appear. A remnant should be saved. That this might be brought about, the messages
          of warning and entreaty were to be delivered to the rebellious, the Lord declared, “until the cities be wasted
          without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed
          men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land” (verses 11, 12).</p>
      <p>The heavy judgments that were to befall the <nobr>impenitent—war,</nobr> exile, oppression, the loss of power
          and prestige among the <nobr>nations—all</nobr> these were to come in order that those who would recognize in
          them the hand of an offended God might be led to repent. The ten tribes of the northern kingdom were soon to
          be scattered among the nations, and their cities left desolate; the destroying armies of hostile nations were
          to sweep over their land again and again; even Jerusalem was ﬁnally to fall, and Judah was to be carried away
          captive; yet the Promised Land was not to remain wholly forsaken <nobr>forever.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          March 11, 1915.</p>
