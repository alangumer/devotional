    <h1>Benevolence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for
          God loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all
          sufﬁciency in all things, may abound to every good work. 2 Corinthians 9:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>When the hearts of men are softened by the presence of the Spirit of God, they are more susceptible to
          impressions of the Holy Spirit, and resolves are made to deny self and to sacriﬁce for the cause of God. It is
          when divine light shines into the chambers of the mind with unusual clearness and power that the feelings of
          the natural man are overcome, that selﬁshness loses its power upon the heart, and that desires are awakened to
          imitate the Pattern, Jesus Christ, in practicing <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and benevolence. The disposition of
          the naturally selﬁsh man then becomes kind and pitiful toward lost sinners, and he makes a solemn pledge to
          God, as did Abraham and Jacob.</p>
      <p>Heavenly angels are present on such occasions. The love of God and love for souls triumphs over selﬁshness and
          love of the world. Especially is this the case when the speaker, in the Spirit and power of God, presents the
          plan of redemption, laid by the Majesty of heaven in the sacriﬁce of the cross....</p>
      <p>God has given man a part to act in accomplishing the salvation of His fellow men. He can work in connection
          with Christ by doing acts of mercy and beneﬁcence. But he cannot redeem them, not being able to satisfy the
          claims of insulted justice. This the Son of God alone can do, by laying aside His honor and glory, clothing
          His divinity with humanity, and coming to earth to humiliate Himself and shed His blood in behalf of the human
          race.</p>
      <p>In commissioning His disciples to go “into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark
          16:15), Christ assigned to men the work of spreading the gospel. But while some go forth to preach, He calls
          upon others to answer to His claims upon them for tithes and offerings with which to support the ministry and
          to spread the printed truth all over the <nobr>land.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church
          <nobr>4:470-472.</nobr></p>
