    <h1>Capable to Distinguish False Theories</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to
          write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto
          the saints. Jude 1:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Jude bears this message to guard believers against the seductive inﬂuence of false teachers, men who have a
          form of godliness but who are not safe leaders. In these last days, false teachers will arise and become
          actively zealous. All kinds of theories will be presented to divert the minds of men and women from the very
          truth that deﬁnes the position we can occupy with safety in this time when Satan is working with power upon
          religionists, leading them to make a pretense of being righteous, but to fail of placing themselves under the
          guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>False theories will be mingled with every phase of experience, and advocated with satanic earnestness in order
          to captivate the mind of every soul who is not rooted and grounded in a full knowledge of the sacred
          principles of the Word. In the very midst of us will arise false teachers, giving heed to seducing spirits
          whose doctrines are of satanic origin. These teachers will draw away disciples after themselves. Creeping in
          unawares, they will use ﬂattering words, and make skillful misrepresentations with seductive tact.</p>
      <p>The only hope of our churches is to keep wide awake. Those who are well grounded in the truth of the Word,
          those who test everything by a “Thus saith the Lord” are safe. The Holy Spirit will guide those who prize the
          wisdom of God above the deceptive sophistries of satanic agencies. Let there be much praying, not in human
          lines but under the inspiration of love of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. The families who believe the
          truth are to speak words of wisdom and <nobr>intelligence—words</nobr> that will come to them as the result of
          searching the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>Now is our time of test and trial. Now is the time when the members of every believing family must close their
          lips against speaking words of accusation concerning their brethren. Let them speak words that impart courage,
          and strengthen the faith which works by love and puriﬁes the <nobr>soul.—The</nobr> Kress Collection, 5.</p>
