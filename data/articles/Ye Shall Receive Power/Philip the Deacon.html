      <p><strong>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip ran thither to
          him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? Acts 8:29,
          30.</strong></p>
      <p>God is looking down from His throne, and is sending His angels to this earth to cooperate with those who are
          teaching the truth. Read the record of the experience of Philip and the eunuch. “The angel of the Lord spake
          unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
          which is desert. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under
          Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to
          worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet” (Acts
          <nobr>8:26-28)....</nobr></p>
      <p>This incident shows the care that the Lord has over every mind that is susceptible to the truth. We see how
          closely the ministration of heavenly angels is connected with the work of the Lord’s servants on this
          earth.</p>
      <p>A burden was placed upon Philip to enter new places, to break up fresh ground. Direction was given him by an
          angel who was watching for every opportunity to bring men into connection with their fellow men. Philip was
          sent “toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert” (verse 26).
          This brought him into touch with a man of wide inﬂuence, who, when converted, would communicate to others the
          light of truth. By the Lord’s working through Philip, the man was convinced of the truth, and was converted
          and baptized. He was a highway hearer, a man of good standing, who would exert a strong inﬂuence in favor of
          the truth.</p>
      <p>Today, as then, angels of heaven are waiting to lead men to their fellow men. An angel showed Philip where to
          ﬁnd this man, who was so ready to receive the truth, and today angels of God will guide and direct the
          footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and reﬁne and ennoble
          their <nobr>hearts.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 20, 1905.</p>
