      <p><strong>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
          Jesus. Revelation 14:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its
          opening. The prophecies which were fulﬁlled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel
          are again to be fulﬁlled in the latter rain at its close. Here are “the times of refreshing” to which the
          apostle Peter looked forward when he said: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
          blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus
          Christ, which before was preached unto you” (Acts 3:19, 20).</p>
      <p>Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten from place to
          place to proclaim the message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be
          given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers.
          Satan also works, with lying wonders, even bringing down ﬁre from heaven in the sight of men. (Revelation
          13:13). Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their stand.</p>
      <p>The message will be carried not so much by argument as by the deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The
          arguments have been presented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and bear fruit. The
          publications distributed by missionary workers have exerted their inﬂuence, yet many whose minds were
          impressed have been prevented from fully comprehending the truth or from yielding obedience. Now the rays of
          light penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever the bands
          which have held them. Family connections, church relations, are powerless to stay them now. Truth is more
          precious than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a large number take their
          stand upon the Lord’s <nobr>side.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 611, 612.</p>
