    <h1>With Empty Vessels</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not
          of us. 2 Corinthians 4:7.</strong></p>
      <p>The question has been asked, What kind of vessels does the Spirit use? What does Christ <nobr>say?—“Come</nobr>
          unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of
          me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my
          burden is light” (Matthew <nobr>11:28-30).</nobr> What kind of vessels are meet for the Master’s
          <nobr>use?—Empty</nobr> vessels. When we empty the soul of every deﬁlement, we are ready for use.</p>
      <p>Are we emptied of self? Are we cured of selﬁsh planning? Oh, for less <nobr>self-occupation!</nobr> May the
          Lord purify His people, teachers, and churches. He has given a rule for the guidance of all, and from this
          there can be no careless departure. But there has been, and still is, a swerving from righteous principles.
          How long shall this condition of things exist? How can the Master use us as vessels for holy service until we
          empty ourselves, and make room for His Spirit to work?</p>
      <p>God calls for His people to reveal Him. Shall the world manifest principles of integrity that the church does
          not maintain? Shall a selﬁsh ambition to be ﬁrst be shown by the followers of Christ? Shall not the principles
          cherished by them be laid upon the true foundation, even Christ Jesus? What material shall we place upon this
          foundation, that there may no longer be antagonism, but unity, in the church? Shall we bring to it wood, hay,
          stubble? Shall we not rather bring the most precious <nobr>material—gold,</nobr> silver, precious stones?
          Shall we not distinguish sharply between the chaff and the wheat? Shall we not realize that we must receive
          the Holy Spirit in our hearts, that it may mold and fashion the life?</p>
      <p>We are living in perilous times. In the fear of God I would say that the true exposition of the Scriptures is
          necessary for the correct moral development of our characters. When mind and heart are worked by the Spirit,
          when self is dead, the truth is capable of constant expansion and new development. When the truth molds our
          characters, it will be seen to be truth <nobr>indeed.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, February 28, 1899.</p>
