    <h1>Trials and Opposition Bring Beneﬁt</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the ﬁery trial which is to try you, as though some strange
          thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his
          glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. 1 Peter 4:12, 13.</strong></p>
      <p>The opposition we meet may prove a beneﬁt to us in many ways. If it is well borne, it will develop virtues
          which would never have appeared if the Christian had nothing to endure. And faith, patience, forbearance,
          heavenly mindedness, trust in Providence, and genuine sympathy with the erring, are the results of trial well
          borne. These are the graces of the Spirit, which bud, blossom, and bear fruit amid trials and adversity.
          Meekness, humility, and love always grow on the Christian tree. If the word is received into good and honest
          hearts, the obdurate soul will be subdued, and faith, grasping the promises, and relying upon Jesus, will
          prove triumphant. “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith” (1 John 5:4).</p>
      <p>He who opens the Scriptures, and feeds upon the heavenly manna, becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He has
          no life or experience apart from Christ. He hears the voice of God speaking from heaven, “This is my beloved
          Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17). That voice is assurance to him that he is accepted in the
          Beloved. And he knows that in character he must be like Him with whom God is well pleased. God has fully
          accepted Christ as our substitute, our surety; then let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from all
          iniquity, and be one with Christ in character, that Jesus may not be ashamed to call us brethren.</p>
      <p>He in whom we trust has proved Himself a present help in every time of need; and as we dwell with Him, we grow
          more and more into His image. “We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
          changed into the same image from glory to glory [which means from character to character] even as by the
          Spirit of the Lord” (2 Corinthians 3:18). “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
          shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2
          Corinthians <nobr>4:6).—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 28, 1892.</p>
