    <h1>Abraham</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy
          shield, and thy exceeding great reward.... And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look</strong></p>
      <p>now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed
          be. And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness. Genesis <nobr>15:1-6.</nobr></p>
      <p>God designed that Abraham should be a channel of light and blessing, that he should have a gathering inﬂuence,
          and that God should have a people on the earth. Abraham was to be in the world, reﬂecting in his life the
          character of Jesus. When he received the divine call, Abraham was not a man of renown, neither a lawgiver, nor
          a conqueror. He was a simple herdsman, dwelling in tents, but employing a large number of workmen to carry on
          his humble employment. And the honor which he received was because of his faithfulness to God, his strict
          integrity and just dealing.</p>
      <p>The Lord said of him: “Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; seeing that Abraham shall surely become
          a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? For I know him, that he
          will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice
          and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him” (Genesis
          <nobr>18:17-19).</nobr></p>
      <p>Abraham’s unselﬁsh life made him indeed a “spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men” (1 Corinthians
          4:9). And the Lord declared He would bless those who blessed Abraham, and that He would punish those who
          misused or injured him. Through Abraham’s experience in his religious life a correct knowledge of Jehovah has
          been communicated to thousands; and his light will shed its beams all along the path of those who practice the
          piety, the faith, the devotion, and the obedience of Abraham.</p>
      <p>Abraham had a knowledge of Christ; for the Lord had enlightened him in regard to the world’s Redeemer. And he
          made known to his household and his children that the sacriﬁcial offerings preﬁgured Christ, the Lamb of God,
          who was to be slain for the sins of the world. Thus he gathered converts to believe in the only true and
          living <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Youth’s Instructor, March 4, 1897.</p>
