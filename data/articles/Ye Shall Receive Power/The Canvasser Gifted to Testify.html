    <h1>The Canvasser Gifted to Testify</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by
          the lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept back nothing that was proﬁtable unto you, but have shewed you,
          and have taught you publickly, and from house to house. Acts 20:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>From the light which God has given me, there is much responsibility resting upon the canvassers. They should go
          to their work prepared to explain the Scriptures, and nothing should be said or done to bind their hands. If
          they put their trust in the Lord as they travel from place to place, the angels of God will be round about
          them, giving them words to speak which will bring light and hope and courage to many souls. Were it not for
          the work of the canvassers, many would never hear the truth.</p>
      <p>Of all the gifts which God has given to man, none is more noble or a greater blessing than the gift of speech,
          if it is sanctiﬁed by the Holy Spirit. It is with the tongue we convince and persuade; with it we offer prayer
          and praise to God, and with it we convey rich thoughts of the Redeemer’s love. By this work the canvasser can
          scatter the seeds of truth, causing the light from the Word of God to shine into many minds.</p>
      <p>I sincerely hope that no mind will receive the impression that it belittles a minister of the gospel to
          canvass. Hear the apostle Paul’s testimony: “Ye know, from the ﬁrst day that I came into Asia, after what
          manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears,
          and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept back nothing that was
          proﬁtable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, testifying
          both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts
          <nobr>20:18-21).</nobr> The eloquent Paul, to whom God manifested Himself in a remarkable manner, went from
          house to house, with all humility of mind, and with many tears and <nobr>temptations.—The</nobr> Home
          Missionary, November 1, 1896.</p>
