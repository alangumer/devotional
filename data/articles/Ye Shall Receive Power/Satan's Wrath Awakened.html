    <h1>Satan’s Wrath Awakened</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary
          the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. 1 Peter 5:7, 8.</strong></p>
      <p>If the world is to be convinced of sin as transgressors of God’s law, the agency must be the Holy Spirit
          working through human instrumentalities. The church needs now to shake off her deathlike slumber; for the Lord
          is waiting to bless His people who will recognize the blessing when it comes, and diffuse it in clear, strong
          rays of light. “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean.... And I will put my</p>
      <p>spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes” (Ezekiel <nobr>36:25-27).</nobr></p>
      <p>If the wilderness of the church is to become as a fruitful ﬁeld, and the fruitful ﬁeld to be as a forest, it is
          through the Holy Spirit of God poured out upon His people. The heavenly agencies have long been waiting for
          the human agents, the members of the church, to cooperate with them in the great work to be done. They are
          waiting for you. So vast is the ﬁeld, so comprehensive the design, that every sanctiﬁed heart will be pressed
          into service as an agent of divine power.</p>
      <p>At the same time there will be a power stirring everything from beneath. The working of evil angels will be
          manifest in deceptions, delusions, in calamities, and in casualties and crimes of no ordinary character. While
          God employs the angels of mercy to work through His human agents, Satan sets his agencies in operation, laying
          under tribute all the powers that submit to his control. There will be lords many and gods many. The cry will
          be heard, “Lo, here is Christ” and “Lo, He is there.” The deep plotting of Satan will reveal its workings
          everywhere, for the purpose of distracting attention from present duty. The appearance of a false Christ will
          awaken delusive hopes in the minds of those who will allow themselves to be deceived. The church members that
          are awake will arise to the emergency, and manifestations of satanic power are to be presented in their true
          light before the <nobr>people.—General</nobr> Conference Daily Bulletin, February 28, 1893.</p>
