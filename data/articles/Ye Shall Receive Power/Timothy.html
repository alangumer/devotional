    <h1>Timothy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead
          at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
          exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 2 Timothy 4:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>This solemn charge to one so zealous and faithful as was Timothy is a strong testimony to the importance and
          responsibility of the work of the gospel minister. Summoning Timothy before the bar of God, Paul bids him
          preach the Word, not the sayings and customs of men; to be ready to witness for God whenever opportunity
          should present <nobr>itself—before</nobr> large congregations and private circles, by the way and at the
          ﬁreside, to friends and to enemies, whether in safety or exposed to hardship and peril, reproach and
          loss.</p>
      <p>Fearing that Timothy’s mild, yielding disposition might lead him to shun an essential part of his work, Paul
          exhorted him to be faithful in reproving sin and even to rebuke with sharpness those who are guilty of gross
          evils. Yet he was to do this “with all longsuffering and doctrine.” He was to reveal the patience and love of
          Christ, explaining and enforcing his reproofs by the truths of the Word.</p>
      <p>To hate and reprove sin, and at the same time to show pity and tenderness for the sinner, is a difﬁcult
          attainment. The more earnest our own efforts to attain to holiness of heart and life, the more acute will be
          our perception of sin and the more decided our disapproval of any deviation from the right. We must guard
          against undue severity toward the wrongdoer, but we must also be careful not to lose sight of the exceeding
          sinfulness of sin. There is need of showing Christlike patience and love for the erring one, but there is also
          danger of showing so great toleration for his error that he will look upon himself as undeserving of reproof,
          and will reject it as uncalled for and <nobr>unjust.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 503, 504.</p>
