    <h1>Dry Bones Viviﬁed</h1>

      <p><strong>And [I] shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then
          shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord. Ezekiel 37:14.</strong></p>
      <p>It is not the human agent that is to inspire with life. The Lord God of Israel will do that part, quickening
          the lifeless spiritual nature into activity. The breath of the Lord of hosts must enter into the lifeless
          bodies. In the judgment, when all secrets are laid bare, it will be known that the voice of God spoke through
          the human agent, and aroused the torpid conscience, and stirred the lifeless faculties, and moved sinners to
          repentance and contrition, and forsaking of sins. It will then be clearly seen that through the human agent
          faith in Jesus Christ was imparted to the soul, and spiritual life from heaven was breathed upon one who was
          dead in trespasses and sins, and he was quickened with spiritual life.</p>
      <p>But not only does this simile of the dry bones apply to the world, but also to those who have been blessed with
          great light; for they also are like the skeletons of the valley. They have the form of men, the framework of
          the body; but they have not spiritual life. But the parable does not leave the dry bones merely knit together
          into the forms of men; for it is not enough that there is symmetry of limb and feature. The breath of life
          must vivify the bodies, that they may stand upright, and spring into activity. These bones represent the house
          of Israel, the church of God, and the hope of the church is the vivifying inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit. The
          Lord must breathe upon the dry bones, that they may live.</p>
      <p>The Spirit of God, with its vivifying power, must be in every human agent, that every spiritual muscle and
          sinew may be in exercise. Without the Holy Spirit, without the breath of God, there is torpidity of
          conscience, loss of spiritual life. Many who are without spiritual life have their names on the church
          records, but they are not written in the Lamb’s book of life. They may be joined to the church, but they are
          not united to the Lord. They may be diligent in the performance of a certain set of duties, and may be
          regarded as living men; but many are among those who have “a name that thou livest, and art dead” (Revelation
          <nobr>3:1).—&lt;span</nobr><nobr>class=[U+0094]egw-eng[U+0094]title=[U+0094]4BC</nobr> 1165.4[U+0094]&gt;The
