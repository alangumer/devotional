    <h1>Living Water to be Shared</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I
          shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. John 4:14.</strong></p>
      <p>As the plan of redemption begins and ends with a gift, so it is to be carried forward. The same spirit of
          sacriﬁce which purchased salvation for us will dwell in the hearts of all who become partakers of the heavenly
          gift. Says the apostle Peter: “As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another,
          as good stewards of the manifold grace of God” (1 Peter 4:10). Said Jesus to His disciples as He sent them
          forth, “Freely ye have received, freely give” (Matthew 10:8). In him who is fully in sympathy with Christ,
          there can be nothing selﬁsh or exclusive. He who drinks of the living water will ﬁnd that it is “in him a well
          of water springing up into everlasting life.” The Spirit of Christ within him is like a spring welling up in
          the desert, ﬂowing to refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish eager to drink of the water of
          life.</p>
      <p>It was the same spirit of love and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> which dwelt in Christ that impelled the apostle
          Paul to his manifold labors. “I am debtor,” he says, “both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians; both to the
          wise, and to the unwise” (Romans 1:14). “Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
          given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ” (Ephesians 3:8).</p>
      <p>Our Lord designed that His church should reﬂect to the world the fullness and sufﬁciency that we ﬁnd in Him. We
          are constantly receiving of God’s bounty, and by imparting of the same we are to represent to the world the
          love and beneﬁcence of Christ. While all heaven is astir, dispatching messengers to all parts of the earth to
          carry forward the work of redemption, the church of the living God are also to be <nobr>co-laborers</nobr>
          with Jesus Christ. We are members of His mystical body. He is the Head, controlling all the members of the
          body. Jesus Himself, in His inﬁnite mercy, is working on human hearts, effecting spiritual transformations so
          amazing that angels look on with astonishment and <nobr>joy.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 24,
          1908.</p>
