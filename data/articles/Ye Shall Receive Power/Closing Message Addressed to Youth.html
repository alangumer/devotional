    <h1>Closing Message Addressed to Youth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good ﬁght, I
          have ﬁnished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
          which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also
          that love his appearing. 2 Timothy <nobr>4:6-8.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>I do not expect to live long. My work is nearly done. Tell our young people that I want my words to encourage
          them in that manner of life that will be most attractive to the heavenly intelligences, and that their
          inﬂuence upon others may be most ennobling.</p>
      <p>In the night season I was selecting and laying aside books that are of no advantage to the young. We should
          select for them books that will encourage them to sincerity of life, and lead them to the opening of the Word.
          This has been presented to me in the past, and I thought I would get it before you and make it secure. We
          cannot afford to give to young people valueless reading. Books that are a blessing to mind and soul are
          needed. These things are too lightly regarded; therefore our people should become acquainted with what I am
          saying.</p>
      <p>I do not think I shall have more testimonies for our people. Our men of solid minds know what is good for the
          uplifting and upbuilding of the work. But with the love of God in their hearts, they need to go deeper and
          deeper into the study of the things of God. I am very anxious that our young people shall have the proper
          class of reading; then the old people will get it also. We must keep our eyes on the religious attraction of
          the truth. We are to keep mind and brain open to the truths of God’s Word. Satan comes when men are unaware.
          We are not to be satisﬁed because the message of warning has been once presented. We must present it again and
          <nobr>again.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 15, 1915.</p>
