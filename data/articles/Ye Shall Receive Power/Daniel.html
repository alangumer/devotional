    <h1>Daniel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole
          province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. Daniel 2:48.</strong></p>
      <p>A confession of Christ means something more than bearing testimony in social meeting. Daniel is an example to
          believers as to what it means to confess Christ. He held the responsible position of prime minister in the
          kingdom of Babylon, and there were those who were envious of Daniel among the great men of the court, and they
          wanted to ﬁnd something against him that they might bring an accusation against him to the king. But he was a
          faithful statesman, and they could ﬁnd no ﬂaw in his character or life.</p>
      <p>“Then said these men, we shall not ﬁnd any occasion against this Daniel, except we ﬁnd it against him
          concerning the law of his God” (Daniel 6:5). So they agreed together to ask the king to make a decree that no
          one should ask any petition of any God or man for thirty days save of the king, and if any disobeyed this
          decree, he was to be cast into the den of lions.</p>
      <p>But did Daniel cease to pray because this decree was to go into force? No, that was just the time when he
          needed to pray. “When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being
          open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks
          before his God, as he did aforetime” Daniel did not seek to hide his loyalty to God. He did not pray in his
          heart, but with his voice, aloud, with his window open toward Jerusalem, he offered up his petition to
          heaven....</p>
      <p>We may know that if our life is hid with Christ in God, when we are brought into trial because of our faith,
          Jesus will be with us. When we are brought before rulers and dignitaries to answer for our faith, the Spirit
          of the Lord will illuminate our understanding, and we shall be able to bear a testimony to the glory of God.
          And if we are called to suffer for Christ’s sake, we shall be able to go to prison trusting in Him as a little
          child trusts in its parents. Now is the time to cultivate faith in <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          May 3, 1892.</p>
