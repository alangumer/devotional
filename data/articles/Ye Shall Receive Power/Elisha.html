      <p><strong>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for
          thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be
          upon me. 2 Kings 2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>We may learn valuable lessons from the experience of the prophet Elisha. Elisha was chosen by the Lord as
          Elijah’s helper, and through test and trial he proved himself true to his trust. He was willing to be and do
          anything the Lord directed. He did not seek to shun the humblest service, but was as faithful in the
          performance of smaller duties as of larger responsibilities. He was always willing to serve in any position to
          which the Lord pointed him, however disagreeable it might be to his natural inclinations. And at every step he
          learned lessons of humility and service....</p>
      <p>“And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee,
          before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon
          me.” He did not ask for worldly honor, for a high place among the great men of the earth. That for which he
          craved was a double portion of the Spirit given to the one God was about to honor with translation. He knew
          that nothing but a double portion of the Spirit that had rested on Elijah could ﬁt him to ﬁll the place Elijah
          had ﬁlled, because Elijah had the experience and wisdom of age, which cannot by any method be imparted to the
          young....</p>
      <p>When the Lord in His providence sees ﬁt to remove from His work those to whom He has given wisdom, He helps and
          strengthens their successors, if they will look to Him for aid and will walk in His ways. They may be even
          wiser than their predecessors; for they may proﬁt by their experience and learn wisdom from their
          mistakes.</p>
      <p>The Lord has a special care for His church. Those who will seek wisdom from Him will be lights in the world,
          shining brighter and brighter unto the perfect <nobr>day.—Manuscript</nobr> 114, 1901.</p>
