      <p><strong>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest
          darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. John
          12:35.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus says, “Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.” Gather up every ray, pass not one by.
          Walk in the light. Practice every precept of truth presented to you. Live by every word that proceedeth out of
          the mouth of God, and you will then follow Jesus wherever He goeth. When the Lord presents evidence upon
          evidence and gives light upon light, why is it that souls hesitate to walk in the light? Why do men neglect to
          walk in light to a greater light?</p>
      <p>The Lord does not refuse to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him. When conviction comes home to the
          conscience, why not listen, and heed the voice of the Spirit of God? By every hesitation and delay, we place
          ourselves where it is more and more difﬁcult for us to accept the light of heaven, and at last it seems
          impossible to be impressed by admonitions and warnings. The sinner says, more and more easily, “Go thy way for
          this time; when I have a more convenient season, I will call for thee” (Acts 24:25).</p>
      <p>I know the danger of those who refuse to walk in the light as God gives it. They bring upon themselves the
          terrible crisis of being left to follow their own ways, to do after their own judgment. The conscience becomes
          less and less impressible. The voice of God seems to become more and more distant, and the wrongdoer is left
          to his own infatuation. In stubbornness he resists every appeal, despises all counsel and advice, and turns
          from every provision made for his salvation, and the voice of the messenger of God makes no impression upon
          his mind. The Spirit of God no longer exerts a restraining power over him, and the sentence is passed, “[He]
          is joined to idols, let him alone” (Hosea 4:17). Oh, how dark, how sullen, how obstinate, is his independence!
          It seems that the insensibility of death is upon his heart. This is the process through which the soul passes
          that rejects the working of the Holy <nobr>Spirit.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 29, 1897.</p>
