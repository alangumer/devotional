    <h1>A Burning Fire</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine
          heart as a burning ﬁre shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. Jeremiah
          20:9.</strong></p>
      <p>God will move upon men in humble positions to declare the message of present truth. Many such will be seen
          hastening hither and thither, constrained by the Spirit of God to give the light to those in darkness. The
          truth is as a ﬁre in their bones, ﬁlling them with a burning desire to enlighten those who sit in darkness.
          Many, even among the uneducated, will proclaim the Word of the Lord. Children will be impelled by the Holy
          Spirit to go forth to declare the message of heaven. The Spirit will be poured out upon those who yield to His
          promptings. Casting off man’s binding rules and cautious movements, they will join the army of the Lord.</p>
      <p>In the future, men in the common walks of life will be impressed by the Spirit of the Lord to leave their
          ordinary employment and go forth to proclaim the last message of mercy. As rapidly as possible they are to be
          prepared for labor, that success may crown their efforts. They cooperate with heavenly agencies, for they are
          willing to spend and be spent in the service of the Master. No one is authorized to hinder these workers. They
          are to be bidden Godspeed as they go forth to fulﬁll the great commission. No taunting word is to be spoken of
          them as in the rough places of the earth they sow the gospel seed.</p>
      <p>Life’s best <nobr>things—simplicity,</nobr> honesty, truthfulness, purity, unsullied
          <nobr>integrity—cannot</nobr> be bought or sold; they are as free to the ignorant as to the educated, to the
          black man as to the white man, to the humble peasant as to the king upon his throne. Humble workers, who do
          not trust in their own strength, but who labor in simplicity, trusting always in God, will share in the joy of
          the Saviour. Their persevering prayers will bring souls to the cross. In cooperation with their
          <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> efforts Jesus will move upon hearts, working miracles in the conversion of souls.
          Men and women will be gathered into church fellowship. Meetinghouses will be built and schools established.
          The hearts of the workers will be ﬁlled with joy as they see the salvation of <nobr>God.—Testimonies</nobr>
          for the Church <nobr>7:26-28.</nobr></p>
