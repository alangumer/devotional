    <h1>The Medical Ministry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and
          healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. Acts 10:38.</strong></p>
      <p>Our work is clearly deﬁned. As the Father sent His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son into our world, even so
          Christ sends us, His disciples, as His medical missionary workers. In fulﬁlling this high and holy mission, we
          are to do the will of God. No one man’s mind or judgment is to be our criterion of what constitutes genuine
          medical missionary work....</p>
      <p>True medical missionary work is of heavenly origin. It was not originated by any person who lives. But in
          connection with this work we see so much which dishonors God that I am instructed to say, The medical
          missionary work is of divine origin, and has a most glorious mission to fulﬁll. In all its bearings it is to
          be in conformity with Christ’s work. Those who are workers together with God will just as surely represent the
          character of Christ as Christ represented the character of His Father while in this world.</p>
      <p>I am instructed to say that God will have the medical missionary work cleansed from the tarnish of earthliness,
          and elevated to stand in its true position before the world. When schemes that imperil souls are brought into
          connection with this work, its inﬂuence is destroyed. This is why there have arisen in the carrying forward of
          medical missionary work many perplexities that demand our careful consideration....</p>
      <p>Nothing will help us more at this stage of our work than to understand and to fulﬁll the mission of the
          greatest Medical Missionary that ever trod the earth; nothing will help us more than to realize how sacred is
          this kind of work and how perfectly it corresponds with the lifework of the Great Missionary. The object of
          our mission is the same as the object of Christ’s mission. Why did God send His Son to the fallen world? To
          make known and to demonstrate to mankind His love for them. Christ came as a Redeemer. Throughout His ministry
          He was to keep prominent His mission to save <nobr>sinners.—Medical</nobr> Ministry, 24.</p>
