    <h1>Showers of Grace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give
          them showers of rain, to every one grass in the ﬁeld. Zechariah 10:1.</strong></p>
      <p>In the East the former rain falls at the sowing time. It is necessary in order that the seed may germinate.
          Under the inﬂuence of the fertilizing showers, the tender shoot springs up. The latter rain, falling near the
          close of the season, ripens the grain, and prepares it for the sickle. The Lord employs these operations of
          nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit. As the dew and the rain are given ﬁrst to cause the seed to
          germinate, and then to ripen the harvest, so the Holy Spirit is given to carry forward, from one stage to
          another, the process of spiritual growth. The ripening of the grain represents the completion of the work of
          God’s grace in the soul. By the power of the Holy Spirit the moral image of God is to be perfected in the
          character. We are to be wholly transformed into the likeness of Christ....</p>
      <p>Many have in a great measure failed to receive the former rain. They have not obtained all the beneﬁts that God
          has thus provided for them. They expect that the lack will be supplied by the latter rain. When the richest
          abundance of grace shall be bestowed, they intend to open their hearts to receive it. They are making a
          terrible mistake. The work that God has begun in the human heart in giving His light and knowledge must be
          continually going forward. Every individual must realize his own necessity. The heart must be emptied of every
          deﬁlement, and cleansed for the indwelling of the Spirit.</p>
      <p>It was by the confession and forsaking of sin, by earnest prayer and consecration of themselves to God, that
          the early disciples prepared for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. The same work,
          only in greater degree, must be done now. Then the human agent had only to ask for the blessing, and wait for
          the Lord to perfect the work concerning him. It is God who began the work, and He will ﬁnish His work, making
          man complete in Jesus Christ. But there must be no neglect of the grace represented by the former rain. Only
          those who are living up to the light they have will receive greater light. Unless we are daily advancing in
          the exempliﬁcation of the active Christian virtues, we shall not recognize the manifestations of the Holy
          Spirit in the latter <nobr>rain.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, March 2, 1897.</p>
