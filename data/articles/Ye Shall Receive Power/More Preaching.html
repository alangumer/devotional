      <p><strong>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost
          teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 1 Corinthians 2:13.</strong></p>
      <p>Just prior to His leaving His disciples for the heavenly courts, Jesus encouraged them with the promise of the
          Holy Spirit. This promise belongs as much to us as it did to them, and yet how rarely it is presented before
          the people, and its reception spoken of in the church.</p>
      <p>In consequence of this silence upon this most important theme, what promise do we know less about by its
          practical fulﬁllment than this rich promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit, whereby efﬁciency is to be given
          to all our spiritual labor? The promise of the Holy Spirit is casually brought into our discourses, is
          incidentally touched upon, and that is all. Prophecies have been dwelt upon, doctrines have been expounded;
          but that which is essential to the church in order that they may grow in spiritual strength and efﬁciency, in
          order that the preaching may carry conviction with it, and souls be converted to God, has been largely left
          out of ministerial effort.</p>
      <p>This subject has been set aside, as if some time in the future would be given to its consideration. Other
          blessings and privileges have been presented before the people until a desire has been awakened in the church
          for the attainment of the blessing promised of God; but the impression concerning the Holy Spirit has been
          that this gift is not for the church now, but that at some time in the future it would be necessary for the
          church to receive it.</p>
      <p>This promised blessing, if claimed by faith, would bring all other blessings in its train, and it is to be
          given liberally to the people of God. Through the cunning devices of the enemy the minds of God’s people seem
          to be incapable of comprehending and appropriating the promises of God.... A harvest of joy will be</p>
      <p>reaped by those who sow the holy seeds of truth. “He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
          doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him” (Psalm <nobr>126:6).—Testimonies</nobr> to
          Ministers and Gospel Workers, 174, 175.</p>
