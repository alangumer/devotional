    <h1>Not Relying on Our Own Imagination</h1>

      <p><strong>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the
          Spirit and of power. 1 Corinthians 2:4.</strong></p>
      <p>I have seen that danger attends every new phase of experience in the church, because some hear things with such
          a wrong spirit. While some teachers may be strong and efﬁcient in teaching in the lines of Bible doctrines,
          they will not all be men who have a knowledge of practical life, and can advise perplexed minds with surety
          and safety. They do not discern the perplexing situation that must necessarily come to every family who shall
          make a change. Therefore let all be careful what they say; if they know not the mind of God in some matters,
          let them never speak from a guess or suppose so. If they know nothing deﬁnite, let them say so, and let the
          individual rely wholly upon God. Let there be much praying done, and even with fasting, that not one shall
          move in darkness, but move in the light as God is in the light.</p>
      <p>We may look for anything now to break forth outside and within our ranks; and there are minds undisciplined by
          the grace of the Holy Spirit, that have not practiced the words of Christ, and who do not understand the
          movings of the Spirit of God, who will follow a wrong course of action because they do not follow Jesus fully.
          They follow impulse and their own imagination.</p>
      <p>Let there be nothing done in a disorderly manner, that there shall be a great loss or sacriﬁce made upon
          property because of ardent, impulsive speeches which stir up an enthusiasm which is not after the order of
          God, that a victory that was essential to be gained, shall, for lack of levelheaded moderation and proper
          contemplation, and sound principles and purposes, be turned into a defeat. Let there be wise generalship in
          this matter, and all move under the guidance of a wise, unseen Counselor, which is God. Elements that are
          human will struggle for the mastery, and there may be a work done that does not bear the signature of
          <nobr>God.—Special</nobr> Testimonies Relating to Various Matters in Battle Creek, pp. 17, 18.</p>
