    <h1>Pity and Compassion: God’s Spirit at Work</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he
          said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. Luke 10:36,
          37.</strong></p>
      <p>It is not possible for the heart in which Christ abides to be destitute of love. If we love God because He ﬁrst
          loved us, we shall love all for whom Christ died. We cannot come in touch with divinity without coming in
          touch with humanity; for in Him who sits upon the throne of the universe, divinity and humanity are combined.
          Connected with Christ, we are connected with our fellow men by the golden links of the chain of love. Then the
          pity and compassion of Christ will be manifest in our life. We shall not wait to have the needy and
          unfortunate brought to us. We shall not need to be entreated to feel for the woes of others. It will be as
          natural for us to minister to the needy and suffering as it was for Christ to go about doing good.</p>
      <p>Wherever there is an impulse of love and sympathy, wherever the heart reaches out to bless and uplift others,
          there is revealed the working of God’s Holy Spirit. In the depths of heathenism, men who have had no knowledge
          of the written law of God, who have never even heard the name of Christ, have been kind to His servants,
          protecting them at the risk of their own lives. Their acts show the working of a divine power. The Holy Spirit
          has implanted the grace of Christ in the heart of the savage, quickening his sympathies contrary to his
          nature, contrary to his education. The “Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world” (John 1:9),
          is shining in his soul; and this light, if heeded, will guide his feet to the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>The glory of heaven is in lifting up the fallen, comforting the distressed. And wherever Christ abides in human
          hearts, He will be revealed in the same way. Wherever it acts, the religion of Christ will bless. Wherever it
          works, there is brightness.</p>
      <p>No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is recognized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind.
