    <h1>Meditating on God’s Word</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. Psalm 119:97.</strong></p>
      <p>Men need not the dim light of tradition and custom to make the Scriptures comprehensible. It is just as
          sensible to suppose that the sun, shining in the heavens at noonday, needs the glimmerings of the torchlights
          of earth to increase its glory. In the Bible every duty is made plain, every lesson is comprehensible. The
          gift of Christ and the illumination of the Holy Spirit reveal to us the Father. The Word is able to make men
          and women and youth wise unto salvation.</p>
      <p>“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is proﬁtable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
          instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works” (2
          Timothy 3:16, 17). No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the
          broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God’s Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
          mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose that is rarely seen in these times.</p>
      <p>Little beneﬁt is to be derived from a hasty reading of the Scriptures. One may read the whole Bible through,
          and yet fail to see its beauty or to comprehend its depth of meaning. One passage studied until its
          signiﬁcance is clear to the mind, and its relation to the plan of salvation evident, is of more value than the
          perusal of many chapters with no deﬁnite purpose in view and no positive instruction gained. Keep your Bible
          with you. As you have opportunity, read it; ﬁx the texts in your memory. Even while you are walking in the
          street, you may read a passage and meditate upon it, thus ﬁxing it on the mind.</p>
      <p>Never should the Bible be studied without prayer. Before opening its pages, we should ask for the enlightenment
          of the Holy Spirit, and it will be given. When Nathanael came to Jesus, the Saviour exclaimed, “Behold an
          Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile” (John 1:47). Nathanael said, “Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered
          and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the ﬁg tree, I saw thee” (verse 48).
          And Jesus will see us also in the secret place of prayer, if we will seek Him for light, that we may know what
          is truth. Angels from the world of light will be with those who in humility of heart seek for divine
          <nobr>guidance.—Atlantic</nobr> Union Gleaner, June 9, 1909.</p>
