    <h1>A Prayer for the Outpouring of the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes
          I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctiﬁed through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but
          for them also which shall believe on me through their word. John <nobr>17:18-20.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>My heavenly Father, I come to Thee at this time, just as I am, poor and needy, and dependent upon Thee. I ask
          Thee to give me and give this people the grace that perfects Christian character. Wilt Thou have compassion
          upon this people? Let Thy light shine into the chambers of the mind, and into the soul temple. My Saviour,
          Thou hast given Thy life to purchase Thine inheritance, that, as overcomers, they may enter the kingdom of
          God, where they shall go no more out forever. Bless those who have signiﬁed their desire to serve Thee. Put
          Thy Spirit upon them.</p>
      <p>I ask Thee, heavenly Father, to let Thy Holy Spirit come to this people. May Thy salvation be revealed. Touch
          their hearts, and make them very tender. Soften them by Thy Holy Spirit, and help them to see the work to be
          done for their neighbors, and for souls that are perishing all around them. Oh, awaken them to their
          responsibilities! May they wash their robes of character, and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Wilt
          Thou encircle them in the arms of Thy mercy? Plead with them through the impressions of Thy Holy Spirit, that
          they may try to let their light shine to those that have not known the truth. Put Thy church in order, O Lord,
          that they may labor for souls.</p>
      <p>My Saviour, reveal Thyself to this people. Let Thy love be expressed. Oh, let it be revealed! Hold Thy people,
          that Satan may not have his will and way with them. Help them to press through all opposition, that at last
          they may lay their crowns at the feet of Jesus in the city of God; and Thy name shall have all the glory.
          <nobr>Amen.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, July 16, 1908.</p>
