    <h1>Gentleness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance: against such there is no law. Galatians 5:22, 23.</strong></p>
      <p>If we have Christ abiding with us, we shall be Christians at home as well as abroad. He who is a Christian will
          have kind words for his relatives and associates. He will be kind, courteous, loving, sympathetic, and will be
          educating himself for an abode with the family above. If he is a member of the royal family, he will represent
          the kingdom to which he is going. He will speak with gentleness to his children, for he will realize that
          they, too, are heirs of God, members of the heavenly court. Among the children of God no spirit of harshness
          dwells; for “the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
          meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” The spirit that is cherished in the home is the spirit
          that will be manifested in the church.</p>
      <p>Oh, we must educate the soul to be pitiful, gentle, tender, full of forgiveness and compassion. While we lay
          aside all vanity, all foolish talking, jesting, and joking, we are not to become cold, unsympathetic, and
          unsocial. The Spirit of the Lord is to rest upon you until you shall be like a fragrant ﬂower from the garden
          of God. You are to keep talking of the light, of Jesus, the Sun of righteousness, until you shall change from
          glory to glory, from character to character, going on from strength to strength, and reﬂecting more and more
          of the precious image of Jesus. When you do this, the Lord will write in the books of heaven, “Well done,”
          because you represent Jesus.</p>
      <p>Christians should not be <nobr>hard-hearted,</nobr> unapproachable; Jesus is to be reﬂected in our deportment,
          and we are to have a character beautiful with the graces of heaven. The presence of God is to be an abiding
          presence with us; and wherever we are, we are to carry light to the world. Those around you are to realize
          that the atmosphere of heaven surrounds <nobr>you.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, September 20, 1892.</p>
