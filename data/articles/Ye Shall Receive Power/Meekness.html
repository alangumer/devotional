    <h1>Meekness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love. Ephesians 4:2. I
          invite you to look to the Man of Calvary. Look to Him whose head was crowned with the crown of thorns, who
          bore the cross of shame, who went step by step down the path of humiliation. Look to Him who was a man of
          sorrows, and acquainted with grief, who was despised and rejected of men. “Surely he hath borne our griefs,
          and carried our sorrows” (Isaiah 53:4). “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
          iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed” (verse 5). Look to
          Calvary until your heart melts at the amazing love of the Son of God. He left nothing</strong></p>
      <p>undone that fallen man might be elevated and puriﬁed.</p>
      <p>And shall we not confess Him? Will the religion of Christ degrade its receiver? No; it will be no degradation
          to follow in the footsteps of the Man of Calvary. Day by day let us sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn of
          Him, that in our conversation, our conduct, our dress, and in all our affairs, we may reveal the fact that
          Jesus is ruling and reigning over us. God calls upon us to walk in a path that has been cast up for the
          ransomed of the Lord; we are not to walk in the world. We are to surrender all to God, and confess Christ
          before men.</p>
      <p>“Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 10:33).
          What right have we to profess to be Christians, and yet deny our Lord in life and deed? “He that taketh not
          his cross, and followeth after me is not worthy of me. He that ﬁndeth his life shall lose it: and he that
          loseth his life for my sake shall ﬁnd it” (verses 38, 39). Day by day we are to deny self, to lift the cross
          and follow in the footsteps of the Master.</p>
      <p>Oh, that the baptism of the Holy Spirit might come upon you, that you might be imbued with the Spirit of God!
          Then day by day you will become more and more conformed to the image of Christ, and in every action of your
          life, the question would be, “Will it glorify my Master?” By patient continuance in <nobr>well-doing</nobr>
          you would seek for glory and honor, and would receive the gift of <nobr>immortality.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, May 10, 1892.</p>
