      <p><strong>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore
          again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which
          the Father hath put in his own power. Acts 1:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>The disciples were anxious to know the exact time for the revelation of the kingdom of God; but Jesus tells
          them that they may not know the times and the seasons; for the Father has not revealed them. To understand
          when the kingdom of God should be restored was not the thing of most importance for them to know. They were to
          be found following the Master, praying, waiting, watching, and working. They were to be representatives to the
          world of the character of Christ.</p>
      <p>That which was essential for a successful Christian experience in the days of the disciples is essential in our
          day. “And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in
          his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.” And after the Holy
          Ghost was come upon them, what were they to do? “And ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in
          all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Acts 1:7, 8).</p>
      <p>This is the work in which we also are to be engaged. Instead of living in expectation of some special season of
          excitement, we are wisely to improve present opportunities, doing that which must be done in order that souls
          may be saved. Instead of exhausting the powers of our mind in speculations in regard to the times and seasons
          which the Lord has placed in His own power, and withheld from men, we are to yield ourselves to the control of
          the Holy Spirit, to do present duties, to give the bread of life, unadulterated with human opinions, to souls
          who are perishing for the truth.</p>
      <p>Satan is ever ready to ﬁll the mind with theories and calculations that will divert men from the present truth,
          and disqualify them for the giving of the third angel’s message to the <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, March 22, 1892.</p>
