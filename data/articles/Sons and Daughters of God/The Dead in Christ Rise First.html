    <h1>The Dead in Christ Rise First, December 18</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
          the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. <span class="ft36">1 Thessalonians
          4:16</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> will call up His purchased possession in the first resurrection, and until that
          triumphant hour, when the last trump shall sound and the vast army shall come forth to eternal victory, every
          sleeping saint will be kept in safety and will be guarded as a precious jewel, who is known to God by name. By
          the power of the Saviour that dwelt in them while living and because they were partakers of the divine nature,
          they are brought forth from the dead.<a href="#page_462"><span class="ft43">31</span></a></p>
      <p>“The hour is coming,” Christ said, “in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall
          come forth.” That voice is to resound through all the habitations of the dead; and every saint who sleeps in
          Jesus will awake and leave his <nobr>prison-house.</nobr> Then the virtue of character we received from
          Christ’s righteousness will ally us to true greatness of the highest order.<a href="#page_462"><span
          class="ft32">32</span></a></p>
      <p>The victory of the sleeping saints will be glorious on the morning of the resurrection.... The
          <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> will crown with immortality all</p>
      <p>who come forth from the grave.<a href="#page_462"><span class="ft35">33</span></a></p>
      <p>There stands the risen host. The last thought was of death and its pangs. The last thoughts they had were of
          the grave and the tomb, but now they proclaim, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”
          ... Here they stand and the finishing touch of immortality is put upon them and they go up to meet their Lord
          in the air.... There</p>
      <p>are the columns of angels on either side; ... then the angelic choir strike the note of victory and the angels
          in the two columns take up the song and the redeemed host join as though they had been singing the song on the
          earth, and they have been. Oh, what music! There is not an inharmonious note. Every voice proclaims, “Worthy
          is the Lamb that was slain.” He sees the travail of His soul, and is satisfied.<a href="#page_462"><span
