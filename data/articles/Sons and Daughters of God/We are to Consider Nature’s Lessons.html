    <h1>We are to Consider Nature’s Lessons, March 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
          neither do they spin.</strong></p>
      <p>Matthew 6:28<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Natural science is God’s storehouse from which every student in the school of Christ may draw. The ways of God
          in natural philosophy, and the mysteries connected with His dealings with man, are a treasury from which all
          may draw.<a href="#page_414"><span class="ft42">20</span></a></p>
      <p>The flowers of the field, in their endless variety, are always minis- tering to the delight of the children of
          men. God Himself nourishes every root, that He may express His love to all who will be softened and subdued by
          the works of His hands. We need no artificial display. God’s love is represented by the beautiful things of
          His creation.<a href="#page_414"><span class="ft54">21</span></a></p>
      <p>Christ sought to draw the attention of His disciples away from the artificial to the natural: “If God so clothe
          the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
          O ye of little faith!” Why did not our heavenly Father carpet the earth with brown or gray? He chose the color
          that was most restful, the most acceptable to the senses. How it cheers the heart and refreshes the weary
          spirit to look upon the earth, clad in its garments of living green! Without this covering the air would be
          filled with dust, and the earth would appear like a desert. Every spire of grass, every opening bud and
          blooming flower is a token of God’s love, and should teach us a lesson of faith and trust in Him. Christ calls
          our attention to their natural loveliness, and assures us that the most gorgeous array of the greatest king
          that ever wielded an earthly scepter was not equal to that worn by the humblest flower. You who are sighing
          for the artificial splendor which wealth alone can purchase, for costly paintings, furniture, and dress,
          listen to the voice of the divine Teacher. He points you to the flower of the field,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[76]</span><span class="ft34">the simple design of which cannot be equalled by human
          skill.</span><a href="#page_414"><span class="ft35">22</span></a></p>
