      <p>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not</p>
      <p>having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be</p>
      <p>holy and without blemish. <span class="ft44">Ephesians 5:27</span>.</p>
      <p>The church, enfeebled and defective though it be, is the only object on earth on which Christ bestows His
          supreme regard. He is constantly watching it with solicitude, and is strengthening it by His Holy Spirit. Will
          we, as members of His church, allow Him to impress our minds and to work through us to His glory?<a

      <p>Christ loves His church. He will give all needed help to those who call upon Him for strength for the
          development of Christlike character. But His love is not weakness. He will not serve with their sins or give
          them prosperity while they continue to follow a wrong course of action. Only by faithful repentance will their
          sins be forgiven; for God will not cover evil with the robe of His righteousness. He will honor faithful
          service. He will abundantly bless those who reveal to their fellowmen His justice, mercy, and love. Let those
          who are engaged in His service walk before Him in true humility, following faithfully in His footsteps,
          cherishing the holy principles which will live through the eternal ages. Let them in word and action show that
          they obey the laws which are obeyed in heaven.<a href="#page_402"><span class="ft43">24</span></a></p>
      <p>The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will eventually be
          made manifest, even to “the principalities and powers in heavenly places,” the final and full display of the
          love of God.... The church is God’s fortress, His city of</p>
      <p>refuge, which He holds in a revolted world.... It is the theater of His</p>
      <p>grace, in which He delights to reveal His power to transform hearts.<a href="#page_402"><span
          class="ft48">25</span></a>God’s love for His church is infinite. His care over His heritage is</p>
