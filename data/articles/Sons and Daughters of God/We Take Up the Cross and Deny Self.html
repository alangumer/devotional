    <h1>We Take Up the Cross and Deny Self, August 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which
          I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. <span
          class="ft36">Galatians 2:20</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ was crucified for fallen man. But to many who call them- selves Christians this event is nothing. In
          practise they deny the cross of Christ.... They admit that Christ died on the cross, but because</p>
      <p>there is a crucifixion for them to experience, they will not receive the lessons that lead to
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacrifice.</nobr> They are Christians in name only. The central point
          of their faith is not a crucified and risen Saviour, who brings to all that receive Him the privilege of being
          sons and daughters of God.<a href="#page_444"><span class="ft42">59</span></a></p>
      <p>Give up the pleasures of sin in exchange for heaven and eternal life. What are the few days of selfish
          gratification that contain not one genuine drop of happiness, to the eternity of bliss that awaits the
          faithful soul? Keep not Christ’s love from your soul. Look to the cross of Calvary if you want a tangible
          proof of His love. Heaven is looking upon you with intense interest, to see what you will do. The angels are
          amazed when you turn with indifference from the blessings that are proffered you. If you refuse to respond to
          the drawing love of Christ, you will finally grow rebellious and defiant.<a href="#page_444"><span

      <p>Paul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but in the presence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious
          influence filled his heart, bringing every thought into subjection to Christ.... In the apostle’s</p>
      <p>teachings, Christ was the central figure. “I live,” he declared, “yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.” Self was
          hidden; Christ was revealed and exalted.<a href="#page_444"><span class="ft41">61</span></a></p>
      <p>Those who deny self to do others good, and who devote them- selves and all they have to Christ’s service, will
          realize the happiness</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[247]</span><span class="ft34">which the selfish man seeks for in vain.</span><a
