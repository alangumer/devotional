    <h1>The Courageous Among God’s Jewels, July 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare
          them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. <span class="ft36">Malachi 3:17</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Great is the work of the Lord. Men are choosing sides. Even those supposed to be heathen will choose the side
          of Christ, while those who become offended, as did the disciples, will go away and walk no more with
          Him....</p>
      <p>What effect will the attempt of men to make void the law of God have upon the righteous? Will they be
          intimidated because of the universal scorn that is put upon the holy law of God? Will the true believers in
          the, “Thus saith the Lord,” become wavering and ashamed because the whole world seems to despise His righteous
          law? Will they be carried away by the prevalence of <nobr>evil?—No;</nobr> to those who have consecrated
          themselves to God to serve Him, the law of God becomes more precious when the contrast is shown between the
          obedient and the transgressor. In proportion as the attributes of Satan are developed in the despisers and
          transgressors of the law of God, to the faithful adherent the holy precept will become more dear and valuable.
          He will declare, “They have made void thy law. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
          gold.” It is the ones who have been faithful stewards of the grace of God whose love of God’s commandments
          grows with the contempt which all around them would put upon them.</p>
      <p>Wicked men and the church harmonize in this hatred of the law of God, and then the crisis comes.... But while
          they are murmuring</p>
      <p>and complaining, and falsely accusing, and doing Satan’s work most zealously, another class is brought to our
          notice: “Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and
          a book of remembrance was written before him for</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[218]</span><span class="ft34">them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his
          name.”</span><a href="#page_440"><span class="ft35">70</span></a></p>
