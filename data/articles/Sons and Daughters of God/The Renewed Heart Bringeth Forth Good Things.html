    <h1>The Renewed Heart Bringeth Forth Good Things,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>April 5</strong></p>
      <p>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth</p>
      <p>good things. <span class="ft44">Matthew 12:35</span>.</p>
      <p>True sanctification unites believers to Christ and to one another in bonds of tender sympathy. This union
          causes to flow continually into the heart rich currents of Christlike love, which flows forth again in love
          for one another.</p>
      <p>The qualities which it is essential for all to possess are those which marked the completeness of Christ’s
          <nobr>character,—His</nobr> love, His patience, His unselfishness, and His goodness. These attributes are
          gained by doing kindly actions with a kindly heart.... Christians love</p>
      <p>those around them as precious souls for whom Christ has died. There is no such thing as a loveless Christian;
          for “God is love.” ... “This is my commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you.” This is the
          fruit that is to be given back to God.<a href="#page_418"><span class="ft33">12</span></a></p>
      <p>The Lord will help every one of us where we need help the most in the grand work of overcoming and conquering
          self. Let the law of kindness be upon your lips and the oil of grace in your heart. This will produce
          wonderful results. You will be tender, sympathetic, courteous. You need all these graces. The Holy Spirit must
          be received and brought into your character; then it will be as holy fire, giving forth incense which will
          rise up to God, not from lips that condemn, but as a healer of the souls of men. Your countenance will express
          the image of the divine.... God requires every soul in His service to kindle</p>
      <p>their censers from the coals of sacred fire. The common, severe, harsh words that come from your lips so
          readily must be withheld, and the Spirit of God speak through the human agent. By beholding the character of
          Christ you will become changed into His likeness. The grace of Christ alone can changed your heart and then
          you will reflect the image of the Lord Jesus. God calls upon us to be like <nobr>Him,—pure,</nobr></p>
