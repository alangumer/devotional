      <p><strong>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by
          the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
          high. <span class="ft36">Hebrews 1:3</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Who is <nobr>Christ?—He</nobr> is the only begotten Son of the living God. He is to the Father as a word that
          expresses the <nobr>thought,—as</nobr> a thought made audible. Christ is the word of God. Christ said to
          Philip, “He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father.” His words were the echo of God’s words. Christ was the
          likeness of God, the brightness of His glory, the express image of His person.<a href="#page_403"><span

      <p>As a personal being, God has revealed Himself in His Son. Jesus, the outshining of the Father’s glory, “and the
          express image of his person” (<span class="ft51">Hebrews 1:3</span>), was on earth found in fashion as a man.
          As a personal Saviour He came to the world. As a personal Saviour He ascended on high. As a personal Saviour
          He intercedes in the heavenly courts. Before the throne of God in our behalf ministers “One like unto the Son
          of man.” <span class="ft51">Revelation 1:13</span>.</p>
      <p>Christ, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of His divinity and came to live as a man among
          men, that they might, without being consumed, become acquainted with their Creator....</p>
      <p>Christ came to teach human beings what God desires them to know. In the heavens above, in the earth, in the
          broad waters of the ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify to His power, His wisdom,
          His love. But not from the stars or the ocean or the cataract can we learn of the personality of God as it is
          revealed in Christ.<a href="#page_404"><span class="ft42">47</span></a></p>
      <p>Tender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others, He represented the character of God, and was
          constantly engaged in service for God and man.... As Jesus was in human nature, so God</p>
      <p>means His followers to be. In His strength we are to live the life of</p>
