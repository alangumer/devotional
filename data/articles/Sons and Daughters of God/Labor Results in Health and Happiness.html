    <h1>Labor Results in Health and Happiness, June 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore
          thou shalt surely rejoice.</strong></p>
      <p>Deuteronomy 16:15<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>A faithful fulfillment of home duties, filling the position you can occupy to the best advantage, be it ever so
          simple and humble, is truly elevating. This divine influence is needed. In this there is peace and sacred joy.
          It possesses healing power. It will secretly and insensibly soothe the wounds of the soul, and even the
          sufferings of the body. Peace of mind, which comes from pure and holy motives and actions, will give free and
          vigorous spring to all the organs of the body. Inward peace and a conscience void of offense toward God, will
          quicken and invigorate the intellect, like dew distilled upon the tender plants. The will is then rightly
          directed and controlled, and is more decided and yet free from perverseness. The meditations are pleasing
          because they are sanctified. The serenity of mind which you may possess, will bless all with whom you
          associate.... The more you taste this</p>
      <p>heavenly peace and quietude of mind, the more it will increase. It is an animated, living pleasure which does
          not throw all the moral energies into a stupor, but awakens them to increased activity. Perfect peace is an
          attribute of Heaven which angels possess.<a href="#page_431"><span class="ft32">32</span></a></p>
      <p>Never will children and youth feel the peace of contentment until by the faithful performance of home duties
          they relieve the tired hands and weary heart and brain of the mother.... Those who neglect to bear</p>
      <p>part of the responsibilities of the home are the ones who are troubled with loneliness and discontent; for they
          have not learned the truth that those who are happy are happy because they share the daily routine of work.<a

      <p><nobr>Well-directed</nobr> labor is just what they require to make them strong, vigorous, cheerful, happy, and
          courageous to meet the various trials</p>
