      <p><strong>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
          unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. <span class="ft36">Ephesians
          4:13</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>As you make advances in the Christian life, you will be con- stantly growing up into the measure of the stature
          of the fullness of Christ. In your experience, you will be proving what is the length and breadth, the depth
          and height, of the love of God, which passeth knowledge. You will feel your unworthiness. You will have no
          dispo- sition to claim perfection of character, but only to exalt the perfection of your Redeemer. The more
          thorough and rich your experience in the knowledge of Jesus, the more humble will be your views of

          blessing wherever you go. Whether you have one, two, or five talents, all will be devoted to the service of
          Him who has committed them to you in trust....</p>
      <p>God does not intend that your light shall so shine that your good words or works shall bring the praise of men
          to yourself; but that the Author of all good shall be glorified and exalted. Jesus, in His life, gave to men a
          model of character. How little power did the world have over Him to mold Him according to its standard! All
          its influence was thrown off.<a href="#page_458"><span class="ft42">49</span></a></p>
      <p>You cannot stand still; you must either advance or retrograde....</p>
      <p>Where there is spiritual health there is growth. The child of God grows up to the full stature of a man or
