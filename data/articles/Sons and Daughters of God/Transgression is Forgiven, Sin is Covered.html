    <h1>Transgression is Forgiven, Sin is Covered, October 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is</strong></p>
      <p>covered. <span class="ft44">Psalm 32:1</span>.</p>
      <p>That God who marks the fall of a sparrow, marks your deportment and your feelings; He marks your envy, your
          prejudice, your attempt to justify your action in the least matter of injustice. When you misconceive the
          words and acts of another, and your own feelings are stirred, so that you make incorrect statements, and it is
          known that you are at variance with your brother, you lead others, through their confidence in you, to regard
          him just as you do; and by the root of bitterness springing up, many are defiled. When it is evident that your
          feelings are incorrect, do you try just as diligently to remove the erroneous impressions as you did to make
          them? ...</p>
      <p>Now God requires that you who have thus done the least injustice to another shall confess your fault, not only
          to the one you have injured, but to those who through your influence have been led to regard their brother in
          a false light, and to make of none effect the work God has given him to do.... By repentance and confession
          you</p>
      <p>can have pardon registered against your name; or you can resist the conviction of the Spirit of God, and during
          the rest of your life, work to make it appear that your wrong feelings and unjust conclusions could not be
          helped. But there stands the action, there stands the evil committed, there stands the ruin of those in whose
          hearts you planted the root of bitterness....</p>
      <p>Whatever the character of your sin, confess it. If it is against God only, confess only to Him. If you have
          wronged or offended others, confess also to them, and the blessing of the Lord will rest upon you. In this way
          you die to self, and Christ is formed within....</p>
      <p>Our consecration to God must be unreserved, our love ardent, our faith unwavering. Then the expressions of the
          lips will testify to the quickened intelligence of the mind and the deep movings of the Spirit</p>
