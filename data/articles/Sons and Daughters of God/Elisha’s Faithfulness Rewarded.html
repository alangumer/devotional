    <h1>Elisha’s Faithfulness Rewarded, March 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen
          before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. <span
          class="ft36">1 Kings 19:19</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The prophet Elijah was about to close his earthly labors. Another was to be called to carry forward the work
          for that time. In his course of travel, Elijah was directed northward.... Wherever Elijah looked,</p>
      <p>the land he saw was owned by one <nobr>man,—a</nobr> man who had not bowed the knee to Baal, whose heart had
          remained undivided in the service of God.... The owner of the land was Shaphat....</p>
      <p>The attention of Elijah was attracted to Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who with the servants was plowing with
          twelve yoke of oxen. He was educator, director, and worker. Elisha did not live in the thickly populated
          cities. His father was a tiller of the soil, a farmer. Far from city and court dissipation, Elisha had
          received his education. He had been trained in habits of simplicity, of obedience to his parents and to
          God.... But though of a meek and quiet spirit, Elisha had no</p>
      <p>changeable character. Integrity and fidelity and the love and fear of God were his. He had the characteristics
          of a ruler, but with it all was the meekness of one who would serve. His mind had been exercised in the little
          things, to be faithful in whatsoever he should do; so that if God should call him to act more directly for
          Him, he would be prepared to hear His voice.</p>
      <p>The surroundings of Elisha’s home were those of wealth; but he realized that in order to obtain an
          <nobr>all-round</nobr> education, he must be a constant worker in any work that needed to be done. He had not
          consented to be in any respect less informed than his father’s servants. He had learned how to serve first,
          that he might know how to lead, instruct, and command.<a href="#page_417"><span

      <p>Elisha stood in Elijah’s place. And he who had been faithful in</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[94]</span><span class="ft34">that which was least, proved himself faithful also in
          much.</span><a href="#page_417"><span class="ft35">72</span></a></p>
