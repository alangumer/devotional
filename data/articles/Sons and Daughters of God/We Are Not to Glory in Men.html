    <h1>We Are Not to Glory in Men, August 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore let no man glory in men. <span
          class="ft45">1 Corinthians 3:20, 21</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>We are living in an age of licentiousness, and men and youth are bold in sin. Unless our youth are sacredly
          guarded, unless they are fortified with firm principles, unless greater care is manifested in choosing their
          associates and the literature which feeds the mind, they will be exposed to a society whose morals are as
          corrupt as were the morals of the inhabitants of Sodom.... Our youth will meet</p>
      <p>temptations on every hand, and they must be so educated that they will depend upon higher power, higher
          teaching, than can be given by mortals. There are despisers of our Lord everywhere, who habitually throw
          contempt upon Christianity.... Those who have not moral power</p>
      <p>cannot stand in defense of the truth; they have not courage to say: “Unless such conversation ceases, I cannot
          remain in your presence. Jesus, the world’s Redeemer is my Saviour; in Him is centered my hope of eternal
          life.” But this is the very way in which to silence them. If you argue with them, they will have arguments
          with which to meet you, and nothing you may say will touch them; but if you live for Christ, if you are firm
          in your allegiance to the God of heaven, you may do for them that which argument will fail to do....</p>
      <p>There is no sadder spectacle than that of those who have been purchased by the blood of Christ, who have been
          intrusted with tal- ents wherewith they may glorify God, turning to jest the messages graciously sent to them
          in the gospel, denying the divinity of Christ, and trusting to their own finite reasoning, and to arguments
          that have no foundation. When tested with affliction, when brought face to face with death, all these
          fallacies they have cherished will be melted away like frost before the sun.... The Christian hope is as an
          anchor to the</p>
