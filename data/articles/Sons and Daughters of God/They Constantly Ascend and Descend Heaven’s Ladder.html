      <p><strong>Ladder, January 31</strong></p>
      <p>And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the
          angels of God ascending and descending on it. <span class="ft36">Genesis 28:12</span>.</p>
      <p>In this speck of a world, the heavenly universe manifests the greatest interest.... Yet we come in contact with
          the busy activity of</p>
      <p>our cities, we mingle with the multitude in the crowded thoroughfares, we enter marts of trade and walk the
          streets; and through all, from morning till evening, the people act as if business, sport, and pleasure were
          all there is to <nobr>life,—as</nobr> if this world were all there is to occupy the mind. How few contemplate

          or when we think ourselves alone....</p>
      <p>These heavenly beings are ministering angels, and they frequently disguise themselves in the form of human
          beings, and as strangers converse with those who are engaged in the work of God. In lonely places they have
          been the companions of the traveler in peril. In <nobr>tempest-tossed</nobr> ships they have spoken words to
          allay fear and inspire hope in the hour of danger. Many, under different circumstances, have listened to the
          voices of the inhabitants of other worlds. Time and again have they been the leaders of armies. They have been
          sent forth to cleanse away pestilence. They have eaten at the humble board of families, and often have they
          appeared as weary travelers in need of shelter for the night....</p>
      <p>Heavenly angels are <nobr>co-operating</nobr> with us in every good work, and</p>
