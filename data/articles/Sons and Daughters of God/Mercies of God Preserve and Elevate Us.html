    <h1>Mercies of God Preserve and Elevate Us, November 6</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually
          preserve me. <span class="ft36">Psalm 40:11</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The religion of Christ will uplift the life to an elevated standard. The inward work of the Spirit of God
          humbles human pride, by causing us to understand something of the tender mercies and lov- ingkindness of
          God.... When you discover your own inefficiency, and</p>
      <p>look to the source of your strength, with yearning entreaty, saying, “Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from
          me, O Lord: let thy lov- ingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me,” you will obtain light....</p>
      <p>You cannot have faith that the Lord will keep you by His lov- ingkindness, and by His truth continually
          preserve you, when you do not place yourselves in the channel of light. Then shun bad com- panions, and choose
          the good. The seed of truth sown in the heart must receive the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness in
          order to grow. The seeds of truth which do not spring up and grow, soon lose their power to germinate, and
          they perish. But weeds of evil habits will spring up and flourish. The precious plants of love, joy, patience,
          courtesy, meekness, and humility, need to be carefully cultivated if they grow and improve.</p>
      <p>Do not be content with a superficial piety, but, young friends, grow in grace and the knowledge of Jesus
          Christ. Are you making advancement? Is the plant of grace waxing into a tree, or withering away? Present
          yourselves humbly and often at the throne of grace, and tell Jesus your every want, and do not think anything
          is too small for Him to notice. The Lord loves to have you seek Him, and tell Him your trials, as a child
          would talk with his parent. When you pray, believe Jesus hears you, and will do the things you ask of Him.
          Show that you have perfect trust in Jesus, and ever seek to do those things</p>
      <p>that you know will please Him, and you will have peace in Christ.<a href="#page_456"><span
