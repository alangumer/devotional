      <p>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of</p>
      <p>all thine increase. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 3:9</span>.</p>
      <p>Are you not chosen of God to be a vessel unto honor, to convey light and truth to those who are in error and
          darkness? The saving message of truth has come to you, and if you receive of the spirit of Christ, you will
          have a love for the souls who are in peril.<a href="#page_449"><span class="ft32">58</span></a></p>
      <p>Men will compass land and sea for earthly gain, and endure pri- vation and suffering to obtain their object,
          yet will turn away from heavenâ€™s attractions, and not regard eternal riches. Men who are in comparative
          poverty are usually the ones who do the most to sustain the cause of God. They are generous with their little.
          They have strengthened their generous impulses by continual liberalities. When their expenditures pressed
          close upon the income, their passion for earthly riches had no room or chance to strengthen. But many, when
          they begin to gather earthly riches, commence to calculate how long it will be before they can be in
          possession of a certain sum. In their anx- iety to amass wealth for themselves, they fail to become rich
          toward God.<a href="#page_449"><span class="ft33">59</span></a></p>
      <p>It should be your object, in whatever vocation you may be found, to do your work in a manner that shall glorify
          God. All that you gain, you should look upon as capital to be invested in the bank of heaven. It should be
          your joy to devote means, and time, and ability to win souls for Christ, to send the light to those who sit in
          darkness.<a href="#page_449"><span class="ft32">60</span></a></p>
      <p>The Lord has ordained that the diffusion of light and truth in the earth shall be dependent upon the efforts
          and offerings of those who are partakers of the heavenly gift. He might have made angels the ambassadors of
          His truth; He might have made known His will, as He proclaimed the law from Sinai, with His own voice; but in
          His infinite love and wisdom He called men to become <nobr>co-laborers</nobr> with</p>
