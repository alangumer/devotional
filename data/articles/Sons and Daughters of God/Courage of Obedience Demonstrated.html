    <h1>Courage of Obedience Demonstrated, July 17</h1>

      <p><strong>And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that
          thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. <span class="ft36">Genesis
          22:12</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Abraham, ... in obedience to the divine command, ... pursues his journey with Isaac by his side. He sees before
          him the mountain which God had told him He would signalize as the one upon which he was to sacrifice. He
          removes the wood from the shoulder of his servant and lays it upon Isaac, the one to be offered. He girds up
          his soul with firmness and agonizing sternness, ready for the work which God requires him to do. With a
          breaking heart and unnerved hand, he takes the fire, while Isaac inquires: Father, here is the fire and the
          wood; but where is the offering? But, oh, Abraham cannot tell him now! Father and son build the altar, and the
          terrible moment comes for Abraham to make known to Isaac that which had agonized his soul all that long
          journey, that Isaac himself is the victim. Isaac is not a lad; he is a <nobr>full-grown</nobr> young man. He
          could have refused to submit to his fatherâ€™s design had he chosen to do so. He does not accuse his father of
          insanity, nor does he even seek to change his purpose. He submits. He believes in the love of his father and
          that he would not make this terrible sacrifice of his only son if God had not bidden him to do so.</p>
      <p>Isaac is bound by the trembling, loving hands of his pitying father because God has said it. The son submits to
          the sacrifice because he believes in the integrity of his father. But when everything is ready, when the faith
          of the father and the submission of the son are fully tested, the angel of God stays the uplifted hand of
          Abraham that is about to slay his son and tells him that it is enough.<a href="#page_437"><span

      <p>In order to obey God willingly under all circumstances, great courage is needful.<a href="#page_437"><span
