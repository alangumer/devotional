      <p>Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand,
          then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. <span

      <p>Abraham’s household comprised more than a thousand souls. Those who were led by his teachings to worship the
          true God found a home in his encampment; and here, as in a school, they received such instruction as would
          prepare them to be representatives of the faith. Abraham’s affection for his children and his household led
          him to guard their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of the divine statutes, as the most precious
          legacy he could transmit to them, and through them to the world. All were taught that they were under the rule
          of the God of heaven. There was to be no oppression on the part of parents, and no disobedience on the part of
          children. God’s law had appointed to each his duties, and only in obedience could any secure happiness and
          prosperity.</p>
      <p>His own example, the silent influence of his daily life, was a con- stant lesson. The unswerving integrity, the
          benevolence and unselfish courtesy which had won the admiration of kings, were displayed in the home. There
          was a fragrance about the life, a nobility and loveliness of character, which revealed to all that he was
          connected with heaven. He did not neglect the soul of the humblest servant. In his household there was not one
          law for the master, and one for the servant; a royal way for the rich, and another for the poor. All were
          treated with justice and compassion.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft33">23</span></a></p>
      <p>He was a man of faith, who always followed principles of the strictest integrity. In all his business
          transactions he was courteous and honorable. His life was controlled by Christian politeness, and he placed
          the service of the Lord before all else. He would not swerve a hair’s breadth from pure, Christian
          principles.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft33">24</span></a></p>
      <p>It is in the power of every one to practise true Christlike courtesy.<a href="#page_456"><span
