    <h1>The Renewed Heart Loves as Christ Loved, April 4</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one
          another. <span class="ft45">John 13:34</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus says, “Love one another as I have loved you.” Love is not simply an impulse, a transitory emotion,
          dependent upon circum- stances; it is a living principle, a permanent power. The soul is fed by the streams of
          pure love that flow from the heart of Christ, as a <nobr>well-spring</nobr> that never fails. O, how is the
          heart quickened, how are its motives ennobled, its affections deepened, by this communion! Under the education
          and discipline of the Holy Spirit, the children of God love one another, truly, sincerely,
          <nobr>unaffectedly,—“without</nobr> partiality, and without hypocrisy.” And this because the heart is in love
          with Jesus. Our affection for one another springs from our common rela- tion to God. We are one family, we
          love one another as He loved us. When compared with this true, sanctified, disciplined affection, the shallow
          courtesy of the world, the meaningless expression of effusive friendship, are as chaff to the wheat.<a

      <p>To love as Christ loved means to manifest unselfishness at all times and in all places, by kind words and
          pleasant looks.... Genuine</p>
      <p>love is a precious attribute of heavenly origin, which increases its fragrance in proportion as it is dispensed
          to others....</p>
      <p>Christ’s love is deep and earnest, flowing like an irrepressible stream to all who will accept it. There is no
          selfishness in His love. If this <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> love is an abiding principle in the heart, it will
          make itself known, not only to those we hold most dear in sacred relationship, but to all with whom we come in
          contact. It will lead us to bestow little acts of attention, to make concessions, to perform deeds of
          kindness, to speak tender, true, encouraging words. It will</p>
      <p>lead us to sympathize with those whose hearts hunger for sympathy.<a href="#page_418"><span
