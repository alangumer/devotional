      <p>Christ longed to fill the world with a peace and joy that would be a similitude of that found in the heavenly
          world.... From His divine</p>
      <p>lips there fell with fullness and abundant assurance the benedictions that showed Him to be the fountain of all
          goodness, and that it was His prerogative to bless and impress the minds of all present. He was engaged in His
          peculiar, sacred province, and the treasures of eternity were at His command. In the disposal of them He knew
          no control. It was no robbery with Him to act in the office of God. In His blessings He embraced those who
          were to compose His kingdom in this world. He had brought into the world every blessing essential to the
          happiness and joy of every soul, and before that vast assembly He presented the riches of the grace of heaven,

          choice of subjects, and assigns them their place in His service as united with Himself. Those who possess the

          Him.<a href="#page_453"><span class="ft54">45</span></a></p>
      <p>He who feels whole, who thinks that he is reasonably good, and is contented with his condition, does not seek
          to become a partaker of the grace and righteousness of Christ. Pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart
          against Christ and the infinite blessings He came to give. There is no room for Jesus in the heart of such a
          person....</p>
      <p>Those who know that they cannot possibly save themselves, or of themselves do any righteous action, are the
          ones who appreciate the help that Christ can bestow. They are the poor in spirit, whom He</p>
