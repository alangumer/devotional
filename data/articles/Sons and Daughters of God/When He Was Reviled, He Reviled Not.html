    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, be threatened not; but committed himself
          to him that judgeth righteously. <span class="ft36">1 Peter 2:23</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>How often we feel that we have been dealt with unjustly, that things have been said concerning us that were
          untrue, and that we have been set in a false light before others. When we are thus tried, we shall need to
          keep strict guard over our spirit and our words. We shall need to have the love of Christ, that we may not
          cherish an unforgiving spirit. Let us not think that unless those who have injured us confess their wrongs, we
          are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. We should not accumulate our grievances, holding them
          to our hearts until the one we think guilty has humbled his heart by repentance and confession.... However
          sorely they may have</p>
      <p>wounded us, we are not to cherish our grievances and sympathize with ourselves over our injuries, but as we
          hope to be pardoned for our offenses against God, so must we pardon those who have done evil to us.... When we
          are reviled, how strong is the temptation to</p>
      <p>revile in return, but in doing this we show ourselves as bad as the reviler. When tempted to revile, send up a
          silent prayer that God will give you His grace, and keep the tongue in silence....</p>
      <p>Jesus has given us an example that we should follow in His steps, and manifest compassion and love and
          <nobr>good-will</nobr> toward all. Let us cultivate a kind spirit, a spirit of forbearance, and tender,
          pitying love toward those, who, when under temptation, have done us grievous wrongs. If possible, let us heal
          these wounds, and close the door of temptation by removing every barrier the wrongdoer has erected between
          himself and us.... The Lord delights to bestow His blessings</p>
      <p>upon those who will honor Him, who will acknowledge His mercy, and show that they appreciate His love to them
          by manifesting the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[145]</span><span class="ft34">same gracious characteristic to those around them.</span><a
