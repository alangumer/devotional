    <h1>God Promises Us a New Heart of Flesh, April 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the
          stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <span class="ft36">Ezekiel
          36:26</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The youth especially stumble over this phrase, “A new heart.” They do not know what it means. They look for a
          special change to take place in their feelings. This they term conversion. Over this error thousands have
          stumbled to ruin, not understanding the expression, “Ye must be born again.” ... When Jesus speaks of the new
          heart, He means the mind, the life, the whole being. To have a change of heart is to withdraw the affections
          from the world, and fasten them upon Christ. To have a new heart is to have a new mind, new purposes, new
          motives. What is the sign of a new <nobr>heart?—a</nobr> changed life. There is a daily, hourly dying to
          selfishness and pride.<a href="#page_418"><span class="ft43">7</span></a></p>
      <p>Then a spirit of kindness will be manifested, not by fits and starts, but continually. There will be a decided
          change in attitude, in deport- ment, in words and actions toward all with whom you are in any way connected.
          You will not magnify their infirmities, you will not place them in an unfavorable light. You will work in
          Christ’s lines....</p>
      <p>Instead of exposing and publishing one’s faults to others, you will put forth the most patient efforts to heal
          and bind up.... A harsh-</p>
      <p>spirited man is unrefined, coarse; he is not spiritual; he has not a heart of flesh, but a heart as
          unimpressible as a stone. His only help is to fall on the Rock, and be broken. The Lord will place all such in
          the crucible, and try them in fire, as gold is tried. When He can see His own image reflected in them He will
          remove them.... The religion</p>
      <p>of Christ is to take possession of the whole being, and give force and power to all our faculties, renovating,
          cleansing, and refining. It manifests itself without parade, and <nobr>high-sounding</nobr> words, but is
          shown in an upright and unselfish life.<a href="#page_418"><span class="ft42">8</span></a></p>
