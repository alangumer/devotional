      <p><strong>January 3</strong></p>
      <p>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he
          shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. <span class="ft30">1 John 3:2</span>.</p>
      <p>We are not to settle down, expecting that a change of character will come to us by some miraculous work, when
          Jesus shall appear in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. No, my young friends, we are
          <nobr>judgment-bound,</nobr> and probation is granted to us here in this life, in order that we may form
          characters for the future, immortal life.<a href="#page_401"><span class="ft41">6</span></a></p>
      <p>Let none imagine that selfishness, <nobr>self-esteem,</nobr> and <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> are compatible
          with the Spirit of Christ. Upon every truly converted man or woman there rests a responsibility that we cannot
          rightly estimate. The maxims and ways of the world are not to be adopted by the sons and daughters of the
          heavenly King.<a href="#page_401"><span class="ft33">7</span></a></p>
      <p>In separating from the world, we shall encounter difficulties on every hand. But here is comfort for us:
          “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he
          shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.”<a href="#page_401"><span
          class="ft42">8</span></a></p>
      <p>We should show by our words and works that we recognize the great responsibility laid upon us. Our light should
          shine so clearly that others can see that we glorify the Father in our daily lives; that we are connected with
          heaven and are joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<a href="#page_401"><span class="ft43">9</span></a>To have
          fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is to be ennobled and elevated, and made a partaker of
          joys unspeakable</p>
      <p>and full of glory. Food, clothing, station, and wealth may have their value; but to have a connection with God
          ... is of priceless value....</p>
      <p>And although it “doth not yet appear what we shall be,” “when Christ,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[10]</span><span class="ft34">who is our life, shall appear,” “we shall be like
          him.”</span><a href="#page_401"><span class="ft35">10</span></a></p>
