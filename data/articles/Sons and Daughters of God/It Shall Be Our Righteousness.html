    <h1>It Shall Be Our Righteousness, February 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these</strong></p>
      <p>commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath</p>
      <p><span class="ft11">commanded us.</span>Deuteronomy 6:25<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>The happiness of man is found in obedience to the laws of God. In obedience to God’s law he is surrounded as
          with a hedge and kept from the evil.<a href="#page_412"><span class="ft41">87</span></a></p>
      <p>The tempter’s voice will be heard on every side, telling you that you are not now required to keep the law of
          God. This is a device of Satan. God has a law, and men must keep it. If they disregard these rules, they will
          not have that perfection of character ... required to become members of the royal family ... for God wrote
          these ten holy rules on tables of stone and kept them in the ark of God’s testimony. The cover of this ark ...
          was called the <nobr>mercy-seat,</nobr> to signify that although death was the penalty for transgressing the
          law, mercy came through Jesus Christ to pardon the repentant, believing sinner.</p>
      <p>The only hope of any man lies through Jesus Christ, who brought the robe of His righteousness to put upon the
          sinner who would lay off his filthy garments.... The pure and holy garments are not prepared to</p>
      <p>be put on by any one after he has entered the gate of the city. All who enter will have on the robe of Christ’s
          righteousness.... There will be</p>
      <p>no covering up of sins and faults to hide the deformity of character; no robes will be half washed; but all
          will be pure and spotless.<a href="#page_412"><span class="ft33">88</span></a></p>
      <p>When we bring our lives to complete obedience to the law of God, regarding God as our supreme Guide, the
          clinging to Christ as our hope of righteousness, God will work in our behalf. This is a righteousness of
          faith.... The commandments of God diligently</p>
      <p>studied and practiced, open to us communication with heaven, and distinguish for us the true from the false.
          This obedience works out for us the divine will, bringing into our lives the righteousness and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[67]</span><span class="ft34">perfection that was seen in the life of Christ.</span><a
