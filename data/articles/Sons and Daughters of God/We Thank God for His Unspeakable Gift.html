    <h1>We Thank God for His Unspeakable Gift, August 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. <span class="ft44">2 Corinthians</span></strong></p>
      <p>9:15<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>What a terrible record the human race will have to meet in the last day, since the vast majority of men have
          refused the priceless <nobr>offering,—rejected</nobr> the richest gift that God could bestow upon the world.
          It is through the inestimable gift of Christ that all our blessings come. Life, health, friends, reason,
          happiness, are ours through the merit of Christ. O that the young and the old might realize that all comes to
          them through the virtue of Christ’s life and death, and acknowledge the ownership of God.</p>
      <p>The apostle writes, “Ye are not your own.” Even when we were under the control of a cruel master, even when the
          prince of darkness ruled our spirits, the Lord Jesus Christ paid the ransom price of His own blood for us....
          Render to Him willing heart service, and no</p>
      <p>longer rob God of that which is His own. “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
          through Jesus Christ our Lord.” ...</p>
      <p>Through His holy Word, through His providences, and through messages sent to you by His servants, Jesus is
          daily saying to you, “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I
          will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” Jesus has given His precious life for you, that
          you may become a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
          lust. Then give yourself to Him as a pledge of grateful love. Were it not for the love freely given us of
          Christ, we should now be in hopeless despair, in spiritual midnight. Thank God every day that He gave us
          Jesus.<a href="#page_443"><span class="ft33">38</span></a></p>
      <p>The thought that Christ died to obtain for us the gift of everlasting life, is enough to call forth from our
          hearts the most sincere and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[239]</span><span class="ft34">fervent gratitude, and from our lips the most enthusiastic
          praise.</span><a href="#page_443"><span class="ft35">39</span></a></p>
