    <h1>Faithfulness in Little Things, September 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least
          is unjust also in much. <span class="ft36">Luke 16:10</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Much time is lost in longing to do some great thing, some won- derful work, while the duties lying close at
          hand, the performance of which would make the life fragrant, are lost sight of. The life that is Christlike in
          the home will be Christlike in the church. It is the neglect of the smaller duties in an effort to reach after
          a great work, that spoils the life of many a one.<a href="#page_446"><span class="ft41">9</span></a></p>
      <p>Many admire the broad, deep river which moves majestically in its onward course to the ocean. It is worthy of
          admiration; for it is doing its appointed work. But what of the thousand rivulets from the mountain side,
          which help to swell this noble stream? It is true that they are small and narrow; but they are indispensable,
          for without them the river could not exist. They are unitedly doing their appointed work in fertilizing the
          earth; their path through fields and meadows can be traced by the living green that lines their banks. Thus
          they are carrying out God’s plan, and adding to the prosperity of the world. The mighty river has worn for
          itself a channel through the everlasting hills; but in its place the brook is as necessary as the
          river....</p>
      <p>Each individual member is responsible for the prosperity of the church. The world is full of work for the
          Master. Every day brings its burden of care and responsibility; and if just one neglects the work assigned
          him, some sacred interest suffers.<a href="#page_446"><span class="ft42">10</span></a></p>
      <p>It is the conscientious attention to what the world calls little things that makes the great beauty and success
          of life. Little deeds of charity, little words of kindness, little acts of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> a wise
          improvement of little opportunities, a diligent cultivation of little talents, make great men in God’s
          sight.<a href="#page_446"><span class="ft42">11</span></a></p>
      <p>Thoughtful courtesies, that, commencing in our families, extend</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[254]</span><span class="ft34">outside the family circle, help make up the sum of life’s
          happiness.</span><a href="#page_446"><span class="ft35">12</span></a></p>
