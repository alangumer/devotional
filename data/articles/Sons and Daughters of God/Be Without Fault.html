    <h1>Be Without Fault, December 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without</strong></p>
      <p>fault before the throne of God. <span class="ft44">Revelation 14:5</span>.</p>
      <p>Sin is a hateful thing. It marred the moral beauty of a large number of the angels. It entered our world, and
          <nobr>well-nigh</nobr> obliterated the moral image of God in man. But in His great love God provided a way
          whereby man might regain the position from which he fell in yielding to the tempter. Christ came to stand at
          the head of humanity, to work out in our behalf a perfect character.... “As many as received</p>
      <p>him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.” ...</p>
      <p>What does the Lord require of His <nobr>blood-bought</nobr><nobr>heritage?—The</nobr> sanctification of the
          whole <nobr>being,—purity</nobr> like the purity of Christ, perfect conformity to the will of God.... Into the
          holy city there can</p>
      <p>enter nothing that defileth, or maketh a lie....</p>
      <p>We can reveal the likeness of our divine Lord. We can know the science of spiritual life. We can honor our
          Maker....</p>
      <p>Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God’s ideal for His children. He wants our minds to be
          clear, our tempers sweet, our love abounding. Then the peace that passeth knowledge will flow from us to bless
          all with whom we come in contact. The atmosphere surrounding our souls will be refreshing....</p>
      <p>Many are holding onto the truth with but the tips of their fingers. The precious time that should be spent in
          speaking of the Saviour’s power to save, is being spent by many in carrying evil reports. Unless they make a
          decided change, they will be found wanting. Unless they have an entire transformation of character, they will
          never enter heaven.... The truly converted man has no inclination to think or talk</p>
      <p>of the faults of others. His lips are sanctified, and as God’s witness he testifies that the grace of Christ
          has transformed his heart.... Those</p>
      <p>only will enter heaven who have overcome the temptation to think</p>
