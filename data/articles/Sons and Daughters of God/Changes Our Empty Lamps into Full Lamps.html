      <p>The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. <span class="ft44">Matthew 25:4</span>.</p>
      <p>Let every youth consider the parable of the ten virgins. All had lamps, that is, an outward semblance of
          religion; but only five of them had the inward piety. Five of them were wanting in the oil of grace. The
          Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, the Holy Spirit, was not abiding in their hearts. Without the oil of grace, of
          what use was it to bear about a lamp of profession? However high may be the profession, however high may be
          the position held by a professor of religion, if the oil of grace is wanting, he has nothing with which to
          feed his lamp, and it cannot send forth clear, shining rays of light....</p>
      <p>The reason why the Bridegroom delays is because He is long- suffering to <nobr>us-ward,</nobr> not willing that
          any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. O the precious longsuffering of our mer- ciful
          Saviour! O that each of the dear youth would appreciate the value of the soul that has been purchased at
          infinite cost on Calvary! O that each one would place a proper estimate upon the capabilities that have been
          given him of God! Through Christ you may climb the ladder of progress, and bring every power under the control
          of Jesus.... In spirit, in thought, in word, and in action, you may make</p>
      <p>manifest that you are moved by the Spirit of Christ, and your life may wield a power of influence over
          others.</p>
      <p>We are living in altogether too solemn a period of the worldâ€™s history to be careless and negligent.... You
          must pray, believe, and</p>
      <p>obey. In your own strength you can do nothing; but in the grace of Jesus Christ, you can employ your powers in
          such a way as to bring the greatest good to your own soul, and the greatest blessing to the souls of others.
          Lay hold of Jesus, and you will diligently work the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[119]</span><span class="ft34">works of Christ, and will finally receive the eternal
          reward.</span><a href="#page_421"><span class="ft35">53</span></a></p>
