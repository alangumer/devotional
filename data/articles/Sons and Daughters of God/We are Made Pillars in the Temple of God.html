    <h1>We are Made Pillars in the Temple of God, December</h1>

      <p>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out; and I will write
          upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out
          of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. <span class="ft36">Revelation 3:12</span>.</p>
      <p>The only hope of any man lies through Jesus Christ.... The pure</p>
      <p>and holy garments are not prepared to be put on by any one after he has entered the gate of the city. All who
          enter will have on the robe of Christ’s righteousness, and the name of God will be seen in their foreheads.
          This name is the symbol which the apostle saw in vision, and signifies the yielding of the mind to intelligent
          and loyal obedience to all of God’s commandments.<a href="#page_464"><span class="ft41">59</span></a></p>
      <p>The conflict that we are passing through is the last we shall have in this world. We are now in the midst of
          it. Two parties are striving for the supremacy. In this conflict we cannot be neutral. We must stand either on
          one side or on the other. If we take our position on the side of Christ, if we acknowledge Him before the
          world in word and work, we are bearing a living testimony as to whom we have chosen to serve and honor. In
          this important period of earth’s history, we cannot afford to leave any one in uncertainty as to whose side we
          are on....</p>
      <p>In order to gain the victory over every besetment of the enemy, we must lay hold on a power that is out of and
          beyond ourselves. We must maintain a constant, living connection with Christ, who has power to give victory to
          every soul that will maintain an attitude of faith and humility.... As those who hope to receive the
          overcomer’s</p>
      <p>reward, we must press forward in the Christian warfare, though at every advance we meet with opposition.... As
          overcomers, we are</p>
      <p>to reign with Christ in the heavenly courts, and we are to overcome through the blood of the Lamb and the word
          of our testimony. “Him</p>
