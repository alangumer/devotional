      <p>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <span class="ft44">Matthew 22:39</span>.</p>
      <p>The divine law requires us to love God supremely, and our neigh- bor as ourselves. Without the exercise of this
          love, the highest profes- sion of faith is mere hypocrisy.<a href="#page_409"><span
          class="ft42">39</span></a></p>
      <p>The worshiper of God will find that he cannot cherish one fiber of the root of selfishness. He cannot do his
          duty to his God and practice oppression toward his fellow men. The second principle of the law is like unto
          the first, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” “This do and thou shalt live.” These are the words of
          Jesus Christ from which there can be no departure on the part of any man, woman, or youth who would be a true
          Christian. It is obedience to the principles of the commandments of God, that molds the character after the
          divine similitude....</p>
      <p>To leave a suffering neighbor unrelieved is a breach of the law of God.... He who loves God will not only love
          his fellow men, but will</p>
      <p>regard with tender compassion the creatures which God has made. When the Spirit of God is in man it leads him
          to relieve rather than to create suffering.... We are to care for every case of suffering, and</p>
      <p>to look upon ourselves as God’s agents to relieve the needy to the very uttermost of our ability. We are to be
          laborers together with God. There are some who manifest great affection for their relatives, for their friends
          and favorites, who yet fail to be kind and considerate to those who need tender sympathy, who need kindness
          and love. With earnest heart, let us inquire, Who is my neighbor? Our neighbors are not merely our neighbors
          and special friends, are not simply those who belong to our church or who think as we do. Our neighbors are
          the whole human family. We are to do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of
          faith. We are to give to the world an exhibition of what it means to carry out the law of God. We are to</p>
