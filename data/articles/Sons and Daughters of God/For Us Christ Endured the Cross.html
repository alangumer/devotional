      <p><strong>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
          of the cross.</strong></p>
      <p>Philippians 2:8<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>For the joy that was set before Him, Christ endured the cross, despising the shame, and is forever set down at
          the right hand of God. He died on the cross as a sacrifice for the world, and through this sacrifice comes the
          greatest blessing that God could <nobr>bestow,—the</nobr> gift of the Holy Spirit. This blessing is for all
          who will receive Christ.</p>
      <p>The fallen world is the <nobr>battle-field</nobr> for the greatest conflict the heavenly universe and earthly
          powers have ever witnessed. It was appointed as the theater on which would be fought out the grand struggle

          faithful soldiers, that they may inherit the crown of life. They have been adopted as sons and daughters of
          God. Christ has left them His assured promise that great will be the reward in the kingdom of heaven of those
          who partake of His humiliation and suffering for the truth’s sake.</p>
      <p>The cross of Calvary challenges, and will finally vanquish, every earthly and hellish power. In the cross all
          influence centers, and from it all influence goes forth. It is the great center of attraction, for on it
          Christ gave up His life for the human race. This sacrifice was offered for the purpose of restoring man to his
          original perfection; yea, more. It was offered to give him an entire transformation of character, making him
          more than a conqueror. Those who in the strength of Christ overcome the great enemy of God and man, will
          occupy a position in the heavenly courts above angels who have never</p>
