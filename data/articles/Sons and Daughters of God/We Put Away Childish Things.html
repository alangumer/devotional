    <h1>We Put Away Childish Things, November 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I</strong></p>
      <p>thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away</p>
      <p><span class="ft11">childish things.</span>1 Corinthians 13:11<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>We are not always to remain children in our knowledge and expe- rience in spiritual things. We are not always
          to express ourselves in the language of one who has just received Christ; but our prayers and exhortations are
          to grow in intelligence as we advance in experience in the truth. The language of a child of six in a child of
          ten years of age would not be pleasing to us, and how painful would it be to hear expressions of childish
          intelligence in one who had arrived at years of maturity. When a person becomes of age, we expect from him a
          corresponding intelligence, according to his years and opportuni- ties.... But if we expect this manifestation
          of growing intelligence in</p>
      <p>the child, as he advances in years, should we not also expect to see the Christian grow in grace and
          experience? ...</p>
      <p>God has given us many advantages and opportunities, and when the last great day shall be ushered in, and we
          shall see what we might have attained, had we taken advantage of the helps that Heaven vouchsafed to us; when
          we see how we might have grown in grace, and look upon these things as God looks upon them, seeing what we
          have lost by failing to grow up into the full stature of men and women in Christ, we shall wish that we had
          been more in earnest.<a href="#page_457"><span class="ft43">39</span></a></p>
      <p>God does not desire you to remain novices. He needs in His work everything that you can gain here in the lines
          of mental culture and clear discernment. He desires to have you reach the very highest round of the ladder,
          and then step off it into the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>The Lord desires you to understand the position you occupy as</p>
