      <p><strong>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,</strong></p>
      <p>and I in him. <span class="ft44">John 6:56</span>.</p>
      <p>The contemplation of the Word of God will make us wise unto salvation; the knowledge of this Word will insure
          our happiness, and our success in the perfection of Christian character.</p>
      <p>All who in faith receive the Word of God will be doers of that Word. Their minds will be enlarged by a true
          knowledge, which Christ represents as eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. And as they
          practise the truth, they hold forth the Word of life to others. Thus they become an influence among
          influences, a savor of life unto life.</p>
      <p>Christ said: “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you,
          they are spirit, and they are life.” “He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in
          him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by
          me. This is that bread which came down from heaven....”</p>
      <p>Satan will do everything he can to satisfy the appetite for food that does not pertain to the knowledge of the
          only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Those who retain the grosser traits of character, who
          continue to reveal human defects in their words and disposition, bear testimony that they are not eating the
          flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God.<a href="#page_453"><span class="ft32">41</span></a></p>
      <p>It is the Word of God abiding in the heart that will quicken the spiritual faculties....</p>
      <p>Jesus has loved men, and has made every provision that the blood- bought soul shall have a new birth, a new
          life derived from His own life.... “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of</p>
      <p>God hath not life.” Those who believe in Christ derive their motive power and the texture of their characters
          from Him in whom they</p>
