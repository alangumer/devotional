      <p><strong>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall</strong></p>
      <p>ye be my disciples. <span class="ft44">John 15:8</span>.</p>
      <p>The union between Christ and His people is to be living, true, and unfailing, resembling the union that exists
          between the Father and the Son. This union is the fruit of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. All true
          children of God will reveal to the world their union with Christ and with their brethren. Those in whose

          manifestation of love for his brethren, the doing of Christlike deeds. This is the most wonderful witness that
          can be borne in favor of Christianity, and will win souls to the truth....</p>
      <p>Christ brings all true believers into complete oneness with Him- self, even the oneness which exists between
