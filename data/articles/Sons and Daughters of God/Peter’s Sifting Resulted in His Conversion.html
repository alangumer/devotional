    <h1>Peter’s Sifting Resulted in His Conversion, March 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
          but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
          <span class="ft36">Luke 22:31, 32</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The reason so many of Christ’s professed disciples fall into grievous temptation is that they have not a
          correct knowledge of themselves. Here is where Peter was so thoroughly sifted by the enemy. If we could
          understand our own weakness, we should see so much to do for ourselves that we would humble our hearts under
          the mighty hand of God. Hanging our helpless souls upon Christ, we would supplement our ignorance with His
          wisdom, our weakness with His strength, our frailty with His enduring might. Peter fell because he did not
          know his own frailty. He thought himself strong....</p>
      <p>Had Peter walked humbly with God, hiding self in Christ; had he earnestly looked for divine help; had he been
          less <nobr>self-confident;</nobr> had he received the Lord’s instruction and practised it, he would have been
          watching unto prayer.... Had he closely examined himself, the</p>
      <p>Lord would have given him divine help and there would have been no need of Satan’s sifting.... There is no
          power in the whole satanic</p>
      <p>force that can disable the soul that trusts, in simple confidence, in the wisdom that comes from God.<a

      <p>The <nobr>watch-care</nobr> of Christ for Peter was the cause of his restoration. Satan could do nothing
          against the <nobr>all-powerful</nobr> intercession of Christ. And the prayer that Christ offered for Peter He
          offers in behalf of all who are humble and contrite in heart.... Peter sinned against light</p>
      <p>and knowledge, and against great and exalted privileges. It was self- confidence that caused him to fail, and
          it is this same evil that is now working in human hearts. It may be our purpose to be right and to do right,
          but we shall most surely err unless we are constant learners in the school of Christ. Our only safety is in
          walking humbly with</p>
