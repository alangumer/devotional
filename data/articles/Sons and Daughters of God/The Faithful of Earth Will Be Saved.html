      <p><strong>And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect
          from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. <span class="ft36">Matthew
          24:31</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>In the power of Him who rides forth conquering and to conquer, weak, finite man may gain the victory.<a

      <p>The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obedient and
          faithful. The pillar of fire that speaks terror and wrath to the transgressor of God’s law, is a token of
          light and mercy and deliverance to those who have kept His commandments. The arm strong to smite the
          rebellious will be strong to deliver the loyal. Everyone who is faithful will be saved. “He shall send his
          angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one
          end of heaven to the other.”</p>

          shield of Omnipotence. God is always a majority. When the sound of the last trump shall penetrate the
          <nobr>prison-house</nobr> of the dead, and the righteous shall come forth with triumph, exclaiming, “O death,
          where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy <nobr>victory?”—standing</nobr> then with God, with Christ, with the
          angels, and the loyal and true of all ages, the children of God will be far in the majority....</p>
      <p>In holy vision the prophet saw the ultimate triumph of God’s remnant church. He writes: “I saw as it were a sea
          of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory ... stand on the sea of glass, having the
          harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and
          marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy</p>
