    <h1>We Receive a Faith that Works by Love, March 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which
          worketh by love. <span class="ft45">Galatians 5:6</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>When you present your petitions to the Lord, it should be in humility, without boasting of superior
          attainments, but with real soul hunger for the blessing of God. Christ always knows what is cherished in the
          heart. We must come in faith that the Lord will hear and answer our prayers; for “whatsoever is not of faith
          is sin.” Genuine faith is the faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. A living faith will be a
          working faith. Should we go into the garden and find that there was no sap in the plants, no freshness in the
          leaves, no bursting buds or blooming flowers, no signs of life in stalk or branches, we would say, “The plants
          are dead. Uproot them from the garden; for they are a deformity to the beds.” So it is with those who profess
          Christianity, and have no spirituality. If there are no signs of religious vigor, if there is no doing of the
          commandments of the Lord, it is evident that there is no abiding in Christ, the living vine.<a

      <p>Faith and love are the essential, powerful, working elements of Christian character. Those who possess them are
          one with Christ, and are carrying forward His mission.... We are to sit at Christ’s feet</p>
      <p>as continual learners, and to work with His gifts of faith and love. We shall then wear Christ’s yoke, and lift
          His burdens, and Christ will recognize us as one with Him; in heaven it will be said, “Ye are labourers
          together with God.” Will our youth remember that without faith it is impossible to please God? and it must be
          faith that works by love and purifies the soul.<a href="#page_413"><span class="ft42">13</span></a></p>
      <p>We cannot overestimate the value of simple faith and unquestion- ing obedience. It is by following in the path
          of obedience in simple</p>
