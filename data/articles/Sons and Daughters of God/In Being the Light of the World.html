    <h1>In Being the Light of the World, May 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not
          walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. <span class="ft36">John 8:12</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>It was morning; the sun had just risen above the Mount of Olives, and its rays fell with dazzling brightness on
          the marble palaces, and lighted up the gold of the temple walls, when Jesus, pointing to it, said, “I am the
          light of the world.”</p>
      <p>By one who listened to these words, they were long afterward <nobr>re-echoed</nobr> in that sublime passage,
          “In him was life; and the life was the light of men.”<a href="#page_425"><span class="ft41">34</span></a></p>
      <p>Those who are sanctified through the truth, are as bright, shining lights, giving light to all that are in the
          house. Good works will be revealed in every true believer. The Lord can accept of nothing short of perfection
          of character, wholeness to God. Any <nobr>half-hearted</nobr> service will testify before the heavenly
          intelligences that you have failed to copy the Pattern.<a href="#page_425"><span
          class="ft42">35</span></a></p>
      <p>Christ’s followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men. They are the light of the world. Jesus says
          to all who have named His name, You have given yourselves to Me, and I have given you to the world as My
          representatives. As the Father had sent Him into the world, so He declares, “have I also sent them into the
          world.” ...</p>
      <p>While our Saviour is the great source of illumination, forget not, O Christian, that He is revealed through
          humanity. God’s blessings are bestowed through human instrumentality.... Angels of glory wait to</p>
      <p>communicate through you heaven’s light and power to souls that are ready to perish.... If Christ is dwelling in
          the heart, it is impossible to</p>
      <p>conceal the light of His presence.<a href="#page_425"><span class="ft35">36</span></a></p>
      <p>When the Light of the world passes by, privileges appear in all hardships, order in confusion, the success and
          wisdom of God in that which has seemed to be failure.<a href="#page_425"><span class="ft42">37</span></a></p>
