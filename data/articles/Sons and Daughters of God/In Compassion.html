    <h1>In Compassion, May 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he
          healed their sick. <span class="ft36">Matthew 14:14</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Let me point you to the life of Christ, to His compassion, His humility and love, His inexpressible tenderness.
          You are to copy His example. God has given you life and all the rich blessings that make it enjoyable, and in
          return He has claims upon you for service, for gratitude, for love, for obedience to His law. These claims are
          of the first importance, and cannot be lightly disregarded; but He requires nothing of you that will not make
          you happier, even in this life.<a href="#page_426"><span class="ft33">58</span></a></p>
      <p>The Majesty of heaven identifies His interests with that of suffer- ing humanity. Our associates and companions
          are in need of heartfelt kindness and tender sympathy.... It is impossible to grow up into</p>
      <p>Christ our living head, unless we practice the lesson He has given us of sympathy, compassion, and love. It is
          impossible to reflect the image of Christ unless this love which is of heavenly birth, is in the soul. No one
          will pass the portals of the city of God who does not reflect this attribute.<a href="#page_426"><span
          class="ft42">59</span></a></p>
      <p>One unsanctified act on the part of our Saviour, would have marred the pattern, and He could not have been a
          perfect example for us; but although He was tempted in all points like as we are, He was yet without one taint
          of sin. He proclaims His character by the mouth of the prophet saying, “I am the Lord which exercise
          <nobr>loving-kindness,</nobr> judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight.” All
          who profess the name of Christ should delight in these things, by conversation and conduct making manifest to
          the world that they are copying the Pattern.... Whoever believes in Christ must do the</p>
      <p>works of Christ. The Lord has been presented before them as one who exercises <nobr>loving-kindness,</nobr>
          judgment, and righteousness in the earth,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[149]</span><span class="ft34">and these are the fruits that are borne by the genuine
          Christian.</span><a href="#page_426"><span class="ft35">60</span></a></p>
