    <h1>Choose Today to Serve Christ Always, June 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the
          gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose
          land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. <span class="ft36">Joshua
          24:15</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>We have been bought with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish. What a price is this,
          unparalleled, infinite! But though Christ has bought us, and invites us to come to Him, still the world holds
          out its attractions to us, and strives for the mastery. Shall love for God, or love for the world, triumph in
          the conflict? Satan and his evil angels are watching at every avenue leading to the human heart, seeking to
          force souls to accept evil suggestions. The enemy presents bribes to win us to the world, as he presented
          bribes to Christ in the wilderness of temptation. Unless we depend upon a power out of and above ourselves,
          the enemy will succeed in accomplishing our ruin. But in looking to Jesus, by studying His life and character,
          by earnestly desiring to be like Him, our minds will be balanced in the right direction, that we may overcome
          selfishness, and choose a course of righteousness....</p>
      <p>I appeal to the youth: “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” There is a necessity for a decided choice; for
          Jesus said, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” ...</p>
      <p>If your heart is filled with love to Christ, it will be demonstrated that He is stronger than the passions
          which have ruled you, whose indulgence have undermined noble impulses, and left the soul to the mercy of
          Satan’s temptations.... When the heart of the sinner is</p>
      <p>touched, he yields his will to God’s will.... He sees in Jesus matchless</p>
