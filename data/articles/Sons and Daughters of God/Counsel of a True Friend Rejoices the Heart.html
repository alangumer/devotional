    <h1>Counsel of a True Friend Rejoices the Heart, June 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness</strong></p>
      <p>of a man’s friend by hearty counsel. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 27:9</span>.</p>
      <p>Things will go wrong with every one; sadness and discouragement press every soul; then a personal presence, a
          friend who will comfort and impart strength, will turn back the darts of the enemy that are aimed to destroy.
          Christian friends are not half as plentiful as they should be. In hours of temptation, in a crisis, what a
          value is a true friend! Satan at such times sends along his agents to cause the trembling limbs to stumble;
          but the true friends who will counsel, who will impart magnetic hopefulness, the calming faith that uplifts
          the <nobr>soul,—oh,</nobr> such help is worth more than precious pearls.<a href="#page_429"><span

      <p>The life of Samuel from early childhood had been a life of piety and devotion. He had been placed under the
          care of Eli in his youth, and the loveliness of his character drew forth the warm affection of the aged
          priest. He was kind, generous, diligent, obedient, and respect- ful.... It was a singular thing that between
          Eli, the chief magistrate of</p>
      <p>the nation, and the simple child so warm a friendship should exist. Samuel was helpful and affectionate, and no
          father ever loved his child more tenderly than did Eli this youth....</p>
      <p>How touching to see youth and old age relying one upon the other, the youth looking up to the aged for counsel
          and wisdom, the aged looking to the youth for help and sympathy. This is as it should be. God would have the
          young possess such qualification of character that they shall find delight in the friendship of the old, that
          they may be united in the endearing bonds of affection to those who are approaching the borders of the
          grave.<a href="#page_429"><span class="ft33">5</span></a></p>
      <p>A strong, helpful grasp of the hand of a true friend is worth more</p>
