      <p>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us,
          by the Spirit which he hath given us. <span class="ft36">1 John 3:24</span>.</p>
      <p>God requires us to be faithful in the smallest details of <nobr>life,—to</nobr> guard our words, our spirit,
          and our actions. To do this, we need to acquire perfect <nobr>self-control,</nobr> and this will demand of us
          constant, ceaseless watchfulness....</p>
      <p>Were self kept under control, serious errors in home and business life would be avoided. Among the members of
          many families there is practised the habit of saying loose, careless things, and the habit of tantalizing, of
          speaking harsh words, becomes stronger and stronger as it is indulged, and thus many objectionable words are
          spoken that are after Satan’s order, and not after the order of God. Should those who indulge in speaking
          words of passion, study the Guide Book, and with a serious mind seek to know its requirements, and to do
          them,— should they make practical its <nobr>injunctions,—what</nobr> a transformation would there be in the
          conduct and conversation! ... Every relation in life, every position of responsibility, every affection and
          habit, every emotion of the mind, is to be brought to the great standard of righteousness, the commandments of
          God, which are exceeding broad. We must have simplicity of heart that we may understand, and willingness of
          mind to practise, all the teachings of God’s Word....</p>
      <p>The whole mind must be molded by the Holy Spirit. Divine power will combine with human effort, when we seek
          earnestly to be complete in Christ Jesus. The Lord will help every one who seeks Him with all his heart. He
          shall have the light of life, and that light shines from the living oracles. As the light of the sun sheds its
          warmth throughout all the world, so the bright beams of the Sun of</p>
