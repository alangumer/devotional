    <h1>He Will Be to Us a Sanctuary, December 13</h1>

      <p><strong>For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
          hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. <span class="ft36">Psalm 27:5</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>There is joy and consolation for the <nobr>true-hearted,</nobr> faithful Christian, that the world knows not
          of. To them it is a mystery. The Christian’s hope is big with immortality and full of glory. It reacheth to
          that within the veil, and is as an anchor to the soul, both sure and steadfast. And when the storm of God’s
          wrath shall come upon the ungodly, this hope will not fail them, but they are hid as in the secret of His
          pavilion.<a href="#page_461"><span class="ft42">20</span></a></p>
      <p>There are troublous times before us; the judgments of God are coming upon our world. The nations of the earth
          are to tremble. There will be trials and perplexities on every hand; men’s hearts will fail them for fear. And
          what shall we do in that day? Though the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and be removed like a
          cottage, if we have made God our trust, He will deliver us. “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most
          High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” “Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even
          the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee....</p>
      <p>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”<a href="#page_461"><span
          class="ft42">21</span></a></p>
      <p>Christ sees the termination of the conflict. The battle is waging more and more fiercely. Soon He will come
          whose right it is, and will take possession of all earthly things. All the confusion in our world, all the
          violence and crime, are a fulfilment of the words of Christ. They are the signs of the nearness of His coming.
          In that day of His coming, Christ will preserve those who have followed Him, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
          He has pledged Himself to be their sanctuary. He says to them, Enter thou into a safe retreat for a little
          moment, and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[355]</span><span class="ft34">hide thee until I shall cleanse the earth from her
          iniquity.</span><a href="#page_461"><span class="ft35">22</span></a></p>
