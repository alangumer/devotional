    <h1>Statutes Given for Our Good Always, February 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that
          he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. <span class="ft36">Deuteronomy 6:24</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>As the youth go out into the world, to encounter its allurements to <nobr>sin,—the</nobr> passion for
          <nobr>money-getting,</nobr> for amusement and indulgence, for display, luxury, and extravagance, the
          overreaching, fraud, robbery and <nobr>ruin,—what</nobr> are the teachings there to be met?</p>
      <p>Spiritualism asserts that men are unfallen demigods; that “each mind will judge itself”; that “true knowledge
          places men above all law”; that “all sins committed are innocent”; for “whatever is, is right,” and “God doth
          not condemn.” The basest of human beings it represents as in heaven, and highly exalted there.... Multitudes

          foundations of character. In every generation and in every land the true foundation and pattern for
          <nobr>character-building</nobr> have been the same. The divine law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God will all
          thy heart, ... and thy neighbour as thyself,” the great principle made manifest in the character and life of
          our Saviour, is the only secure foundation and the only sure guide....</p>
      <p>Here is the only safeguard for individual integrity, for the purity of the home, the <nobr>well-being</nobr> of
          society, or the stability of the nation. Amidst all life’s perplexities and dangers and conflicting claims,
