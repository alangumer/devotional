    <h1>With a Happy Sabbath Day of Worship and Rest,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>June 23</strong></p>
      <p>Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, ... ye shall do no work therein: it is
          the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings. <span class="ft36">Leviticus 23:3</span>.</p>
      <p>Whatever of ours God claims from us, He returns again, enriched, transfigured, with His own glory....</p>
      <p>The Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in Eden, and in God’s purpose they are indissolubly linked
          together. On this day more than on any other, it is possible for us to live the life of Eden. It was God’s
          plan for the members of the family to be associated in work and study, in worship and recreation, the father
          as priest of his household, and both father and mother as teachers and companions of their children. But the
          results of sin, having changed the conditions of life, to a great degree prevent this association. Often the
          father hardly sees the faces of his children throughout the week. He is almost wholly deprived of opportunity
          for companionship or instruction. But God’s love has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over the Sabbath He
          places His merciful hand. In His own day He preserves for the family opportunity for communion with Him, with
          nature, and with one another.</p>
      <p>Since the Sabbath is the memorial of creative power, it is the day above all others when we should acquaint
          ourselves with God through His works.... Happy the father and mother who can teach</p>
      <p>their children God’s written Word with illustrations from the open pages of the book of nature; who can gather
          under the green trees, in the fresh, pure air, to study the Word and to sing the praise of the Father
          above.</p>
      <p>By such associations parents may bind their children to their hearts, and thus to God, by ties that can never
          be broken.<a href="#page_434"><span class="ft41">79</span></a></p>
      <p>The Sabbath should be made so interesting to our families that its</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[182]</span><span class="ft34">weekly return will be hailed with joy.</span><a
