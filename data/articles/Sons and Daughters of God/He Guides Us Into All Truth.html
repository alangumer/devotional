    <h1>He Guides Us Into All Truth, January 23</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak
          of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <span
          class="ft36">John 16:13</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Every servant of God is to be guided by the Holy Spirit. It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. Our
          path, however rugged it may be, is marked out for us by the Lord; and in it we must walk.<a
          href="#page_405"><span class="ft33">64</span></a>Christ has made provision that His church shall be a
          transformed body, illumined with the light of heaven, possessing the glory of Immanuel. It is His purpose that
          every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere of light and peace. There is no limit to the
          usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart
          and lives a life wholly</p>
      <p>consecrated to God....</p>
      <p>To us today, as verily as to the first disciples, the promise of the Spirit belongs. God will today endow men
          and women with power from above, as He endowed those who on the Day of Pentecost heard the word of salvation.
          At this very hour His Spirit and His grace are for all who need them and will take Him at His word.<a
          href="#page_405"><span class="ft32">65</span></a></p>
      <p>Teach your children that it is their privilege to receive every day the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a
          href="#page_405"><span class="ft42">66</span></a></p>
      <p>Those who are under the influence of the Spirit of God will not be fanatical, but calm and steadfast, free from
          extravagance in thought, word, or deed. Amid the confusion of delusive doctrines, the Spirit of God will be a
          guide and a shield to those who have not resisted the evidences of truth, silencing every other voice but that
          which comes from Him who is the truth.<a href="#page_405"><span class="ft42">67</span></a></p>
      <p>A holy influence is to go forth to the world from those who are sanctified through the truth.... The Holy
          Spirit is to work on human</p>
