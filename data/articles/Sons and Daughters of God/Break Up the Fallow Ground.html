    <h1>Break Up the Fallow Ground, November 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek
          the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. <span class="ft36">Hosea 10:12</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The principles of the truth must be interwoven with our character and life. We should cherish every ray of
          light that falls upon our pathway, and live up to the requirements of God. We should grow in spirituality. We
          are losing a great deal of the blessing ... because we do not take advance steps in the Christian
          life....</p>
      <p>The members of the church of Christ should gather up the divine rays of light from Jesus, and reflect them to
          others, leaving a bright track heavenward in the world. They are to be as the wise virgins, having their lamps
          trimmed and burning, representing the character of Christ to the world. We are not to be satisfied with
          anything short of this. We are not to be satisfied with our own righteousness, and content without the deep
          movings of the Spirit of God.</p>
      <p>Christ says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” It is this marked nothingness, so apparent in the labors of many
          ... that alarms us; for we know that this is an evidence that they have not felt the converting power of
          Christ upon their hearts. You may look from the topmost bough to the lowest branch of their work, and you will
          find nothing but leaves. God desires us to come up to a higher standard. It is not His will that we should
          have such a dearth of spirituality....</p>
      <p>I remember visiting in Iowa when the country was new, and I saw the farmers breaking the new ground. I noticed
          that they had heavy teams, and made tremendous efforts to make deep furrows, but the laborers gained strength
          and muscle by the exercise of their physical powers. It will make our young men strong to go into new fields,
          and break up the fallow ground of men’s hearts. This work will drive them nearer to God.... They will gain
          efficiency and ability by mastering</p>
