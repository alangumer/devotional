    <h1>He Calls Us to the Marriage Supper, December 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of</strong></p>
      <p><span class="ft11">the Lamb.</span>Revelation 19:9<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He
          is effecting trans- formations so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his
          confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, stands viewing them as a fortress
          impregnable to his sophistries and delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of God,
          seraphim and cherubim, the powers commissioned to cooperate with human agencies, look on with aston- ishment
          and joy, that fallen men, once children of wrath, are through the training of Christ developing characters
          after the divine simili- tude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part in the occupations
          and pleasures of heaven.</p>
      <p>To His church, Christ has given ample facilities, that He may receive a large revenue of glory from His
          redeemed, purchased pos- session. The church, being endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His
          depository, in which the wealth of His mercy, His love, His grace, is to appear in full and final display. The
          declaration in His intercessory prayer, that the Father’s love is as great toward us as toward Himself, the
          <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son, and that we shall be with Him where He is, forever one with Christ and the
          Father, is a marvel to the heavenly host, and it is their great joy. The gift of His Holy Spirit, rich, full,
          and abundant, is to be to His church as an encompassing wall of fire, which the powers of hell shall not
          prevail against. In their untainted purity and spotless perfection, Christ looks upon His people as the reward
          of all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love, and the supplement of His <nobr>glory,—Christ,</nobr> the
          great center from which radiates all glory. “Blessed are they which are called unto the</p>
