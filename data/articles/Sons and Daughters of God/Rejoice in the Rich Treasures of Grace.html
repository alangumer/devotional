    <h1>Rejoice in the Rich Treasures of Grace, April 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine
          house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you. <span class="ft36">Deuteronomy
          26:11</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Thanksgiving and praise should be expressed to God for temporal blessings and for whatever comforts He bestows
          upon us. God would have every family that He is preparing to inhabit the eternal mansions above, give glory to
          Him for the rich treasures of His grace. Were children, in the home life, educated and trained to be grateful
          to the Giver of all good things, we would see an element of heavenly grace manifest in our families.
          Cheerfulness would be seen in the home life, and coming from such homes, the youth would bring a spirit of
          respect and reverence with them into the schoolroom, and into the church. There would be an attendance in the
          sanctuary where God meets with His people, a reverence for all the ordinances of His worship, and grateful
          praise and thanksgiving would be offered for all the gifts of His providence....</p>
      <p>Every temporal blessing would be received with gratitude, and ev- ery spiritual blessing become doubly precious
          because the perception of each member of the household had become sanctified by the Word of truth. The Lord
          Jesus is very near to those who thus appreciate His gracious gifts, tracing all their good things back to the
          benevolent, loving, <nobr>care-taking</nobr> God, and recognizing Him as the great Fountain of all comfort and
          consolation, the inexhaustible Source of grace.<a href="#page_422"><span class="ft43">61</span></a></p>
      <p>If we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that we know we
          <nobr>have,—the</nobr> great mercy and love of <nobr>God,—we</nobr> should have more faith and greater joy. No
          tongue can express, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating the goodness and
          love of God. Even on earth we may have joy as a wellspring, never failing, because fed by the streams</p>
