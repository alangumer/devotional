    <h1>We Receive the Crown of Life, December 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
          which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. <span class="ft36">James 1:12</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>When the Lord makes up His jewels, the true, the frank, the honest, will be looked upon with pleasure. Angels
          are employed in making crowns for such ones, and upon these <nobr>star-gemmed</nobr> crowns will be reflected,
          with splendor, the light which radiates from the throne of God.<a href="#page_462"><span
          class="ft41">40</span></a></p>
      <p>Talk of heavenly things. Talk of Jesus, His loveliness and glory, and of His undying love for you, and let your
          heart flow out in love and gratitude to Him, who died to save you. O, get ready to meet your Lord in peace.
          Those who are ready will soon receive an unfading crown of life, and will dwell forever in the kingdom of God,
          with Christ, with angels, and with those who have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.<a

      <p>It is the waiting ones who are to be crowned with glory, honor, and immortality. You need not talk ... of the
          honors of the world, or the praise of its great ones. They are all vanity. Let but the finger of God touch
          them, and they would soon go back to dust again. I want honor that is lasting, honor that is immortal, honor
          that will never perish; a crown that is richer than any crown that ever decked the brow of a monarch.<a
          href="#page_462"><span class="ft42">42</span></a></p>
      <p>In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and His Son. The angels of heaven,
          touching their golden harps, will welcome the King, and those who are the trophies of His victory,â€” those who
          have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph will peal forth, filling all
          heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts accompanied by His redeemed ones, the witnesses
          that His mission of suffering and self-</p>
