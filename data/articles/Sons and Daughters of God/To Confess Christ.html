    <h1>To Confess Christ, July 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God</strong></p>
      <p>dwelleth in him, and he in God. <span class="ft44">1 John 4:15</span>.</p>
      <p>The confession of which John here speaks, is not the result of a nominal faith, but is the result of an abiding
          faith in the living <nobr>Saviour,—the</nobr> result of believing that the blessings of salvation are brought
          within our reach through the sufferings and death of Christ, who was raised from the dead, and ever liveth to
          make intercession for us. We should feel assured that Jesus is our Saviour, and that life would not be
          enjoyable, nor afford us peace or hope, if He had not loved us and given Himself for us.<a
          href="#page_435"><span class="ft42">1</span></a></p>
      <p>Our claim to Christ’s righteousness is without a flaw, if we meet the conditions upon which it is promised. God
          has bestowed upon us all heaven in one rich gift, and whatever the gift includes is ours, if we accept Christ
          as our personal Saviour.... Speak of Jesus, educate</p>
      <p>the tongue to speak of His mercy, to tell of His power, showing forth the praises of Him who hath called you
          out of darkness into His marvelous light.<a href="#page_435"><span class="ft42">2</span></a></p>
      <p>Christian youth, you are a spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men. Be brave in God. Put on the whole
          armor of God, and let unbelievers about you see that your life is not spoiled because you stand loyal and true
          to all the commandments of God. You can be, and God requires you to be, a decided witness for Him.<a
          href="#page_435"><span class="ft33">3</span></a></p>
      <p>We need to dwell on the words of courage that Christ spoke to His disciples toward the close of His earthly
          ministry.... Though a cruel</p>
      <p>death was just before Him, Christ’s words to His followers were full of hope. He desired to bring all the
          comfort possible to their hearts.</p>
