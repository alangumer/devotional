    <h1>To be a Strength to All Nations, February 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy God hath commanded thy strength; strengthen, O God,</strong></p>
      <p>that which thou hast wrought for us. <span class="ft44">Psalm 68:28</span>.</p>
      <p>His [God’s] laws were not alone for the Jewish nation. The moral law was given before the people called Jews
          were in existence. The law of ten commandments was of universal obligation. The sacrificial ordinances were
          devised to represent the one great Sacrifice, the Lamb of God, that was to take away the sin of the world, and
          in behalf of the transgressor meet the requirements of divine justice.</p>
      <p>The Lord would not have His people exclusive. Christ’s delegated messengers are to proclaim the gospel of His
          grace to all nations, tongues, and people. We are to make it known that the Great Advo- cate is giving
          audience to the whole world. The Jewish church was called to be God’s representative to an apostate world, and
          in order to fulfill this mission the Jewish people were to maintain their own existence as a nation distinct
          from all the idolatrous nations upon the earth. They were to stand in the world maintaining their peculiar and
          holy character. They could maintain their own spirituality by doing that which Adam and Eve failed to
          <nobr>do,—by</nobr> rendering obedience to all the commandments of God, and in their characters representing
          God’s mercy, goodness, compassion, and love. Thus in excellence of character they could stand above every
          other nation; for through a pure and obedient people the Lord would manifest His rich blessings. Thus the
          principles of the laws governing His kingdom were to be exalted throughout the world. Just as surely as they
          responded to the mercy, the light, the grace given, they would become the light of the world. They would be
          constantly directing attention to God, as a wise, faultless, Supreme Ruler, and the praise of God would be in
          all the earth.... The Lord is our God, and He has the same purpose in regard</p>
