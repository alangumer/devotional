    <h1>Joseph a Christian Gentleman, November 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave</strong></p>
      <p>him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. <span class="ft44">Genesis</span></p>
      <p>39:21<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Joseph regarded his being sold into Egypt as the greatest calamity that could have befallen him; but he saw the
          necessity of trusting in God as he had never done when protected by his father’s love. Joseph brought God with
          him into Egypt, and the fact was made apparent by his cheerful demeanor amid his sorrow. As the ark of God
          brought rest and prosperity to Israel, so did this <nobr>God-loving,</nobr><nobr>God-fearing</nobr> youth
          bring a blessing to Egypt. This was manifested in so marked a manner that Potiphar, in whose house he served,
          attributed all his blessings to his purchased slave.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft33">21</span></a></p>
      <p>Joseph’s religion kept his temper sweet and his sympathy with humanity warm and strong, notwithstanding all his
          trials. There are those who if they feel they are not rightly used, become sour, ungenerous, crabbed and
          uncourteous in their words and deportment. They sink down discouraged, hateful and hating others. But Joseph
          was a Christian. No sooner does he enter upon prison life, than he brings all the brightness of his Christian
          principles into active exercise; he begins to make himself useful to others. He enters into the troubles of
          his fellow prisoners. He is cheerful, for he is a Christian gentleman. God was preparing him under this
          discipline for a situation of great responsibility, honor, and usefulness, and he was willing to learn; he
          took kindly to the lessons the Lord would teach him. He learned to bear the yoke in his youth. He learned to
          govern by first learning obedience himself....</p>
      <p>The part which Joseph acted in connection with the scenes of the gloomy prison, was that which raised him
          finally to prosperity and honor. God designed that he should obtain an experience by temptations, adversity,
          and hardships, to prepare him to fill an exalted position. Joseph carried his religion everywhere, and this
          was the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[321]</span><span class="ft34">secret of his unwavering fidelity.</span><a
