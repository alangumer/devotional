      <p>I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right</p>
      <p>hand, I shall not be moved. <span class="ft44">Psalm 16:8</span>.</p>
      <p>Amid the perplexities that will press upon the soul, there is only One who can help us out of all our
          difficulties, and relieve all our disquietude. We are to cast all our care upon Jesus, and bear in mind that
          He is present, and is directing us to commune with Him. We are to keep our minds stayed upon God; and in our
          weakness, He will be our strength; in our ignorance, He will be our wisdom; in our frailty, He will be our
          enduring might.</p>
      <p>We may be assured that we need not go into the heavens to bring Jesus down to us, neither into the deep to
          bring Him up; for He is at our right hand, and His eye is ever upon us. We should ever seek to realize that
          the Lord is very near us, to be our counselor and guide. This is the only way in which we may have confidence
          toward God.</p>
      <p>We need to educate and train the mind so that we shall have an intelligent faith, and have an understanding
          friendship with Jesus. Unless we continually cherish friendship between God and our souls, we shall separate
          from Him, and walk apart from Him. We shall make friends of those around us, and place our trust in humanity,
          and our affections will be diverted from the true object of worship. We must not allow coldness to chill our
          love for our Redeemer. If we have fellowship with Him, we must ever set the Lord before us, and treat Him as
          an honored Friend, giving Him the first place in our affections. We should speak of His matchless charms, and
          constantly cultivate the desire to have a better knowledge of Jesus Christ. Then His Spirit will have a
          controlling power upon life and character.... If ever there</p>
      <p>was a time when men needed the presence of Christ at their right hand, it is now.... We need the Captain of our
          salvation continually</p>
