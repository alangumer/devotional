      <p>Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be
          their God, and they shall be my people. <span class="ft36">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>.</p>
      <p>We are to obey the laws of His kingdom, making ourselves all that it is possible for us to be. Earnestly we are
          to cultivate the highest powers of our being, remembering that we are God’s property, God’s building. We are
          required to improve every day. Even in this world of sin and sorrow, we may, by earnest, persevering effort,
          rise to the highest spiritual efficiency.... We are to please God. This we may do;</p>
      <p>for Enoch pleased God, though living in a degenerate age. And there are Enochs in this our day.</p>
      <p>The human house, God’s building, His temple, requires close, vigilant, watchful guardianship. With David we can
          exclaim, “I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” God’s workmanship is to be preserved, that it may be revealed
          to the heavenly universe and to the apostate race that men and women are temples of the living God.</p>
      <p>The perfection of character which God requires is the fitting up of the whole being as a temple for the
          indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The Lord requires the service of the entire human machinery. He desires men and
          women to be all that He has made it possible for them to be. It is not enough for certain parts of the
          machinery to be used. All parts must be brought into action, or the service is deficient....</p>
      <p>The physical life is to be carefully educated, cultivated, and devel- oped, that through men and women the
          divine nature may be revealed in its fullness. God expects men to use the intellect He has given them. He
          expects them to use every reasoning power for Him. They are to give the conscience the place of supremacy that
          has been assigned it. The mental and physical powers, with the affections, are to be so</p>
