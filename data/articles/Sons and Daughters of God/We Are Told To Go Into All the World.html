    <h1>We Are Told To Go Into All the World, September 23</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the</strong></p>
      <p>gospel to every creature. <span class="ft44">Mark 16:15</span>.</p>
      <p>The Lord has given to the youth capabilities and talents with which they are to do the work of God. I ask you,
          dear youth, are you going to give yourselves to the Lord? Are you ready to engage in the work He has left you
          to do? Jesus said to His disciples, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” In
          the face of this command, will you appropriate your time and your energies as inclination may dictate, instead
          of following the counsel of God? ...</p>
      <p>There are souls to be saved. But in wasting your talent of influence, you cannot be laborers together with God,
          working for the salvation of others. God would have you rightfully direct every jot of influence you possess.
          He calls for you to whom He has given great light to cooperate with heavenly intelligences. Those who have
          great light and precious capabilities will have a large field in which their influence may tell unto life
          eternal; but if those who have been richly endowed of heaven, withhold their gifts from God’s service, and
          misapply them in the service of self and the world, they will be punished in proportion to the light which
          they have persistently refused. God has made the youth the depositaries of the truth that is to be imparted to
          the world.... Christ is calling for <nobr>whole-hearted,</nobr> sincere servants,</p>
      <p>who will not be turned from their position of duty by allurements or <nobr>opposition,—who</nobr> will not fail
          or be discouraged. Will you give Him your names? Will you be among those who shall be
          <nobr>light-bearers?</nobr> Will you give yourself to Him to be employed as His agents to arrest the steps of
          many who are going on the road to perdition?<a href="#page_449"><span class="ft32">54</span></a></p>
      <p>The work must extend from city to city, from country to country, and from nation to nation, moving continually
          onward and upward,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[274]</span><span class="ft34">established, strengthened, and settled.</span><a
