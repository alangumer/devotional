    <h1>Adorned With Divine Loveliness, November 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
          all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.</strong></p>
      <p>Psalm 27:4<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Exalted powers are within the reach of every one. Under God’s supervision, a man may have an uncorrupted,
          sanctified, elevated, ennobled mind. Through the grace of Christ, man’s mind is qualified to love and glorify
          God, the Creator.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus came to our world to represent the Father.... Christ</p>
      <p>was the express image of His Father’s person; and He came to our world to restore in man God’s moral image, in
          order that man although fallen, might through obedience to God’s commandments become enstamped with the divine
          image and character.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft32">15</span></a></p>
      <p>God wants children to be lovely, not with artificial adornment, but with beauty of character, the charms of
          kindness and affection, which will make their hearts bound with joy and happiness.<a href="#page_456"><span
          class="ft33">16</span></a></p>
      <p>Girls should be taught that the true charm of womanliness is not alone in beauty of form or feature, nor in the
          possession of accom- plishments; but in a meek and quiet spirit, in patience, generosity, kindness, and a
          willingness to do and suffer for others. They should be taught to work, to study to some purpose, to live for
          some object, to trust in God and fear Him, and to respect their parents. Then as they advance in years, they
          will grow more <nobr>pure-minded,</nobr><nobr>self-reliant,</nobr> and beloved. It will be impossible to
          degrade such a woman. She will escape the temptations and trials that have been the ruin of so many.<a

      <p>Christ was sent as our pattern and shall we not show that we have all His love and kindness and ... charms? And
          the love of Jesus Christ will take possession of our characters and our lives, and our</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[319]</span><span class="ft34">conversation will be holy and we will dwell on heavenly
          things.</span><a href="#page_456"><span class="ft35">18</span></a></p>
