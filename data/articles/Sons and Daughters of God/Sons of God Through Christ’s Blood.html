    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by</strong></p>
      <p>the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to
          say, his flesh.</p>
      <p>Hebrews 10:19, 20<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Christ was nailed to the cross between the third and sixth hour, that is between nine and twelve o’ clock. In
          the afternoon He died. This was the hour of the evening sacrifice. Then the veil of the temple, that which hid
          God’s glory from the view of the congregation of Israel, was rent in twain from top to bottom.</p>
      <p>Through Christ the hidden glory of the holy of holies was to stand revealed. He had suffered death for every
          man, and by this offering, the sons of men were to become the sons of God. With open face, beholding as in a
          glass the glory of the Lord, believers in Christ were to be changed into the same image, from glory to glory.

          as the propitiation for sin, and through its medium, they are brought into fellowship with God. The veil is
          rent, the partition walls broken down, the handwriting of ordinances cancelled. By virtue of His blood the
          enmity is abolished.<a href="#page_441"><span class="ft43">19</span></a></p>
      <p>The simple story of the cross of Christ, His suffering and dying for the world, His resurrection and ascension,
          His mediation in the sinner’s behalf before the Father, subdues and breaks the hard and sinful heart, and
          brings the sinner to repentance. The Holy Spirit sets the matter before him in a new light, and the sinner
          realizes that sin must be a tremendous evil to cost such a sacrifice to atone for it....</p>
      <p>How grievous must sin be that no less a remedy than the death of the Son of God could save man from the
          consequences of his guilt. Why was this done in behalf of <nobr>man?—It</nobr> was because God loved him, and
          was not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, believe in Jesus as a personal
          Saviour, and have</p>
