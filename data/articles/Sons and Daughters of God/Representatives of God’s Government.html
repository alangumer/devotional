      <p><strong>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
          forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. <span class="ft36">1 Corinthians
          15:58</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The church of Christ is to be clean, pure, and sanctified unto God. Its members stand before the world as
          representatives of the heavenly government. They are embarked, so long as time shall last, upon an enterprise
          of mercy.</p>
      <p>It is God’s desire that all who profess to believe in the truth of His word shall make it known. Their
          persevering fidelity will be richly rewarded. “The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
          under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High.”</p>
      <p>Let us then not be weary in <nobr>well-doing.</nobr> Let us yield our hearts entirely to the teachings of the
          word of the great Medical Missionary. According to our own faith in the message will be our earnestness and
          our power in promoting the knowledge of Jesus Christ. We are to become “labourers together with God,” always
          “abounding in the work of the Lord.”</p>
      <p>Every day of our lives we face new obligations. The termination of one duty is the beginning of the next. Our
          lives are to be spent in solemn service for the Master. We are the Lord’s servants. The members of Christ’s
          church are to be examples of <nobr>life-service,</nobr> of complete obedience to our great Example. Every day
          our work will be appointed unto us according to our several ability. In prayerful, watchful service, we shall
          perfect characters after the divine simili- tude, characters with which God will be pleased, and that will fit
          us for an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a href="#page_447"><span

      <p>The Lord is waiting to manifest through His people His grace and power.... Individually we are to walk and talk
          with God; then the</p>
      <p>sacred influence of the gospel of Christ in all its preciousness will</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[266]</span><span class="ft34">appear in our lives.</span><a href="#page_447"><span
