    <h1>Dying Thief Accepts Christ as His Saviour, August 31</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest</strong></p>
      <p>into thy kingdom. <span class="ft44">Luke 23:42</span>.</p>
      <p>To the last of His work Christ is a <nobr>sin-pardoner.</nobr> At deepest mid- night, as the Star of Bethlehem
          was about to sink into oblivion, lo there shines amid the moral darkness with distinct brightness the faith of
          a dying sinner as he lays hold upon a dying Saviour.</p>
      <p>Such faith may be represented by the eleventh hour laborers who receive as much reward as do those who have
          labored for many hours. The thief asked in faith, in penitence, in contrition. He asked in earnestness, as if
          he fully realized that Jesus could save him if He would. And the hope in his voice was mingled with anguish as
          he realized, that if He did not, he would be lost, eternally lost. He cast his helpless, dying soul and body
          on Jesus Christ.<a href="#page_445"><span class="ft33">71</span></a></p>
      <p>He had heard Pilate declare, “I find no fault in him.” <span class="ft64">John 19:4</span>. He had marked His
          godlike bearing, and His pitying forgiveness of His tormentors.... Among the <nobr>passers-by</nobr> he hears
          many defending Jesus.</p>
      <p>He hears them repeat His words, and tell of His works. The conviction comes ... to him that this is the
          Christ.... When condemned for his</p>
      <p>crime, the thief had become hopeless and despairing; but strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls to
          mind all he has heard of Jesus.... He has heard the words of those who believed in Jesus</p>
      <p>and followed Him weeping.... The Holy Spirit illuminates his mind,</p>
      <p>and little by little the chain of evidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the
          cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his
          voice as the helpless, dying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour.... Quickly the answer came. Soft and
          melodious the</p>
      <p>tone, full of love, compassion, and power the words: Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in
          Paradise.... To the penitent thief</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[251]</span><span class="ft34">came the perfect peace of acceptance with God.</span><a
