      <p>Can two walk together, except they be agreed? <span class="ft44">Amos 3:3</span>.</p>
      <p>The Lord has not changed.... He is true, merciful, compassionate,</p>
      <p>faithful in the performance of His Word, both in promises and threat- enings. One of the greatest dangers that
          besets the people of God today, is that of association with the ungodly; especially in uniting themselves in
          marriage with unbelievers. With many, the love for the human eclipses the love for the divine. They take the
          first step in backsliding by venturing to disregard the Lord’s express command; and complete apostasy is too
          often the result. It has ever proved a dangerous thing for men to carry out their own will in opposition to
          the requirements of God. Yet it is a hard lesson for men to learn that God means what He says. As a rule,
          those who choose for their friends and companions, persons who reject Christ and trample upon God’s law,
          eventually become of the same mind and spirit.<a href="#page_430"><span class="ft33">14</span></a></p>
      <p>If we would rise to the highest moral excellence, and attain to the perfection of religious character, what
          discrimination should be used in the formation of friendships, and the choice of a companion for life....</p>
      <p>Many who started out in life with as fair and promising a morn- ing, in their limited sphere, as Solomon had in
          his exalted station, through one false and irrevocable step in the marriage relation, lose their souls, and
          draw others down to ruin with them.... Frivolous</p>
      <p>companions, who have no depth of principle, turn away the hearts of those who were once noble and true, to
          vanity, corrupting pleasures, and downright vice.<a href="#page_430"><span class="ft42">15</span></a></p>
      <p>We should ever feel a deep interest in the salvation of the im- penitent, and should manifest toward them a
          spirit of kindness and courtesy; but we can safely choose for our friends only those who are</p>
