    <h1>The Cross Unmasks Satan’s Government, August 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And having spoiled principalities and powers, he [Christ] made a shew of them openly, triumphing over
          them in it. <span class="ft36">Colossians 2:15</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>At the cross of Calvary, love and selfishness stood face to face. Here was their crowning manifestation. Christ
          had lived only to comfort and bless, and in putting Him to death, Satan manifested the malignity of his hatred
          against God. He made it evident that the real purpose of his rebellion was to dethrone God, and to destroy Him
          through whom the love of God was shown.</p>
      <p>By the life and the death of Christ, the thoughts of men also are brought to view. From the manger to the
          cross, the life of Jesus was a call to <nobr>self-surrender,</nobr> and to fellowship in suffering. It
          unveiled the purposes of men. Jesus came with the truth of heaven, and all who were listening to the voice of
          the Holy Spirit were drawn to Him. The worshipers of self belonged to Satan’s kingdom. In their attitude
          toward Christ, all would show on which side they stood. And thus everyone passes judgment on himself.</p>
      <p>In the day of final judgment, every lost soul will understand the nature of his own rejection of truth. The
          cross will be presented, and its real bearing will be seen by every mind that has been blinded by
          transgression. Before the vision of Calvary with its mysterious Victim, sinners will stand condemned. Every
          lying excuse will be swept away. Human apostasy will appear in its heinous character. Men will see what their
          choice has been.... When the thoughts of all</p>
      <p>hearts shall be revealed, both the loyal and the rebellious will unite in declaring, “Just and true are thy
          ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? ... for thy judgments are
          made manifest.”<a href="#page_444"><span class="ft42">54</span></a></p>
      <p>Though earth was struck off from the continent of Heaven and alienated from its communion, Jesus has connected
          it again with the</p>
