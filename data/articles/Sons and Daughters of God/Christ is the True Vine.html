    <h1>Christ is the True Vine, October 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. <span class="ft44">John</span></strong></p>
      <p>15:1<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Those who would follow Christ, must believe in Him; they must open the heart to receive Him as an abiding
          guest. They must abide in Christ, as the branch abides in the living vine. There is a vital union formed
          between the parent stock and the branch, and the same fruit appears upon the branch that is seen upon the
          tree. Thus the Lord will work through the human agent who unites himself to Jesus Christ. Those who have an
          abiding trust in Christ, will, like Enoch, have a sense of the abiding presence of God. Why is it that there
          are so many who feel in uncertainty, who feel that they are <nobr>orphans?—It</nobr> is because they do not
          cultivate faith in the precious assurance that the Lord Jesus is their <nobr>sin-bearer.</nobr> It was in
          behalf of those who had transgressed the law, that Jesus took upon Him human nature, and became like unto us,
          in order that we might have everlasting peace and assurance. We have an advocate in the heavens, and whosoever
          accepts Him as his personal Saviour is not left an orphan to bear the curse of his own sins.</p>
      <p>We must daily cultivate faith, daily contemplate Him who has undertaken our case, who is a merciful and
          faithful high priest; “for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted [not in a few things, but in all
          points like as we are], he is able to succour them that are tempted.” “For we have not an high priest which
          cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.” Even now, in heaven, He is afflicted with our
          afflictions; and as a living Saviour, as an interested Advocate, He is making intercession for us.</p>
      <p>We should daily exercise faith; and that faith should daily increase as it is exercised, as we realize that He
          has not only redeemed us, but has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[288]</span><span class="ft34">made us kings and priests unto God and the Father.</span><a
