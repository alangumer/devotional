    <h1>In Physical Development, May 13</h1>

      <p><strong>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
          <span class="ft45">Luke 2:40</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The physical constitution of Jesus, as well as His spiritual devel- opment, is brought before us in these
          words, “The child grew,” and “increased in stature.” In childhood and youth attention should be given to
          physical development. Parents should so train their children in good habits of eating, drinking, dressing, and
          exercise, that a good foundation will be laid for sound health in after life. The physical organism should
          have special care, that the powers of the body may not be dwarfed, but developed to their full extent. This
          places the chil- dren and youth in a favorable position, so that, with proper religious training, they may,
          like Christ, wax strong in spirit....</p>
      <p>Many claim that it is necessary for the preservation of physical health to indulge in selfish amusement. It is
          true that change is required for the best development of the body, for mind and body are refreshed and
          invigorated by change; but this object is not gained by indulgence in foolish amusements, to the neglect of
          daily duties which the youth should be required to do. The active mind and hands of youth must have
          employment, and if they are not directed to tasks that are useful, that will develop them and bless others,
          they will find employment in that which will work injury to them in both body and mind.<a

      <p>As Jesus worked in childhood and youth, mind and body were developed. He did not use His physical powers
          recklessly, but in such a way as to keep them in health, that He might do the best work in every line.<a
          href="#page_425"><span class="ft42">43</span></a></p>
      <p>His life of natural simplicity was favorable to the development of a good physical constitution, and a firm,
          unsullied character.<a href="#page_425"><span class="ft41">44</span></a></p>
      <p>Physically, as well as spiritually, He was an example of what God</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[141]</span><span class="ft34">designed all humanity to be through obedience to His
          laws.</span><a href="#page_425"><span class="ft35">45</span></a></p>
