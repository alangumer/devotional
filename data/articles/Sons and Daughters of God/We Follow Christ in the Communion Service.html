      <p><strong>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had</strong></p>
      <p>supped, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of
          me. <span class="ft36">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>.</p>
      <p>Christ was standing at the point of transition between two economies and their two great festivals.... As He
          ate the Passover</p>
      <p>with His disciples, He instituted in its place the service that was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice.
          The national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service which Christ established was to be
          observed by His followers in all lands and through all ages....</p>
      <p>Till He shall come the second time in power and glory, this ordinance is to be celebrated.<a

      <p>It is at these, His own appointments, that Christ meets His people, and energizes them by His presence.... All

      <p>But the Communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing. This was not its purpose.... They are not to
          recall the differences be-</p>
      <p>tween them and their brethren. The preparatory service has embraced all this.... Now they come to meet with
          Christ. They are not to stand</p>
      <p>in the shadow of the cross, but in its saving light. They are to open the soul to the bright beams of the Sun
          of Righteousness. With hearts cleansed by Christ’s most precious blood, in full consciousness of His presence,
          although unseen, they are to hear His words, “Peace I leave with you.” ...</p>
      <p>The Communion service points to Christ’s second coming. It was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of
          the disciples.... In</p>
      <p>their tribulation they found comfort in the hope of their Lord’s return. Unspeakably precious to them was the
          thought, “As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he</p>
