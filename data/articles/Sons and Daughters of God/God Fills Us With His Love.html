      <p><strong>New wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</strong></p>
      <p>Luke 5:38<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>We should earnestly seek to know and appreciate the truth, that we may present it to others as it is in Jesus.
          We need to have a correct estimate of the value of our own souls; then we would not be as reckless in regard
          to our course of action as at present. We would seek most earnestly to know God’s way; ... and our constant
          prayer would be that we might have the mind of Christ, that we might be molded and fashioned after His
          likeness. It is in looking to Jesus and beholding His loveliness, having our eyes steadfastly fixed upon Him
          that we become changed into His image....</p>
      <p>The end is near! We have not a moment to lose! Light is to shine forth from God’s people in clear, distinct
          rays, bringing Jesus before the churches and before the world.... The instrumentalities to be</p>
      <p>used are those souls who gladly receive the light of truth which God communicates to them. These are God’s
          agencies for communicating the knowledge of truth to the world. If through the grace of Christ His people will
          become new bottles, He will fill them with the new wine. God will give additional light, and old truths will
          be recovered, and replaced in the <nobr>frame-work</nobr> of truth; and wherever the laborers go, they will
          triumph. As Christ’s ambassadors, they are to search the Scriptures, to seek for the truths that have been
          hidden beneath the rubbish of error. And every ray of light received is to be communicated to others. One
          interest will prevail, one subject will swallow up every <nobr>other,—Christ</nobr> our righteousness....</p>
      <p>“I am the Lord which exercise <nobr>loving-kindness,</nobr> judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in
          these things I delight, saith the Lord.” This is what needs to be brought into ... all our churches. God wants
          every soul to turn to the first love. He wants all to have the gold of faith and love, so that they can draw
          from the treasure to impart to</p>
