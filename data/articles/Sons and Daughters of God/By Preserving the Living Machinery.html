      <p><strong>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and</strong></p>
      <p>be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <span class="ft44">3 John 1:2</span>.</p>
      <p>The right use of one’s self is the most valuable lesson that can be learned. We are not to do brain work, and
          stop there, or make physical exertion, and stop there; we are to make the best use of the various parts that
          compose the human <nobr>machinery,—brain,</nobr> bone, muscle, head, and heart.<a href="#page_431"><span
          class="ft42">40</span></a></p>
      <p>The right use of one’s self includes the whole circle of obligations to one’s self, to the world, and to God.
          Then use the physical powers proportionately with the mental powers. Every action derives its quality from the
          motive which prompts it, and if the motives are not high, and pure, and unselfish, the mind and character will
          never become well balanced....</p>
      <p>You are the Lord’s; for He created you. You are His by redemp- tion; for He gave His life for you.... Preserve
          every portion of the</p>
      <p>living machinery, that you may use it for God. Preserve it for Him. Your health depends upon the right use of
          your physical organism. Do not misuse any portion of your <nobr>God-given</nobr> powers, physical, mental, or
          moral. All your habits are to be brought under the control of a mind that is itself under the control of
          God.</p>
      <p>If young men and women would grow up to the full stature of Christ Jesus, they must treat themselves
          intelligently.... Unhealthful</p>
      <p>habits of every <nobr>order—late</nobr> hours at night, late hours in bed in the morning, rapid
          <nobr>eating—are</nobr> to be overcome. Masticate your food thoroughly. Let there be no hurried eating. Have
          your room well ventilated day and night, and perform useful physical labor.... By</p>
      <p>properly using our powers to their fullest extent in the most useful employment, by keeping every organ in
          health, by so preserving every organ that mind, sinew, and muscle shall work harmoniously, we may</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[172]</span><span class="ft34">do the most precious service for God.</span><a
