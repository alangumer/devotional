      <p><strong>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not. <span class="ft44">1 John 3:6</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>A mere profession of godliness is worthless. It is he that abideth in Christ that is a Christian. For “every
          man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” In every clime, in every nation, our
          youth should cooperate with God. The only way a person can be pure is to become <nobr>like-minded</nobr> with
          God. How can we know <nobr>God?—By</nobr> studying His Word....</p>
      <p>It is through faith in Jesus Christ that the truth is accepted in the heart and the human agent is purified and
          cleansed. Jesus was “wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
          our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.” Is it possible to be healed, while knowingly
          committing <nobr>sin?—No;</nobr> it is genuine faith that says, I know that I have committed sin, but that
          Jesus has pardoned my sin; and hereafter I will resist temptation in and through His might. “Every man that
          hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” He has an abiding principle in the soul, that
          enables him to overcome temptation.</p>
      <p>“Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not.” God has power to keep the soul who is in Christ, when that soul is
          under temptation. “Whoso- ever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.” That is, every one who is a true
          believer is sanctified through the truth, in life and character. “Little children, let no man deceive you: he
          that doeth [not professeth to do] righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.” “Whosoever is born of
          God doth not commit sin; ... because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the
          children of the devil.” Now mark where the distinction is made: “Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of
          God, neither is he that loveth not his brother.” “My little children, let us not love in word, neither in</p>
