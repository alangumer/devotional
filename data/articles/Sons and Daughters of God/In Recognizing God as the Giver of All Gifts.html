    <h1>In Recognizing God as the Giver of All Gifts, May 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the</strong></p>
      <p>God of our salvation. <span class="ft44">Psalm 68:19</span>.</p>
      <p>Under the Jewish economy, on the birth of children an offering was made to God, by His own appointment. Now we
          see parents taking special pains to present gifts to their children upon their birthdays; they make this an
          occasion of honoring the child, as though honor were due to the human being.... For life, health, food, and
          clothing, no</p>
      <p>less than for the hope of eternal life, we are indebted to the Giver of all mercies; and it is due to God to
          recognize His gifts, and to present our offerings of gratitude to our greatest benefactor. These birthday
          gifts are recognized in heaven.</p>
      <p>If Christian parents had accustomed their children to present of- ferings to God in acknowledgment of His great
          gift of salvation to men, how different would be the character of the young. Their minds would have been
          called away from themselves to the blessed Saviour. They would have been taught to feel that He loved them,
          and that He is the source of all blessing; that He is their hope of happiness and eternal life.</p>
      <p>If this kind of education had been given to our children, we should today see far less selfishness, far less
          envy and jealousy; we should have more manly young men and womanly young women. We should see the youth coming
          up with moral strength, with pure principles, with <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> minds and lovely characters,
          because the Model would be ever before them; they would be impressed with the impor- tance of copying the
          excellence of Jesus, the Pattern.... God wants</p>
      <p>the youth and those of mature age to look to Him, to believe in Jesus Christ whom He has sent, and to have Him
          abiding in the heart; then a new life will quicken every faculty of the being. The divine Comforter will be
          with them, to strengthen them in their weakness, and guide</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[153]</span><span class="ft34">them in their perplexity.... It will make plain to them the
          path of life.</span><a href="#page_427"><span class="ft35">71</span></a></p>
