    <h1>In Communion With God, May 9</h1>

      <p><strong>And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the
          evening was come, he was there alone. <span class="ft36">Matthew 14:23</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The strength of Christ was in prayer.... Christ retired to the groves</p>
      <p>or mountains with the world and everything else shut out. He was alone with His Father. With intense
          earnestness, He poured out His supplications, and put forth all the strength of His soul in grasping the hand
          of the Infinite. When new and great trials were before Him, He would steal away to the solitude of the
          mountains, and pass the entire night in prayer to His heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>As Christ is our example in all things, if we imitate His example in earnest, importunate prayer to God that we
          may have strength in His name who never yielded to the temptations of Satan to resist the devices of the wily
          foe, we shall not be overcome by him.<a href="#page_424"><span class="ft32">28</span></a></p>
      <p>Amid the perils of these last days, the only safety of the youth lies in <nobr>ever-increasing</nobr>
          watchfulness and prayer. The youth who finds his joy in reading the Word of God, and in the hour of prayer,
          will be constantly refreshed by drafts from the fountain of life. He will attain a height of moral excellence
          and a breadth of thought of which others cannot conceive. Communion with God encourages good thoughts, noble
          aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, and lofty purposes of ac- tion. Those who thus connect themselves
          with God are acknowledged by Him as His sons and daughters. They are constantly reaching higher and still
          higher, obtaining clearer views of God and of eter- nity, until the Lord makes them channels of light and
          wisdom to the world.... The strength acquired in prayer to God will prepare us for</p>
      <p>our daily duties.<a href="#page_424"><span class="ft35">29</span></a></p>
      <p>There is a mighty power in prayer. Our great adversary is con- stantly seeking to keep the troubled soul away
          from God. An appeal to Heaven by the humblest saint is more to be dreaded by Satan than</p>
