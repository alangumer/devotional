      <p><strong>Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the</strong></p>
      <p>heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. <span class="ft44">Psalm 46:10</span>.</p>
      <p>Christians should ... cultivate a love for meditation, and cherish a spirit of devotion. Many seem to begrudge
          moments spent in medi- tation, and the searching of the Scriptures, and prayer, as though the time thus
          occupied was lost. I wish you could all view these things in the light God would have you; for you would then
          make the kingdom of Heaven of the first importance. To keep your heart in Heaven, will give vigor to all your
          graces, and put life into all your duties. To discipline the mind to dwell upon heavenly things, will put life
          and earnestness into all our endeavors.<a href="#page_419"><span class="ft33">30</span></a></p>
      <p>Let every one who desires to be a partaker of the divine nature appreciate the fact that he must escape the
          corruption that is in the world through lust. There must be a constant, earnest struggling of the soul against
          the evil imaginings of the mind. There must be a steadfast resistance of temptation to sin in thought or act.
          The soul must be kept from every stain, through faith in Him who is able to keep you from falling. We should
          meditate upon the Scriptures, thinking soberly and candidly upon the things that pertain to our eternal
          salvation. The infinite mercy and love of Jesus, the sacrifice made in our behalf, call for most serious and
          solemn reflection. We should dwell upon the character of our dear Redeemer and Intercessor. We should seek to
          comprehend the meaning of the plan of salvation. We should meditate upon the mission of Him who came to save
          His people from their sins. By constantly contemplating heavenly themes, our faith and love will grow
          stronger. Our prayers will be more and more acceptable to God, because they will be more and more mixed with
          faith and love. They</p>
