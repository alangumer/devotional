    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and <nobr>joint-heirs</nobr> with Christ; if so be that we
          suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. <span class="ft36">Romans 8:17</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>All who enter into a covenant with Jesus Christ become by adop- tion the children of God. They are cleansed by
          the regenerating power of the Word, and angels are commissioned to minister unto them. They are baptized in
          the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. They pledge themselves to become active members of
          His church in the earth. They are to be dead to all the allurements of worldly desires; but in conversation
          and godliness, they are, through sanctification of the Spirit to exert a living influence for God.</p>
      <p>“Heirs of God, and <nobr>joint-heirs</nobr> with <nobr>Christ,”—what</nobr> an exalted, dignified position!
          Separate and distinct from the world, secure from the wily snares of Satan! By their baptismal vows, God’s
          professed followers have pledged themselves to stand in opposition to evil. The enemy of souls will work with
          all craft to corrupt their minds. He will seek to introduce his methods into their service for the Master. But
          there is safety for them if they will heed the injunction: “... be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
          might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”<a

      <p>Man is honored by being made a <nobr>co-partner</nobr> in God’s firm, by being accepted as a worker in the
          great centers He has established....</p>
      <p>By appointment, the Lord our Redeemer is heir of God, and those who are <nobr>co-laborers</nobr> with Him in
          the work of saving souls, are joint heirs with Him.... To be an overcomer is to be placed in the ranks of</p>
      <p>those who have the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.<a href="#page_402"><span
