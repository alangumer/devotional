    <h1>That God Created Man in His Own Image, January 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
          <span class="ft30">Genesis 1:27</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>All heaven took a deep and joyful interest in the creation of the world and of man. Human beings were a new and
          distinct order. They were made “in the image of God,” and it was the Creator’s design that they should
          populate the earth. They were to live in close communion with heaven, receiving power from the Source of all
          power. Upheld by God, they were to live sinless lives.<a href="#page_401"><span class="ft32">1</span></a></p>
      <p>The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care of God, but students receiving instruction from
          the <nobr>all-wise</nobr> Creator. They were visited by angels, and were granted communion with their Maker,
          with no obscuring veil between.... The mysteries of</p>
      <p>the visible <nobr>universe—“the</nobr> wondrous works of him who is perfect in <nobr>knowledge”—afforded</nobr>
          them an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. The laws and operations of nature, which have engaged
          men’s study for six thousand years, were opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and Upholder of all.
          They held converse with leaf and flower and tree, gathering from each the secrets of its life. With every
          living creature, from the mighty leviathan that playeth among the waters, to the insect mote that floats in
          the sunbeam, Adam was familiar. He had given to each its name, and he was acquainted with the nature and
          habits of all. God’s glory in the heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, “the
          balancings of the clouds,” the mysteries of light and sound, of day and <nobr>night,—all</nobr> were open to
          the study of our first parents.<a href="#page_401"><span class="ft33">2</span></a></p>
      <p>God created man a superior being; he alone is formed in the image of God, and is capable of partaking of the
          divine nature, of</p>
