    <h1>Be Sober and Watch Unto Prayer, December 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and</strong></p>
      <p>watch unto prayer. <span class="ft44">1 Peter 4:7</span>.</p>
      <p>The admonition to the Israel of today is, “The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch
          unto prayer.” “Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good
          works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he
          that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. Exhort servants to be
          obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; not purloining,
          but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.” Resist the
          enemy; do not be seduced by his flattering inducements and presentations. It is the work of the human agent to
          be strong, not in his own finite strength, but in the strength of the Lord, in the power of His might....</p>
      <p>Christ has said, “Without me ye can do nothing.” The resolutions you may make in your own finite strength, will
          be only as ropes of sand; but if you pray in sincerity, surrendering yourself, soul, body, and spirit, unto
          God, you put on the whole armor of God, and open the soul to the righteousness of Christ; and this
          <nobr>alone,—Christ’s</nobr> imputed <nobr>righteousness,—makes</nobr> you able to stand against the wiles of
          the devil. The work of every soul is to resist the enemy in the power and might of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
          the promise is that the devil shall flee from us. But let all realize that they are in peril, and there is no
          assurance of safety except as they comply with the conditions of the text. The Lord says, “Draw nigh to God.”
          <nobr>How?—By</nobr> secret, earnest examination of your own heart; by childlike, <nobr>heart-felt,</nobr>
          humble dependence upon God, making known your weakness to Jesus; and by confessing your</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[347]</span><span class="ft34">sins. Thus you may draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to
          you.</span><a href="#page_460"><span class="ft35">7</span></a></p>
