    <h1>To Trust Him, July 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in</strong></p>
      <p>the Lord shall be safe. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 29:25</span>.</p>
      <p>The Lord desires you to be of good courage. Brace up.... Satan is</p>
      <p>working on every hand to destroy faith, and to make people unhappy.<a href="#page_435"><span
          class="ft49">8</span></a>If you are not experienced in discerning the devices of Satan, your only safety is in
          prayer. Lay open all the secrets of the heart to the search of the infinite eye, and plead with God to make
          you pure and strong, and to arm you completely for the great conflicts of life. Faith grows by conflicts with
          doubts; virtue gathers strength by the</p>
      <p>resistance of temptation.<a href="#page_435"><span class="ft35">9</span></a></p>
      <p>All blessings are bestowed upon those who have a vital connection with Jesus Christ. Jesus calls them to
          Himself not simply to refresh us with His grace and presence for a few hours, and then to send us forth from
          His light to walk apart from Him in sadness and gloom. No, no. He tells us that we must abide with Him and He
          with us. Wherever His work is to be done, He is present, tender, loving, and compassionate. He has prepared
          for you and me an abiding dwelling place in Himself. He is our refuge. Our experience should broaden and
          deepen. Jesus has opened up all the divine fullness of His inexpressible love.... Talk</p>
      <p>courage, talk faith, talk hope. My brother and sister in the Lord, be of good courage. O, how little we know
          what is before us! We will give ourselves entirely to Jesus, to be wholly His, and then say, “Not my will, but
          thy will, O God, be done.” ... You have the tender love and compassion of your Saviour. Look to Him always.
          Trust in Him continually, and doubt not His love. He knows all our weakness and that which we need. He will
          give us grace sufficient for our day. Only look to Jesus continually, and be of good courage.<a
