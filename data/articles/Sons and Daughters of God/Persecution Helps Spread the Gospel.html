    <h1>Persecution Helps Spread the Gospel, September 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for
          Christ’s sake. <span class="ft30">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>In every age God’s chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted; yet through their affliction, the
          knowledge of God has been spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to step into the ranks, and carry forward
          the same work, knowing that its foes can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. God means that truth
          shall be brought to the front, and become the subject of examination and discussion, even through the contempt
          placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach, every effort to
          restrict liberty of conscience, is God’s means of awakening minds that otherwise might slumber.</p>
      <p>How often this result has been seen in the history of God’s mes- sengers! When the noble and eloquent Stephen
          was stoned to death at the instigation of the Sanhedrin council, there was no loss to the cause of the gospel.
          The light of heaven that glorified his face, the divine compassion breathed in his dying prayer, were as a
          sharp arrow of conviction to the bigoted Sanhedrist who stood by, and Saul, the persecuting Pharisee, became a
          chosen vessel, to bear the name of Christ before Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. And long
          afterward Paul the aged wrote from his <nobr>prison-house</nobr> at Rome: “Some indeed preach Christ even of
          envy and strife, ... not sincerely, sup- posing to add affliction to my bonds.... Notwithstanding, every
          way,</p>
      <p>whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached.” Through Paul’s imprisonment the gospel was spread abroad,
          and souls were won for Christ in the very palace of the Caesars. By the efforts of Satan to destroy it, “the
          incorruptible seed” of the Word of God, “which liveth and abideth forever,” is sown in the hearts of men;
          through the reproach and persecution of His children, the name of Christ is</p>
