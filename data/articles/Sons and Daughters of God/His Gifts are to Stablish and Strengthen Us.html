    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the Lord of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye
          have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. <span class="ft36">1 Peter
          5:10</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Blessed is the soul who can say, “I am guilty before God: but Jesus is my Advocate. I have transgressed His
          law. I cannot save myself; but I make the precious blood that was shed on Calvary all my plea. I am lost in
          Adam, but restored in Christ. God, who so loved the world as to give His only begotten Son to die, will not
          leave me to perish while repentant and in contrition of soul. He will not look upon me, for I am all unworthy;
          but He will look upon the face of His Anointed, He will look upon my Substitute and Surety, and listen to the
          plea of my Advocate, who died for my sin, that I might be made the righteousness of God in Him. By beholding
          Him I shall be changed into His image. I cannot change my own character, save by partaking of the grace of Him
          who is all goodness, righteousness, mercy, and truth. But by beholding Him, I shall catch His spirit, and be
          transformed into His likeness....” The heart that is filled with the</p>
      <p>grace of Christ will be made manifest by its peace and joy; and where Christ abides, the character will become
          purified, elevated, ennobled, and glorified.<a href="#page_421"><span class="ft41">55</span></a></p>
      <p>The Creator of all worlds proposes to love those who believe in His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son as their
          personal Saviour, even as He loves His Son. Even here and now His gracious favor is bestowed upon us to this
          marvelous extent. He has given to men the gift of the Light and Majesty of heaven, and with Him He has
          bestowed all the treasures of heaven. Much as He has promised us for the life to come, He also bestows
          princely gifts upon us in this life, and as subjects of His grace, He would have us enjoy everything that will
          ennoble, expand, and elevate our characters.<a href="#page_421"><span class="ft33">56</span></a></p>
      <p>The Lord has in readiness the most precious exhibitions of His</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[121]</span><span class="ft34">grace to strengthen and encourage.</span><a
