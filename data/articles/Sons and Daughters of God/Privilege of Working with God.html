    <h1>Privilege of Working with God, September 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building. <span
          class="ft45">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>If you could only realize that the God of heaven takes those who have been rebels against His government, and
          says to them, You may be laborers together with Me, you would this day consecrate yourselves wholly to Him....
          Is it not wonderful that we can receive</p>
      <p>the rich current of grace from the Deity, and work in harmony with Him? What does the Deity want with
          <nobr>us—poor,</nobr> weak, and feeble as we are? What can He do with <nobr>us?—Everything,</nobr> if we are
          willing to surrender all.<a href="#page_445"><span class="ft42">1</span></a></p>
      <p>When God called me in my very childhood to work for Him, I used to think, What can I do? God says, Do My
          bidding. This is all that any of us need do. I want to tell you what each of you, from the oldest to the
          youngest, can do: You can <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with God, ... and with one another.... You will not study
          how to please yourself. You</p>
      <p>will realize that you are responsible for the influence you exert....</p>
      <p>“We are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry.” Think of it! He is seeking to work the mind, just
          as you work the land. He is trying to sow seed that will bear fruit to His glory. “Ye are God’s building.” But
          He does not build without any care for you.<a href="#page_445"><span class="ft33">2</span></a>If we surrender
          our lives to His service, we can never be placed in</p>
      <p>a position for which God has not made provision.<a href="#page_445"><span class="ft35">3</span></a></p>
      <p>Jesus has opened up all the divine fullness of His inexpressible</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[252]</span><span class="ft34">love, and He declares to you, “Ye are laborers together with
          God.”</span><a href="#page_445"><span class="ft35">4</span></a></p>
