      <p>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,</p>
      <p>then an heir of God through Christ. <span class="ft44">Galatians 4:7</span>.</p>
      <p>The Galatians were given up to the worship of idols, but as the apostles preached to them, they rejoiced in the
          message that promised freedom from the thraldom of sin. Paul and his <nobr>fellow-workers</nobr> pro- claimed
          the doctrine of righteousness by faith in the atoning sacrifice of Christ. They presented Christ as the One
          who, seeing the helpless condition of the fallen race, came to redeem men and women by living a life of
          obedience to God’s law, and by paying the penalty of disobedience. And in the light of the cross, many who had
          never before known of the true God, began to comprehend the greatness of the Father’s love. Thus the Galatians
          were taught the fundamental truths concerning “God the Father,” and “our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself
          for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
          Father.” “By the hearing of faith,” they received the Spirit of God, and became “the children of God by faith
          in Christ.”</p>
      <p>Paul’s manner of life while among the Galatians was such that he could afterward say, “I beseech you, be as I
          am.” His lips had been touched with a live coal from off the altar, and he was enabled to rise above bodily
          infirmities, and to present Jesus as the sinner’s only hope. Those who heard him knew that he had been with
          Jesus. Endued with power from on high, he was able to compare spiritual things with spiritual, and to tear
          down the strongholds of Satan. Hearts were broken by this presentation of the love of God, as revealed in the
          sacrifice of His only begotten Son, and many were led to inquire, What must I do to be saved? ... The cross
          brings us near to God, reconciling us to Him. With the relenting compassion of a father’s love, Jehovah looks
          upon the suffering that His Son endured in order</p>
