      <p>Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler
          over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. <span class="ft36">Matthew 25:21</span>.</p>
      <p>The Lord is willing to do great things for us. We shall not gain the victory through numbers, but through the
          full surrender of the soul to Jesus. We are to go forward in His strength, trusting in the mighty God of
          Israel.... It is essential to have an intelligent knowledge</p>
      <p>of the truth; for how else could we meet its wily opponents? The Bible must be studied, not alone for the
          doctrines it teaches, but for its practical lessons. You should never be surprised, you should never be
          without your armor on. Be prepared for any emergency, for any call of duty. Be waiting, watching for every
          opportunity to present the truth, familiar with the prophecies, familiar with the lessons of Christ. But do
          not trust in <nobr>well-prepared</nobr> arguments. Argument alone is not enough. God must be sought on your
          knees; you must go forth to meet the people through the power and influence of His Spirit....</p>
      <p>God would have you minute men, as were the men who composed Gideon’s army.<a href="#page_450"><span

      <p>When in the day of final awards, the reward is given to each as his works have been, it is your privilege to
          have redeemed souls whom you have been the means of helping, come to you and say, “You lifted me out of
          discouragement.” And the Master will say to you, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”<a

      <p>The Lord keeps a complete list of His workers, and in Bible history He has given us the names of a few. Among
          those who were faithful stewards are Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Elijah, Daniel, Nehemiah, John, and Paul.... The
          workers in the vineyard of the Lord have</p>
      <p>the example of the good of all ages to stimulate them. They have to encourage them the love of God, the
          ministration of angels, the sympathy of Jesus, and the hope of winning precious souls to shine</p>
