      <p>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
          sins. <span class="ft45">1 John 4:10</span>.</p>
      <p>In redemption God has revealed His love in sacrifice, a sacrifice so broad and deep and high that it is
          immeasurable. “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son....”</p>
      <p>When Adam’s sin plunged the race into hopeless misery, God might have cut Himself loose from fallen beings. He
          might have treated them as sinners deserved to be treated. He might have com- manded the angels of heaven to
          pour out upon our world the vials of His wrath. He might have removed this dark blot from His universe. But He
          did not do this. Instead of banishing them from His presence, He came still nearer to the fallen race. He gave
          His Son to become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, ...
          full of grace and truth.” Christ by His human relationship to men drew them close to God. He clothed His
          divine nature with the garb of humanity, and demonstrated before the heav- enly universe, before the unfallen
          worlds, how much God loves the children of men.</p>
      <p>The gift of God to man is beyond all computation. Nothing was withheld. God would not permit it to be said that
          He could have done more or revealed to humanity a greater measure of love. In the gift of Christ He gave all
          heaven.</p>
      <p>The Highest, who was with the Father before the world was, submitted to humiliation, that He might uplift
          humanity. Prophecy withdraws the veil, that we may behold the throne of heaven, that we may see upon that
          throne, high and lifted up, One who in human form, came to our world to suffer, to be lacerated with stripes,
          and bruised for our iniquities.<a href="#page_402"><span class="ft41">17</span></a></p>
      <p>Thus God showed His love for man. With Christ He gave all heaven, that the moral image of God might be restored
          in man.... His</p>
