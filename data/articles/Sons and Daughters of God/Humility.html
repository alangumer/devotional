    <h1>Humility, March 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the</strong></p>
      <p>proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. <span class="ft44">James 4:6</span>.</p>
      <p>You are safe only as, in perfect submission and obedience, you connect yourselves with Christ. The yoke is
          easy, for Christ carries the weight. As you lift the burden of the cross, it will become light; and that cross
          is to you a pledge of eternal life. It is the privilege of each to follow gladly after Christ, exclaiming at
          every step, “Thy gentleness hath made me great.” But if we would travel heavenward, we must take the Word of
          God as our <nobr>lesson-book.</nobr> In the words of inspiration we must read our lessons day by day....</p>
      <p>The humiliation of the man Christ Jesus is incomprehensible to the human mind; but His divinity and His
          existence before the world was formed can never be doubted by those who believe the Word of God. The apostle
          Paul speaks of our Mediator, the only begotten Son of God, who in a state of glory was in the form of God, the
          Commander of all the heavenly hosts, and who, when He clothed His divinity with humanity, took upon Him the
          form of a servant....</p>
      <p>In consenting to become man, Christ manifested a humility that is the marvel of the heavenly intelligences. The
          act of consenting to be a man would be no humiliation were it not for the fact of Christ’s exalted
          <nobr>pre-existence.</nobr> We must open our understanding to realize that Christ laid aside His royal robe,
          His kingly crown, His high command, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might meet man where he
          was, and bring to the human family moral power to become the sons and daughters of God. To redeem man, Christ
          became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a href="#page_415"><span

      <p>The meekness and humility that characterized the life of Christ will be made manifest in the life and character
          of those who “walk</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[82]</span><span class="ft34">even as he walked.”</span><a href="#page_415"><span
