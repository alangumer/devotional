    <h1>We are to Overcome as Christ Overcame, May 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have
          tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. <span class="ft36">John
          16:33</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan made stronger attacks upon Christ than he will ever make upon us. There was much at stake with him,
          whether Christ or himself should be conqueror. If Christ resisted his most powerful temptations, and Satan did
          not succeed in leading Him to sin, he knew that he must lose his power, and finally be punished with
          everlasting destruction. Therefore Satan worked with mighty power to lead Christ to do a wrong action, for
          then he would gain advantage over Him.... You</p>
      <p>can never be tempted in so determined and cruel manner as was our Saviour. Satan was upon His path every
          moment.<a href="#page_428"><span class="ft41">84</span></a></p>
      <p>Will man take hold of divine power, and with determination and perseverance resist Satan, as Christ has given
          him example in His conflict with the foe in the wilderness of temptation? God cannot save man against his will
          from the power of Satan’s artifices. Man must work with his human power, aided by the divine power of Christ,
          to resist and to conquer at any cost to himself. In short, man must overcome as Christ overcame. And then,
          through the victory that it is his privilege to gain by the <nobr>all-powerful</nobr> name of Jesus, he may
          become an heir of God and <nobr>joint-heir</nobr> with Jesus Christ. This could not be the case if Christ
          alone did all the overcoming. Man must do his part; he must be victor on his own account, through the strength
          and grace that Christ gives him. Man must be a <nobr>co-worker</nobr> with Christ in the labor of overcoming,
          and then he will be partaker with Christ in His glory.<a href="#page_428"><span

      <p>The Saviour overcame to show man how he may overcome. All the temptations of Satan, Christ met with the Word of
          God. By trusting in God’s promises, He received power to obey God’s commandments,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[157]</span><span class="ft34">and the tempter could gain no advantage.</span><a
