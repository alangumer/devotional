    <h1>Mind Increases Strength by Continual Effort, April 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth</strong></p>
      <p><span class="ft11">strength.</span>Proverbs 24:5<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Put your highest power into your effort. Call to your aid the most powerful motives. You are learning. Endeavor
          to go to the bottom of everything you set your hand to. Never aim lower than to become competent in the
          matters which occupy you. Do not allow yourself to fall into the habit of being superficial and neglectful in
          your duties and studies; for your habits will strengthen and you will become incapable of anything better. The
          mind naturally learns to be satisfied with that which requires little care and effort, and to be content with
          something cheap and inferior. There are, young men and young women, depths of knowledge which you have never
          fathomed, and you are satisfied and proud of your superficial attainments. If you knew much more than you do
          now, you would be convinced that you know very little.</p>
      <p>God demands of you vigorous and earnest intellectual efforts, and with every determined effort, your powers
          will strengthen. Your work will then always be agreeable, because you will know that you are progressing. You
          can either become accustomed to slow, uncertain, irresolute movements, so much so that the work of your life
          will not be <nobr>one-half</nobr> what it could be; or, your eyes fixed upon God, and your soul strengthened
          by prayer, you can overcome a disgraceful slowness and a dislike for work, and train your mind to think
          rapidly and to put forth strong efforts at the proper time.<a href="#page_419"><span

      <p>God has given the human mind great power, power to show that the Creator has endowed man with ability to do a
          great work against the enemy of all righteousness, power to show what victories may be gained in the conflict
          against evil. To those who fulfill God’s purpose for them will be spoken the words, “Well done, good and
          faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[107]</span><span class="ft34">ruler over many things.”</span><a href="#page_419"><span
