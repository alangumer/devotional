      <p>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
          <span class="ft36">Exodus 20:12</span>.</p>
      <p>Those who would truly follow Christ must let Him abide in the heart, and enthrone Him there as supreme. They
          must represent His spirit and character in their home life, and show courtesy and kindness to those with whom
          they come in contact. There are many children who profess to know the truth, who do not render to their
          parents the honor and affection that are due to them, who manifest but little love to father and mother, and
          fail to honor them in deferring to their wishes, or in seeking to relieve them of anxiety. Many who profess to
          be Christians do not know what it means to “honour thy father and thy mother,” and consequently will know just
          as little what it means, “that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” ... The
          <nobr>Heart-searcher</nobr> knows what is your attitude toward your parents; for He is weighing moral
          character in the golden scales of the heavenly sanctuary. O, confess your neglect of your parents, confess
          your indifference toward them, and your contempt of God’s holy commandment.<a href="#page_411"><span

      <p>Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due to no other person. God Himself, who has
          placed upon them a responsi- bility for the souls committed to their charge, has ordained that during the
          earlier years of life, parents shall stand in the place of God to their children. And he who rejects the
          rightful authority of his parents, is rejecting the authority of God. The fifth commandment requires the
          children not only to yield respect, submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and
          tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and comfort them in old age.<a

      <p>The fifth commandment is binding upon children as long as their</p>
