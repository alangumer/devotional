    <h1>We Hasten His Return With Holy Conversation,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>December 11</strong></p>
      <p>What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the
          coming of the day of God? <span class="ft36">2 Peter 3:11, 12</span>.</p>
      <p>Many who profess to be looking for the speedy coming of Christ, are becoming conformed to this world, and seek
          more earnestly for the applause of those around them, than the approbation of God....</p>
      <p>Many of these professed Christians dress, talk and act like the world, and the only thing by which they may be
          known, is their profes- sion. Though they profess to be looking for Christ, their conversation is not in
          heaven, but on worldly things.</p>

          complain, when Jesus bore the scoffs and derision of His own people? ... No, I will not complain; I will
          rather rejoice and be exceeding glad that I am accounted worthy to suffer for Christ’s sake, that my reward
          may be in heaven. Only let me have an inheritance in glory, and it will be enough....</p>
      <p>Let us strive to be Christians <nobr>(Christ-like)</nobr> in every sense of the word, and let our dress,
          conversation and actions preach that Christ is formed within, the hope of glory, and that we are looking for
          that blessed hope and glorious appearing of Jesus.... My affections,</p>
