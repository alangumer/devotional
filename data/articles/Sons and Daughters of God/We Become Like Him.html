      <p><strong>Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my
          glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. <span
          class="ft36">John 17:24</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>In our work we meet with many discouragements. But we shall not gain a particle of strength by dwelling on the
          discouragements. By beholding we become changed. As we look in faith to Jesus, His image is engraven on the
          heart. We are transformed in character.<a href="#page_459"><span class="ft32">64</span></a></p>
      <p>There are many who, in dwelling too largely upon theory, have lost sight of the living power of the Saviour’s
          example. They have lost sight of Him as the humble, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> worker. What they need is to
          behold Jesus. Daily we need the fresh revealing of His presence.<a href="#page_459"><span
          class="ft43">65</span></a>As we discern the perfection of our Saviour’s character, we shall desire to become
          wholly transformed, and renewed in the image of His purity. The more we know of God, the higher will be our
          ideal of character, and the more earnest our longing to reflect His likeness. A divine element combines with
          the human when the soul reaches out</p>
      <p>after God.<a href="#page_459"><span class="ft35">66</span></a></p>
      <p>As one becomes acquainted with the history of the Redeemer he discovers in himself serious defects.... He
          catches the looks, the spirit,</p>
      <p>of his beloved Master.... It is not by looking away from Him that we</p>
      <p>imitate the life of Jesus, but by talking of Him, by dwelling upon His perfections, by seeking to refine the
          taste and elevate the character, by trying, through faith and love, and by earnest, persevering effort, to
          approach the perfect Pattern. By having a knowledge of Christ,— His words, His habits, and His lessons of
          <nobr>instructions,—we</nobr> borrow the virtues of the character we have so closely studied, and become
          imbued with the spirit we have so much admired. Jesus becomes to</p>
      <p>us “the chiefest among ten thousand,” the One “altogether lovely.”<a href="#page_459"><span
