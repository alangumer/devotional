      <p>And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for
          I have found my sheep which was lost. <span class="ft36">Luke 15:6</span>.</p>
      <p>When Jesus spoke these words, He was talking to a company, many of whom knew by experience what a shepherd’s
          life is in Pales- tine. There the flocks are not kept in level, inclosed pastures, but on the
          <nobr>hill-sides,</nobr> among crags and precipices....</p>
      <p>There was always the danger from robbers and wolves to be guarded against. Sometimes a sheep would stray away
          from the flock; so they were frequently numbered to see that none were lost, for the shepherd must give a
          strict account of all the sheep under his care....</p>
      <p>The shepherd’s life is one full of peril. If he is a trustworthy shepherd, he will not be careless and study
          his own ease, but he will search for the straying sheep amid storm and tempest....</p>
      <p>This is the way the true Shepherd treats the lost sinner. He goes after him; He does not hesitate at peril,
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacrifice.</nobr> He is intent upon bringing the
          <nobr>sin-burdened</nobr> soul to repentance, to salvation, to peace, rest, and happiness in his Saviour’s
          love. And it is the privilege of every one who has experienced the love of Jesus in his own heart, to think if
          there is not some one whom he can by personal effort, by studied tact and kindness, bring to Jesus, who is
          ready and willing to accept all who will come to Him. We can all do much through personal effort. We can be
          laborers with Jesus Christ.<a href="#page_450"><span class="ft43">65</span></a></p>
      <p>Life is serious. You have a large field in which to work; and persevering search for the lost sheep will be the
          most successful way in which you can employ your time.... If you can exert a saving</p>
      <p>influence over one soul, remember there is joy in heaven over the one that repented.... You may, by judicious
          effort, be the means of</p>
