      <p><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
          image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <span class="ft36">2 Corinthians
          3:18</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>When enlightened by the Spirit of God, the believer beholds the perfection of Jesus, and beholding this
          perfection, he rejoices with joy unspeakable. In self he sees sin and helplessness; in the Redeemer
          sinlessness and infinite power. The sacrifice that Christ made in order that He might impart to us His
          <nobr>righteousnessâ€”this</nobr> is a theme upon which we may dwell with deeper and still deeper enthusiasm.
          Self is nothing; Jesus is everything....</p>
      <p>The transforming power of grace can make me a partaker of the divine nature. On Christ the glory of God has
          shone, and by looking upon Christ, contemplating His <nobr>self-sacrifice,</nobr> remembering that in Him
          dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, the believer is drawn closer and closer to the Source of
          power....</p>
      <p>How essential that we have the enlightenment of the Spirit of God; for thus only can we see the glory of
          Christ, and by beholding become changed from character to character in and through faith in Christ....</p>
      <p>He has grace and pardon for every soul. As by faith we look to Jesus, our faith pierces the shadow, and we
          adore God for His wondrous love in giving us Jesus the Comforter....</p>
      <p>The sinner may become a child of God, an heir of heaven. He may rise from the dust, and stand forth arrayed in
          garments of light....</p>
      <p>At every step of advance, he sees new beauties in Christ, and becomes more like Him in character.<a

      <p>The love that was manifested toward him in the death of Christ, awakens a response of thankful love, and in
          answer to sincere prayer, the believer is brought from grace to grace, from glory to glory, until</p>
