    <h1>The Mind Must Be Fed With Pure Food, April 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put</strong></p>
      <p>their trust in him. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 30:5</span>.</p>
      <p>There are many who are easily amused with story books. The mind is filled with a cheap kind of food for
          meditation, so that it becomes powerless to search and comprehend the very things which concern eternal
          interests. The Lord enjoins upon children and youth to search for truth as for hidden treasure, and to be
          attracted and fascinated by that which unites the human with the divine.<a href="#page_419"><span

      <p>The mind must be fed with pure food if the heart be pure.... The</p>
      <p>Bible is the standard for the young who would be loyal to the King of heaven. “Thy word have I hid in mine
          heart, that I might not sin against thee.”<a href="#page_419"><span class="ft42">26</span></a></p>
      <p>It is impossible for the youth to possess a healthy tone of mind, and correct religious principles, unless they
          enjoy the perusal of the Word of God. This book contains the most interesting history, points out the way of
          salvation through Christ, and is their guide to a higher, and better life.<a href="#page_419"><span
          class="ft42">27</span></a></p>
      <p>The Bible gives the true seeker an advanced mental discipline, and he comes from contemplation of divine things
          with his facul- ties enriched; self is humbled, while God and His revealed truth are exalted.... The Bible
          contains just that quality of food that the Chris-</p>
      <p>tian needs, in order that he may grow strong in spirit and intellect....</p>
      <p>Through the study of the Bible, converse is held with patriarchs and prophets. The truth is clothed in elevated
          language, which exerts a fascinating power over the mind; the thought is lifted up from the things of earth,
          and brought to contemplate the glory of the future immortal life.<a href="#page_419"><span

      <p>Let the thought, the aptitude, the keen exercise of brain power, be</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[109]</span><span class="ft34">given to the study of the thoughts of God.</span><a
