    <h1>To Study the Scriptures, July 2</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience
          and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. <span class="ft36">Romans 15:4</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>This Holy Book has withstood the assaults of Satan, who has united with evil men to make everything of divine
          character shrouded in clouds and darkness. But the Lord has preserved this Holy Book by His own miraculous
          power in its present <nobr>shape,—a</nobr> chart or guidebook to the human family to show them the way to
          heaven.... This Word ...</p>
      <p>is the guidebook to the inhabitants of a fallen world, bequeathed to them, that by studying and obeying the

          temptation comes upon them, they seem to be off guard, and ignorant of the devices of the enemy. We are living
          in perilous times, and as we draw near the close of earth’s history, there will be no safety for those who do
          not become familiar with the Word of God.... Everything that can be shaken, will be shaken.... The
          children</p>
      <p>of God have reached the most critical part of their pilgrimage; for the nets and pitfalls of the enemy are on
          every side. And yet with the guidance of the Lord, with that which is plainly revealed in His Word, we may
