    <h1>Changes Our Constant Complaining to Praise, April</h1>

      <p>Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his</p>
      <p>wonderful works to the children of men! <span class="ft44">Psalm 107:8</span>.</p>
      <p>We are <nobr>heaven-bound,</nobr> and we should show the attractive part of our faith. We should not go as a
          crippled band of mourners, groaning and complaining all along the journey to our Father’s house.<a

      <p>Those professed Christians who are constantly complaining, who seem to think happiness and a cheerful
          countenance a sin, have not the genuine attributes of religion. Those who look upon nature’s beautiful scenery
          as they would upon a dead picture; who choose to look upon dead leaves rather than to gather the beautiful
          flowers; who take a mournful pleasure in all that is melancholy in the language spoken to them by the natural
          world; who see no beauty in valleys clothed in living green, and grand mountain heights clothed with verdure;
          who close their senses to the joyful voice that speaks to them in nature,</p>
      <p><nobr>...—these</nobr> are not in Christ.<a href="#page_421"><span class="ft35">49</span></a></p>
      <p>Suppose we change this order of things.... Suppose you try to</p>
      <p>count all your blessings. You have thought so little upon them, and they have been so continual, that when
          reverses or afflictions come, you are grieved, and think God is unjust. You do not call to mind how little
          gratitude you have manifested for all the blessings of God. You have not deserved them; but because they have
          flowed in upon you day by day, year by year, you have looked upon them as a matter of course, thinking it was
          your right to receive every advantage, and give nothing in return.... The blessings of God are more than the
          hairs</p>
      <p>of our head, more than the sands of the seashore. Meditate upon His love and care for us, and may it inspire
          you with love that trials cannot interrupt nor afflictions quench.<a href="#page_421"><span
          class="ft42">50</span></a></p>
      <p>If we could only see the many dangers from which we are daily preserved by the holy angels, instead of
          complaining of our trials and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[117]</span><span class="ft34">misfortunes, we would talk continually of the mercies of
          God.</span><a href="#page_421"><span class="ft35">51</span></a></p>
