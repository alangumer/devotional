    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the</strong></p>
      <p>ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the</p>
      <p>seat of the scornful. <span class="ft44">Psalm 1:1</span>.</p>
      <p>The ungodly are those who do not love and obey the command- ments of God, but go contrary to them. This is the
          class of counselors you are warned to <nobr>shun,—the</nobr> class which Satan uses to lead youth astray.
          Their counsel, their suggestions, are of a character to make light of sin, to ridicule righteousness.... They
          are represented as stand-</p>
      <p>ing in the way of sinners, always leading them out of the straight path of duty and obedience to God’s
          commandments into paths of disobedience. If it were not for those persons who do wrong and tempt others to do
          wrong, many sinners might have chosen the path of duty, the life of purity and godliness.<a

      <p>The fear of ridicule leads many a youth to yield to temptation and to walk in the way of the ungodly.<a

      <p>Jesus would not place Himself in peril to please the devil. But how many today can stand a dare?<a
          href="#page_438"><span class="ft42">53</span></a></p>
      <p>Allow no taunts, no threats, no sneering remarks, to induce you to violate your conscience in the least
          particular, and thus open a door whereby Satan can come in and control the mind....</p>
      <p>You must be an interested student of the Bible.... His Word is a</p>
      <p>sure guide; if it is carefully studied, there is no danger of falling under the power of temptations that
          surround the youth, and crowd in upon them.<a href="#page_439"><span class="ft41">54</span></a></p>
      <p>Some may ridicule you for being so strict; they may call you <nobr>self-righteous;</nobr> but be careful to
          start right, and then keep quietly on. The history of Daniel, if all was written, would open chapters before
          you that would show you the temptations he had to meet, of ridicule, envy, and hatred; but ... he rose
          superior to ridicule; and so will every</p>
