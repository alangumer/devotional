      <p><strong>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye</strong></p>
      <p><span class="ft11">in him.</span>Colossians 2:6<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>You are fighting for the crown of life.... Live to please Him who</p>
      <p>thought you of such value that He gave Jesus, His only begotten Son, to save you from your sins.... Ever keep
          before you the thought that</p>
      <p>what is worth doing at all, is worth doing well. Depend upon God for wisdom, that you may not discourage one
          soul in right doing. Work with Christ in drawing souls to Him.... Do your very best in</p>
      <p>everything you undertake. Jesus is your Saviour, and rely upon Him to help you day by day, that you may not sow

          means that you are to study the life of Christ. You are to study it with as much more earnestness than you
          study secular lines of knowledge, as eternal interests are more important than temporal, earthly pursuits. If
          you appreciate the value and sacredness of eternal things, you will bring your sharpest thoughts, your best
          energies, to the solving of the prob- lem that involves your eternal <nobr>well-being;</nobr> for every other
          interest sinks into nothingness in comparison with that.</p>
      <p>You have the pattern, Christ Jesus; walk in His footsteps, and you will be qualified to fill any and every
          position that you may be called upon to occupy.... You are not to feel that you are a bond slave, but a</p>
