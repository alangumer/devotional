    <h1>Defenders of the Faith, September 19</h1>

      <p><strong>Ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once</strong></p>
      <p>delivered unto the saints. <span class="ft44">Jude 1:3</span>.</p>
      <p>Crime of every type is increasing in the world, and the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof. The
          eternal plans of God are about to be fulfilled, and the end of all things is at hand. This is a time when
          those who have a knowledge of the truth of God should be ranging themselves on the side of the

          realize that there are souls on every side who may be benefited by their help, example, and influence. They
          will realize that they may be agents through whom Jesus will work to save those for whom He died. This should
          be the experience of all who profess to believe the third angelâ€™s message. Young and old should have a rich,
