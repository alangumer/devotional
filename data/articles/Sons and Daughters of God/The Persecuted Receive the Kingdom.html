      <p><strong>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake:</strong></p>
      <p>for their’s is the kingdom of heaven. <span class="ft44">Matthew 5:10</span>.</p>
      <p>Jesus does not present to His followers the hope of attaining earthly glory and riches, and of having a life
          free from trial, but He presents to them the privilege of walking with their Master in the paths of
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and reproach, because the world knows them not.</p>
      <p>He who came to redeem the lost world, was opposed by the united forces of the adversaries of God and man. In an
          unpitying confederacy, evil men and evil angels arrayed themselves against the Prince of peace. Though His
          every word and act breathed of divine compassion, His unlikeness to the world provoked the bitterest
          hostility. Because He would give no license for the exercise of the evil passions of our nature, He aroused
          the fiercest opposition and enmity. So it is with all who will live godly in Christ Jesus. Between
          righteousness and sin, love and hatred, truth and falsehood, there is an irrepressible conflict. When one
          presents the love of Christ and the beauty of holiness, he is drawing away the subjects of Satan’s kingdom,
          and the prince of evil is aroused to resist it. Persecution and reproach await all who are imbued with the
          Spirit of Christ. The character of the persecution changes with the times; but the principle— the spirit that
          underlies <nobr>it—is</nobr> the same that has slain the chosen of the Lord ever since the days of Abel.</p>
      <p>As men seek to come into harmony with God, they will find that the offense of the cross has not ceased.
          Principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places are arrayed against all who yield obedience to the
          law of heaven. Therefore, so far from causing grief, persecution should bring joy to the disciples of Christ;
          for it is an evidence that they are following in the steps of their Master....</p>
      <p>Through trials and persecution, the <nobr>glory—character—of</nobr> God is</p>
