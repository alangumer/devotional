    <h1>We Love God’s Commandments More Than Gold,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>February 17</strong></p>
      <p>Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine</p>
      <p><span class="ft11">gold.</span>Psalm 119:127<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>In these days of peril shall we show less devotion to the truth of God, and less fervent attachment to His law,
          than in former years? The very condition of things exists which Christ declared would be, prior to His second
          coming in power and glory. The prevailing ungodliness tends to paralyze and even to destroy true faith and
          piety. But this is the very time when the gold of Christian integrity will shine brightest, in contrast to the
          dross of hypocrisy and corruption. Now is the time for Christ’s chosen to show their devotion to His
          <nobr>service,—the</nobr> time for all His followers to bear the noblest testimony for their Master by
          standing firm against the prevailing current of evil.</p>
      <p>As we see the results which have followed a disregard of God’s <nobr>law,—dishonesty,</nobr> theft,
          licentiousness, drunkenness, and murder,— we are prepared to say with the psalmist, “I love thy commandments
          above gold; yea, above fine gold”; “in keeping of them, there is great reward.” When the divine law is set
          aside, the greatest misery will result, both to families and to society. Our only hope of better things is to
          be found in a faithful adherence to the precepts of Jehovah. Infidel France once tried the experiment of
          rejecting the authority of God. What scenes of horror followed! Men cast aside the divine law as a yoke of
          bondage, and in their boasted liberty they placed themselves under the rule of the veriest tyrant. Anarchy and
          bloodshed ruled that terrible day. It was then demonstrated to the world that the surest way to undermine the
          foundation of order and government, is to set at naught the law of God....</p>
      <p>Instead of feeling that we are now in the slightest degree excusable in further transgression, we shall realize
          as never before the justice of God’s claims upon us, and the sacred character of His law, since Christ must
          die to maintain its authority. Ere long the obedient will see the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[55]</span><span class="ft34">blessed results that follow the keeping of all God’s
          commandments.</span><a href="#page_409"><span class="ft35">45</span></a></p>
