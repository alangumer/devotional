    <h1>Put on the Whole Armor of God, November 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may</strong></p>
      <p>be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to</p>
      <p><span class="ft11">stand.</span>Ephesians 6:13<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Let us, under all circumstances, preserve our confidence in Christ. He is to be everything to
          <nobr>us,—the</nobr> first, the last, the best in everything. Then let us educate our tongues to speak forth
          His praise, not only when we feel gladness and joy, but at all times.</p>
      <p>Let us keep the heart full of God’s precious promises, that we may speak words that will be a comfort and
          strength to others. Thus we may learn the language of the heavenly angels, who, if we are faithful, will be
          our companions through the eternal ages. Every day we should make advancement in gaining perfection of
          character, and this we shall certainly do if we press toward the mark of the prize of our high calling in
          Christ Jesus. Let us not talk of the great power of Satan, but of the great power of God....</p>
      <p>In every soul two powers are struggling earnestly for the victory. Unbelief marshals its forces, led by Satan,
          to cut us off from the Source of our strength. Faith marshals its forces, led by Christ, the author and
          finisher of our faith. Hour by hour, in the sight of the heavenly universe, the conflict goes forward. This is
          a <nobr>hand-to-hand</nobr> fight, and the great question is, Which shall obtain the mastery? This question
          each must decide for himself. In this warfare all must take a part, fighting on one side or the other. From
          the conflict there is no release.... We are urged to prepare for this conflict. “Be strong in</p>
      <p>the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against
          the wiles of the devil.” The warning is repeated, “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye
          may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”</p>
      <p>He ... to whom all power in heaven and earth has been given, will</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[329]</span><span class="ft34">come to the help of those who trust in Him.</span><a
