    <h1>Thoughtfulness, March 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels</strong></p>
      <p>of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,</p>
      <p>longsuffering. <span class="ft44">Colossians 3:12</span>.</p>
      <p>Look to Jesus as your guide and pattern.... Study how you can</p>
      <p>be like Him, in thoughtfulness for others, in meekness and humility. Thus may you “grow up into him in all
          things, which is the head, even Christ”; you may reflect His image, and be accepted of Him as His own, at His
          coming.<a href="#page_415"><span class="ft42">42</span></a></p>
      <p>When Jesus is comprehended by faith, and brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul, the Holy Spirit will
          mold and fashion the char- acter after the likeness of Christ. Lessons will then be daily learned in the
          school of Christ. The character of the tree will be known by its fruits. “By their fruits ye shall know them.”
          The Christian will shine as a light amid the moral darkness of the world. He will be tender of heart, and
          considerate of the feelings of others. The Word of God instructs us to be “wise as serpents, and harmless as
          doves,” and it is the duty of every Christian to bring himself under discipline to the rules of the Bible,
          that he may be “a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.” The work coming from the hands of those who do
          this, will be as lasting as eternity. It will not be mingled with a shred of selfishness, and it will not be
          loose, careless work.<a href="#page_415"><span class="ft43">43</span></a></p>
      <p>Tender affections should ever be cherished between husband and wife, parents and children, brothers and
          sisters. Every hasty word should be checked, and there should not be even the appearance of the lack of love
          one for another. It is the duty of everyone in the family to be pleasant, to speak kindly.</p>
      <p>Cultivate tenderness, affection, and love that have expression in little courtesies, in speech, in thoughtful
          attentions.<a href="#page_415"><span class="ft32">44</span></a></p>
      <p>It is the inward adorning, the graces of the Spirit, the kind word,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[84]</span><span class="ft34">the thoughtful consideration for others that God
          values.</span><a href="#page_415"><span class="ft35">45</span></a></p>
