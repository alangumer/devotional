    <h1>He Did Not Interfere With Those in Power, May 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my</strong></p>
      <p>kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now
          is my kingdom not from hence. <span class="ft36">John 18:36</span>.</p>
      <p>Today in the religious world there are multitudes who, as they believe, are working for the establishment of
          the kingdom of Christ as an earthly and temporal dominion. They desire to make our Lord the ruler of the
          kingdoms of this world, the ruler in its courts and camps, its legislative halls, its palaces and market
          places. They expect Him to rule through legal enactments, enforced by human authority. Since Christ is not now
          here in person, they themselves will undertake to act in His stead.... The establishment of such a kingdom is
          what the</p>
      <p>Jews desired in the days of Christ.... But He said, “My kingdom is</p>
      <p>not of this world.” He would not accept the earthly throne.</p>
      <p>The government under which Jesus lived was corrupt and oppres- sive; on every hand were crying
          <nobr>abuses,—extortion,</nobr> intolerance, and grinding cruelty. Yet the Saviour attempted no civil reforms.
          He attacked no national abuses, nor condemned the national enemies. He did not interfere with the authority or
          administration of those in power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly governments. Not because He
          was indifferent to the woes of men, but because the remedy did not lie in merely human and external measures.
          To be efficient, the cure must reach men individually, and must regenerate the heart.</p>
      <p>Not by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative assemblies, not by the patronage of worldly great
          men, is the kingdom of Christ established, but by the implanting of Christ’s nature in humanity through the
          work of the Holy Spirit. “As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
          them that</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[147]</span><span class="ft34">believe on his name.”</span><a href="#page_426"><span
