      <p><strong>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. <span class="ft44">Matthew</span></strong></p>

      <p>There were occasions when Christ spoke with an authority that sent His words home with irresistible force, with
          an overwhelming sense of the greatness of the Speaker, and the human agencies shrunk into nothingness in
          comparison with the One before them. They were deeply moved; their minds were impressed that He was repeating
          the command from the most excellent glory. As He summoned the world to listen, they were spellbound and
          entranced, and conviction came to their minds. Every word made for itself a place, and the hearers believed
          and received the words that they had no power to resist. Every word He uttered seemed to the hearers as the
          life of God. He was giving evidence that He was the light of the world and the authority of the church,
          claiming <nobr>pre-eminence</nobr> over them all.<a href="#page_454"><span class="ft49">48</span></a></p>
      <p>Jesus places meekness among the first qualifications for His king- dom. In His own life and character the
          divine beauty of this precious grace is revealed....</p>
      <p>Human nature is ever struggling for expression, ready for contest; but he who learns of Christ is emptied of
          self, of pride, of love of supremacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is yielded to the disposal of the
          Holy Spirit. Then we are not anxious to have the highest place.... We feel that our highest place is at the
          feet of our</p>
      <p>Saviour....</p>
      <p>Lowliness of heart, that meekness which is the fruit of abiding in Christ, is the true secret of blessing. “He
          will beautify the meek with salvation.” ... It was through the desire for <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> that
          sin entered into the world, and our first parents lost the dominion over this fair earth, their kingdom. It is
          through <nobr>self-abnegation</nobr> that Christ redeems that which was lost. And He says we are to overcome
          as He did. Through humility and <nobr>self-surrender</nobr> we may become heirs with</p>
