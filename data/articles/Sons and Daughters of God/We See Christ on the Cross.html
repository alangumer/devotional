      <p><strong>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. <span class="ft44">Mark 15:25</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The spotless Son of God hung upon the cross, His flesh lacerated with stripes; those hands so often reached out
          in blessing, nailed to the wooden bars; those feet so tireless on ministries of love, spiked to the tree; that
          royal head pierced by the crown of thorns; those quivering lips shaped to the cry of woe. And all that He
          <nobr>endured—the</nobr> blood drops that flowed from His head, His hands, His feet, the agony that racked His
          frame, and the unutterable anguish that filled His soul at the hiding of His Father’s <nobr>face—speaks</nobr>
          to each child of humanity, declaring, It is for thee that the Son of God consents to bear this burden of
          guilt; for thee He spoils the domain of death, and opens the gates of Paradise. He ... offers Himself upon the
          cross as a sacrifice, and this from love to thee. He, the <nobr>Sin-Bearer,</nobr> endures the wrath of divine
          justice, and for thy sake becomes sin itself.</p>
      <p>In silence the beholders watched for the end of the fearful scene. The sun shone forth; but the cross was still
          enveloped in darkness. Priests and rulers looked toward Jerusalem; and lo, the dense cloud had settled over
          the city, and the plains of Judea. The Sun of Righ- teousness, the Light of the world, was withdrawing His
          beams from the once favored city of Jerusalem. The fierce lightnings of God’s wrath were directed against the
          fated city.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the gloom lifted from the cross, and in clear, trumpetlike tones, that seemed to resound throughout
          creation, Jesus cried, “It is finished.” “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” A light encircled the
          cross, and the face of the Saviour shone with a glory</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[221]</span><span class="ft34">like the sun. He then bowed His head upon His breast, and
          died.</span><a href="#page_440"><span class="ft35">1</span></a></p>
