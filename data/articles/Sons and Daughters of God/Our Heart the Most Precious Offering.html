      <p><strong>My son [my daughter], give me thine heart, and let thine eyes</strong></p>
      <p>observe my ways. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 23:26</span>.</p>
      <p>Give to God the most precious offering that it is possible for you to make; give Him your heart. He speaks to
          you saying, “My son, My daughter, give Me thine heart. Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white
          as snow; for I will cleanse you with My own blood. I will make you members of My <nobr>family—children</nobr>
          of the heavenly King. Take My forgiveness, My peace which I freely give you. I will clothe you with My own
          <nobr>righteousness,—the</nobr> wedding <nobr>garment,—and</nobr> make you fit for the marriage supper of the
          Lamb. When clothed in My righteousness, through prayer, through watchfulness, through diligent study of My
          Word, you will be able to reach a high standard. You will understand the truth, and your character will be
          molded by a divine influence.<a href="#page_418"><span class="ft42">1</span></a></p>

          everything that is contrary to the revealed will and mind of God.<a href="#page_418"><span
          class="ft42">2</span></a></p>
      <p>Such a life ... will be full of comfort, full of satisfaction, because you are bringing heaven into your life,
          peace into your soul.... I would</p>
      <p>that all the young could understand how precious is the offering of a youthful heart to God. How lovingly the
          angels guard the steps of <nobr>God-fearing,</nobr><nobr>God-loving</nobr> youth. Jesus knows them by name,
          and their example is helping other youth to do right. The youth who has hidden within the heart and mind a
          store of God’s words of caution and encouragement, of His precious pearls of promise, from which</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[99]</span><span class="ft34">he can draw at any time, will be a living channel of
          light.</span><a href="#page_418"><span class="ft35">3</span></a></p>
