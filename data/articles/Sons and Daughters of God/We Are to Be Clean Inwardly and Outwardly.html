      <p>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your
          idols, will I cleanse you. <span class="ft36">Ezekiel 36:25</span>.</p>
      <p>In order to be acceptable in God’s sight, the leaders of the people were to give strict heed to the sanitary
          condition of the armies of Israel, even when they went forth to battle. Every soul, from the
          <nobr>commander-in-chief</nobr> to the lowest soldier in the army, was sacredly charged to preserve
          cleanliness in his person and surroundings; for the Israelites were chosen by God as His peculiar people. They
          were sacredly bound to be holy in body and spirit. They were not to be careless or neglectful of their
          personal duties. In every respect they were to preserve cleanliness. They were to allow nothing untidy or
          unwholesome in their surroundings, nothing which would taint the purity of the atmosphere.<a

      <p>The Ten Commandments, spoken by Jehovah from Sinai, cannot live in the hearts of persons of disorderly, filthy
          habits. If ancient Israel could not so much as listen to the proclamation of that holy law, unless they had
          obeyed the injunction of Jehovah, and had cleansed their clothing, how can that sacred law be written upon the
          hearts of persons who are not cleanly in person, in clothing, or in their houses? It is impossible.<a

      <p>Heaven is a clean and holy place. God is pure and holy. All who come into His presence should take heed to His
          directions, and have the body and the clothing in a pure, clean condition, thus showing respect to themselves
          and to Him. The heart must also be sanctified. Those who do this will not dishonor His sacred name by
          worshiping Him while their hearts are polluted and their apparel is untidy. God sees these things. He marks
          the <nobr>heart-preparation,</nobr> the thoughts, the cleanliness ... of those who worship Him.<a
