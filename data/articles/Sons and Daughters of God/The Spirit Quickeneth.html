    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they
          are spirit, and they are life.</strong></p>
      <p>John 6:63<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Only the Holy Spirit of God can quicken the perceptive faculties.<a href="#page_405"><span
          class="ft33">75</span></a>Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the
          Spirit given. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given
          according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to</p>
      <p>supply every soul according to the capacity to receive.</p>
      <p>The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. Those only who are thus taught of God,
          those only who possess the inward working of the Spirit, and in whose life the <nobr>Christ-life</nobr> is
          manifested, can stand as true representatives of the Saviour.</p>
      <p>God takes men as they are, and educates them for His service, if they will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit
          of God, received into the soul, quickens all its faculties. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the mind
          that is devoted unreservedly to God, develops harmoniously, and is strengthened to comprehend and fulfil the
          requirements of God. The weak, vacillating character becomes changed to one of strength and steadfastness.
          Continual devotion establishes so close a relation between Jesus and His disciples that the Christian becomes
          like his Master in character. He has clearer, broader views. His discernment is more penetrative, his judgment
          better balanced. So quickened is he by the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of the Sun of Righteousness that he
          is enabled to bear much fruit to the glory of God.<a href="#page_406"><span class="ft43">76</span></a></p>
      <p>The believers will be of one heart and of one mind, and the Lord will make His Word powerful in the earth. New
          cities and villages and territories will be entered; the church will arise and shine, because her light has
          come, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon her.... If the</p>
