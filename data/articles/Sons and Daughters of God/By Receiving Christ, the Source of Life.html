      <p><strong>In him was life; and the life was the light of men. <span class="ft44">John 1:4</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has made every provision so that we may have a rich, abundant, joyful experience. John writes
          concerning Christ, saying, “In him was life; and the life was the light of men.” Life is associated with
          light, and if we have no light from the Sun of Righteousness, we can have no life in Him. But this light has
          been provided for every soul, and it is only as we withdraw from the light that darkness comes upon us. Jesus
          said, “He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” In the world about
          us there can be no life without light. Were the sun to withdraw his shining, all vegetation, all animal life,
          would have an end. This illustrates the fact that we cannot have spiritual life unless we place ourselves
          under the beams of the Sun of Righteousness. If we put a flowering plant in a dark room, it will soon wither
          and die; and so we may have some spiritual life, and yet lose it by dwelling in an atmosphere of doubt and
          gloom....</p>
      <p>We are called, as was John, not to take the place of Christ, but to witness to the light, to direct the minds
          of others to Him.... Let no</p>
      <p>one who would witness for Christ, make himself prominent, and seek to attract the attention of the people to
          himself; but let him strive to lift up Jesus.<a href="#page_450"><span class="ft41">1</span></a></p>
      <p>Humanity has in itself no light. Apart from Christ, we are like an unkindled taper, like the moon when her face
          is turned away from the sun; we have not a single ray of brightness to shed into the darkness of the world.
          But when we turn toward the Sun of Righteousness, when we come in touch with Christ, the whole soul is aglow
          with the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[282]</span><span class="ft34">brightness of the divine presence.</span><a
