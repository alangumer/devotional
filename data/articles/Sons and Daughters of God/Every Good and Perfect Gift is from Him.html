    <h1>Every Good and Perfect Gift is from Him, January 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with
          whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. <span class="ft30">James 1:17</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>The power of God is manifested in the beating of the heart, in the action of the lungs, and in the living
          currents that circulate through the thousand different channels of the body. We are indebted to Him for every
          moment of existence, and for all the comforts of life. The powers and abilities that elevate man above the
          lower creation, are the endowment of the Creator. He loads us with His benefits. We are indebted to Him for
          the food we eat, the water we drink, the clothes we wear, the air we breathe. Without His special providence,
          the air would be filled with pestilence and poison. He is a bountiful benefactor and preserver. The sun which
          shines upon the earth, and glorifies all nature, the weird solemn radiance of the moon, the glories of the
          firmament, spangled with brilliant stars, the showers that refresh the land, and cause vegetation to flourish,
          the precious things of nature in all their varied richness, the lofty trees, the shrubs and plants, the waving
          grain, the blue sky, the green earth, the changes of day and night, the renewing seasons, all speak to man of
          his Creator’s love. He has linked us to Himself by all these tokens in heaven and in earth.<a

      <p>We may state to Him our temporal matters, asking Him for bread and raiment as well as for the bread of life and
          the robe of Christ’s righteousness.... The gifts of Him who has all power in heaven and</p>
      <p>earth are in store for the children of God. Gifts so precious that they come to us through the costly sacrifice
          of the Redeemer’s blood; gifts that will satisfy the deepest craving of the heart; gifts lasting as eternity,
          will be received and enjoyed by all who will come to God as little children. Take God’s promises as your own,
          plead them before</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[18]</span><span class="ft34">Him as His own words, and you will receive fulness of
          joy.</span><a href="#page_403"><span class="ft35">38</span></a></p>
