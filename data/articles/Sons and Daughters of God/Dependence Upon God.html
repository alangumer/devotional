    <h1>Dependence Upon God, March 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For without me ye can do nothing. <span class="ft44">John 15:5</span>, last part.</strong></p>
      <p>The first lesson to be taught ... is the lesson of dependence upon God.... As a flower of the field has its
          root in the soil; as it must</p>
      <p>receive air, dew, showers, and sunshine, so must we receive from God that which ministers to the life of the
          soul.<a href="#page_414"><span class="ft41">27</span></a></p>
      <p>The presence of God is guaranteed to the Christian. This Rock of faith is the living presence of God. The
          weakest may depend upon it. Those who think themselves the strongest may become the weakest unless they depend
          on Christ as their efficiency, their worthiness. This is the Rock upon which we may build successfully. God is
          near in Christ’s atoning sacrifice, in His intercession, His loving, tender ruling power over the church.
          Seated by the eternal throne, He watches them with intense interest. As long as the members of the church
          shall through faith draw sap and nourishment from Jesus Christ, and not from man’s opinions and devisings and
          methods; if having a conviction of the nearness of God in Christ, they put their entire trust in Him, they
          will have a vital connection with Christ as the branch has connection with the parent stock. The church is
          established not on theories of men, on <nobr>long-drawn-out</nobr> plans and forms. It depends upon Christ
          their righteousness. It is built on faith in Christ, “and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”
          ...</p>
      <p>The strength of every soul is in God and not in man. Quietness and confidence is to be the strength of all who
          give their hearts to God. Christ has not a casual interest in us but an interest stronger than a mother for
          her child.... Our Saviour has purchased us by human</p>
      <p>suffering and sorrow, by insult, reproach, abuse, mockery, rejection, and death. He is watching over you,
          trembling child of God. He will make you secure under His protection.... Our weakness in human</p>
      <p>nature will not bar our access to the heavenly Father, for He [Christ]</p>
