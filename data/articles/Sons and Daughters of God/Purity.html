    <h1>Purity, March 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by</strong></p>
      <p>the pureness of thine hands. <span class="ft44">Job 22:30</span>.</p>
      <p>He who deservedly bears the name of Christian, which signifies Christlike, will be filled with piety and
          purity, with love and reverence for God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent; and his spirit, his words, his
          actions, will all bear the impress of Heaven. Others will see that he has been with Jesus and learned of Him,
          His prayers will be simple and fervent, and will ascend to God on the wings of faith. Learning in the school
          of Christ, he will have a humble opinion of himself; and though he may be poor in this world’s goods, he may
          be rich in the graces of God’s Spirit, and may bless and enrich others by his spirit and influence, because
          Christ is in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. He will shed about him an atmosphere of
          hope and courage and strength, and will put to shame those who are worldly, selfish, formal professors, who
          have a name to live and are dead.<a href="#page_415"><span class="ft33">50</span></a></p>
      <p>The precious faith inspired of God imparts strength and nobility of character. As His goodness, His mercy, and
          His love are dwelt upon, clearer and still clearer will be the perception of truth; higher, holier, the desire
          for purity of heart and clearness of thought. The soul dwelling in the pure atmosphere of holy thought is
          transformed by intercourse with God through the study of His Word. Truth is so large, so
          <nobr>far-reaching,</nobr> so deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of. The heart is softened, and subdued
          into humility, kindness, and love....</p>
      <p>Being <nobr>pure-minded,</nobr> they will become <nobr>strong-minded.<a href="#page_415"><span
          class="ft35">51</span></a></nobr></p>
      <p>Purity of heart and loveliness of spirit are more precious than gold,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[86]</span><span class="ft34">both for time and for eternity. Only the pure in heart shall
          see God.</span><a href="#page_416"><span class="ft35">52</span></a></p>
