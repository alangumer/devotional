      <p><strong>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he
          purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. <span class="ft36">John 15:2</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who will walk closely in the footsteps of their self- sacrificing, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> Redeemer
          will have the mind of Christ re- flected in their minds. Purity and the love of Christ will shine forth in
          their daily lives and characters, while meekness and truth will guide their way. Every fruitful branch is
          pruned, that it may bring forth more fruit. Even fruitful branches may display too much foliage and appear
          what they really are not. The followers of Christ may be doing some work for the Master and yet not be doing
          half what they might do. He then prunes them, because worldliness, <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> and pride are
          cropping out in their lives. Husbandmen clip off the surplus tendrils of the vines ..., thus making them more
          fruitful. These hindering causes must be removed and the defective outgrowth cut away, to give room for the
          healing beams of the Sun of Righteousness....</p>
      <p>Many misunderstand the object for which they were created. It was to bless humanity and glorify God, rather
          than to enjoy and glorify self. God is constantly pruning His people, cutting off profuse, spreading branches,
          that they may bear fruit to His glory and not produce leaves only. God prunes us with sorrow, with
          disappointment and affliction, that the outgrowth of strong, perverse traits of character may be weakened and
          that the better traits may have a chance to develop. Idols must be given up, the conscience must become more
          tender, the meditations of the heart must be spiritual, and the entire character must become symmetrical.<a

      <p>By abiding in Christ, we may have His sweetness, His fragrance, His light.... He shines in our hearts. His
          light in our hearts shines</p>
      <p>forth from our faces. By beholding the beauty and the glory of Christ,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[290]</span><span class="ft34">we become changed into the same image.</span><a
