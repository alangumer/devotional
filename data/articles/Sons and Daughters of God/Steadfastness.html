      <p><strong>For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt</strong></p>

      <p>It is right for the youth to feel that they must reach the highest development of their mental powers. We would
          not restrict the educa- tion to which God has set no limit. But our attainments avail nothing if not put to
          use for the honor of God and the good of humanity....</p>

          cultivated tendencies to evil must be overcome. Often the education and training of a lifetime must be
          discarded, that one may become a learner in the school of Christ. Our hearts must be educated to become
          steadfast in God. We are to form habits of thought that will enable us to resist temptation. We must learn to
          look upward. The principles of the Word of <nobr>God,—principles</nobr> that are as high as heaven, and that
          compass <nobr>eternity,—we</nobr> are to understand in their bearing upon our daily life. Every act, every
