      <p><strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.</strong></p>
      <p>Hebrews 12:2<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Many of the youth repine because they have not ability to do some large work, and they covet talents by which
          they might do some wonderful things; but while they are spending their time in vain desires, they are making a
          failure of life. They are overlooking opportunities which they might improve in doing deeds of love in the
          path of life in which their feet are set....</p>
      <p>O that you would now consider the things that make for your peace, and devote your affections, your thoughts,
          your time, your service, to Christ. Satan is concentrating all his energies to bend your will to his, to make
          you his agent in opposing the plans of Christ, that you may refuse to have Jesus reign over you. Although you
          know that “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
          not perish, but have everlasting life,” Satan ... will seek to draw you away from Christ, that you may become
          his agent in drawing others away, and thus frustrate the plans of God. He is the father of lies, and he weaves
          a net of falsehood in which he binds you with cords of lies to his service. The more intelligent you are, the
          more attractive, the harder he will work that he may persuade you to lay your talents at his feet, and aid him
          to accomplish his ends in alluring others under his black banner. If he can only keep the mind infatuated, he
          will do it. Paul inquires, “Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?” Satan is the
          bewitcher, and he has wrought, that Christ may be expelled from the soul, and that he himself may be there
          enthroned.</p>
      <p>I beg of you, sons and daughters, to break from the infatuation of the evil one. Flee to Jesus as your refuge,
          and lay hold upon eternal life.<a href="#page_458"><span class="ft41">53</span></a></p>
