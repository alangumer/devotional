    <h1>Joseph Chose Life’s Best, Samson Did Not, June 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption;</strong></p>
      <p>but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life</p>
      <p>everlasting. <span class="ft44">Galatians 6:8</span>.</p>
      <p>Few temptations are more dangerous or more fatal to young men than the temptation to sensuality and none if
          yielded to will prove so decidedly ruinous to soul and body for time and eternity. The welfare of his entire
          future is suspended upon the decision of a moment. Joseph calmly casts his eyes to heaven for help, slips off
          his loose outer garment, leaving it in the hand of his tempter and while his eye is lighted with determined
          resolve in the place of unholy passion, he exclaims, “How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
          God?” The victory is gained; he flees from the enchanter; he is saved.<a href="#page_435"><span

      <p>Samson in his peril had the same source of strength as had Joseph. He could choose the right or the wrong as he
          pleased. But instead of taking hold of the strength of God, he permitted the wild passions of his nature to
          have full sway. The reasoning powers were perverted, the morals corrupted. God had called Samson to a position
          of great responsibility, honor, and usefulness; but he must first learn to govern by first learning to obey
          the laws of God.... Samson, under ... tempta-</p>
      <p>tions, which he had brought upon himself, gave loose rein to passion. The path which he entered upon he found
          to end in shame, disaster, and death. What a contrast to the history of Joseph!<a href="#page_435"><span

      <p>Amidst the snares to which all are exposed, they need strong and trustworthy defenses on which to rely.... The
          shield of grace can</p>
      <p>preserve all unconquered by the temptations of the enemy, though surrounded with the most corrupting
          influences. By firm principle, and unwavering trust in God, their virtue and nobleness of character can shine,
          and, although surrounded with evil, no taint need be left</p>
