    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with</strong></p>
      <p><span class="ft11">singing.</span>Psalm 100:2<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet and pure, and there will be fewer words of censure,
          and more of cheerfulness and hope and joy.... As a part of religious service, singing is as much</p>
      <p>an act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer.<a href="#page_433"><span
          class="ft35">69</span></a></p>
      <p>I feel alarmed as I witness everywhere the frivolity of young men and young women who profess to believe the
          truth.... They have a</p>
      <p>keen ear for music, and Satan knows what organs to excite to animate, engross, and charm the mind, so that
          Christ is not desired.... Solemn</p>
      <p>responsibilities rest upon the young, which they lightly regard. The introduction of music into their homes,
          instead of inciting to holiness and spirituality, has been the means of diverting their minds from the truth.
          Frivolous songs and the popular sheet music of the day seem congenial to their taste. The instruments of music
          have taken time which should have been devoted to prayer. Music, when not abused, is a great blessing; but
          when put to a wrong use, it is a terrible curse.<a href="#page_433"><span class="ft62">70</span></a></p>
      <p>What if you have been educated and trained in the art of music, and yet have never been taught to sing the new
          song? What will all this training amount to, if you have not been properly trained to be members of the Lord’s
          family, sons and daughters of God?<a href="#page_433"><span class="ft33">71</span></a></p>
      <p>No one who has an indwelling Saviour will dishonor Him before others by producing strains from a musical
          instrument which call the mind from God and Heaven to light and trifling things.<a href="#page_433"><span
          class="ft32">72</span></a></p>
      <p>Music was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts to that which is pure, noble, and elevating, and
          to awaken in the soul devotion and gratitude to God.<a href="#page_433"><span class="ft42">73</span></a></p>
      <p>As the Lord’s army of workers here below sing their songs of praise, the choir above join with them in
          thanksgiving, ascribing</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[180]</span><span class="ft34">praise to God and to His Son.</span><a href="#page_433"><span
          class="ft35">74</span></a></p>
