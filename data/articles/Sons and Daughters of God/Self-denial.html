      <p><strong>Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. <span class="ft44">Mark 10:28</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>All have daily lessons to learn in the school of Christ, and a daily experience to gain, that they may
          understand their duty as His children.</p>
      <p>Many an honest, <nobr>well-meaning</nobr> person makes no advancement in the Christian life because he does not
          see the necessity of constantly learning more of Jesus. When first converted, he rejoices that he has taken
          his position on the Lordâ€™s side. A year later, he bears the same testimony. There is no evidence of spiritual
          growth; he is still weak as a child.... The first experience of the new convert is happy and</p>
      <p>joyous; but trials come; the perplexities of life are to be met; sinful traits of character that have not been
          controlled, strive for the mastery, and too frequently obtain it. Then come a loss of confidence and peace,
          neglect of prayer and the reading of the Scriptures. For want of the knowledge and experience which they
          should have, many are overcome by Satan. They do not know how to discern his temptations, or to resist
          them....</p>
      <p>Have faith in Jesus as your helper. Remember that you are not to choose your own work, or follow your own ways,
          but to look to Jesus as your guide and pattern. Keep His example before you, and constantly ask what will be
          pleasing in His sight. Learn from Him lessons of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacrifice.<a

      <p>Watch every moment, keeping your mind stayed upon God, in- stead of having it upon dress, and suffering pride
          to dwell in your heart. Seek to deny yourself; be holy; let your mind dwell upon heaven, and let your
          conversation be there also.... Those who follow Christ will</p>
      <p>choose the suffering, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> part, and will have His approbation</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[90]</span><span class="ft34">here, and ... glory, immortality and eternal life
          hereafter.</span><a href="#page_416"><span class="ft35">63</span></a></p>
