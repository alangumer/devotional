    <h1>Blind Bartimaeus’ Faith in God’s Grace Rewarded,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>April 29</strong></p>
      <p>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him,
          Lord, that I might receive my sight. <span class="ft36">Mark 10:51</span>.</p>
      <p>It is only when the sinner feels the need of a Saviour, that his heart goes after the One who can help him.
          When Jesus walked among men, it was the sick that wanted a physician. The poor, the afflicted and distressed,
          followed after Him, to receive the help and comfort which they could not find elsewhere. Blind Bartimeus is
          waiting by the wayside; he has waited long to meet Christ.</p>
      <p>Throngs of people who possess their sight are passing to and fro, but they have no desire to see Jesus. One
          look of faith would touch His heart of love, and bring them the blessings of His grace; but they know not the
          sickness and poverty of their souls, and they feel no need of Christ. Not so with the poor blind man. His only
          hope is in Jesus. As he waits and watches, he hears the tread of many feet, and he eagerly inquires, What
          means this noise of travel? The <nobr>by-standers</nobr> answer that “Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.” With the
          eagerness of intense desire, he cries, “Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me!” They try to silence him,
          but he cries the more vehemently, “Thou Son of David, have mercy on me!” This appeal is heard. His persevering
          faith is rewarded. Not only is physical sight restored, but the eyes of his understanding are opened. In
          Christ he sees his Redeemer, and the Sun of Righteousness shines into his soul. All who feel their need of
          Christ as did blind Bartimeus, and who will be as earnest and determined as he was, will, like him, receive
          the blessing which they crave.</p>
      <p>The afflicted, suffering ones who sought Christ as their helper, were charmed with the divine perfection, the
          beauty of holiness, that shone forth in His character.<a href="#page_422"><span
