      <p>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will</p>
      <p>give you rest. <span class="ft44">Matthew 11:28</span>.</p>
      <p>It is today that the sweet voice of mercy is falling upon your ears. It is today that the heavenly invitation
          comes to you. It is today that in Heaven everything says, Come.<a href="#page_412"><span
          class="ft41">1</span></a></p>
      <p>Come, for all things are now ready. Whosoever will, let him come and partake of the waters of life freely. It
          is now that we want childlike simplicity. We want to see everything like pride, and vanity, and folly, put
          away. We have the Judgment in view. Men and women will want strength that is greater than any human aid to
          lean upon. They must lean upon the mighty arm of Jehovah. We have in view that day when the works of men are
          to be tried, and tested; and we want you to get ready.... We make appeals to you to rid yourselves of the
          pride of</p>
      <p>the world, the pride and vanity, and folly, of life. Jesus loves you. Jesus pities you. The angelic host He
          sends to minister unto you. And now, while all Heaven is interested for you, will you be interested for
          yourselves?<a href="#page_412"><span class="ft42">2</span></a></p>
      <p>Some men seem afraid to take God at His word as though it would be presumption in them. They pray for the Lord
          to teach us and yet are afraid to credit the pledged word of God and believe we have been taught of Him. So
          long as we come to our heavenly Father humbly and with a spirit to be taught, willing and anxious to learn,
          why should we doubt Godâ€™s fulfillment of His own promise? ... When you have sought to know His will, your part
          in the operation with God is to believe that you will be led and guided and blessed in the doing of His
          will.... It is Christ who is guiding His people today, showing them</p>
