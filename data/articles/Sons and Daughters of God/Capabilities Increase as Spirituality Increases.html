      <p>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had
          understanding in all visions and dreams. <span class="ft36">Daniel 1:17</span>.</p>
      <p>The ignorance of many is voluntary and inexcusable.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft35">26</span></a></p>
      <p>Some young persons ... do not improve their advantages. They would like to read and write accurately, but the
          price of excellence is hard work, and they will not pay it. They remind me of the youth whose father sent him
          to school, and gave him every advantage for gaining a good education; but he neglected to study, saying that
          his father was able to give him a liberal education, and he was not going to bother his brains about it. You
          will all say at once that he would remain ignorant, for there is no royal road to learning. But wishing for a
          healthy religious experience without making earnest, <nobr>self-denying</nobr> effort, will be equally
          useless. Sighing over your ignorance of divine things will never make you wise unto salvation. There are ten
          thou- sand sluggish tears and sighs toward heaven that will never win one smile of approval from Jesus. Do not
          think that a Christian experience will come to you of itself. When you make up your mind to do some- thing on
          which your heart is set, you do not give up for difficulties, but try again and again.<a

      <p>Daniel and his three companions ... were <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> because they had yielded themselves to the
          control of the Holy Spirit. These youth gave to God all the glory of their secular, scientific, and religious
          endowments. Their learning did not come by chance; they obtained knowledge by the faithful use of their
          powers; and God gave them skill and understanding.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft42">28</span></a></p>
      <p>As in the case of Daniel, in exact proportion as the spiritual character is developed, the intellectual
          capabilities are increased.<a href="#page_456"><span class="ft32">29</span></a></p>
      <p>The Lord will <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with all who earnestly strive to be faithful in His service, as He
          <nobr>co-operated</nobr> with Daniel and his three compan-</p>
