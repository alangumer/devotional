    <h1>We are to Behave Ourselves Wisely, November 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.... I will walk within</strong></p>
      <p>my house with a perfect heart. <span class="ft44">Psalm 101:2</span>.</p>
      <p>None are to be forward or obtrusive, but we are quietly to live out our religion, with an eye single to the
          glory of God.... Then we</p>
      <p>shall shine as lights in the world, without noise or friction. None need fail; for One is with them who is wise
          in counsel, excellent in working, and mighty to accomplish His designs. He works through His agents, seen and
          unseen, human and divine. This work is a grand work, and will be carried forward to the glory of God, if all
          who are connected with it will make their works correspond to their profession of faith. Purity of thought
          must be cherished as indispensable to the work of influencing others. The soul must be surrounded by a pure,
          holy atmosphere, an atmosphere that will tend to quicken the spiritual life of all who inhale it.</p>
      <p>Jesus is honored or dishonored by the words and deportment of His professed followers. The heart must be kept
          pure and holy, for out of it are the issues of life. If the heart is purified through obedience to the truth,
          there will be no selfish preferences, no corrupt motives. There will be no partiality, no hypocrisy....</p>
      <p>In the present state of society, with the lax morals of not only youth but those of age and experience, there
          is great danger of becoming careless, and giving especial attention to favorites, and thus creating envy,
          jealousy, and <nobr>evil-surmising.</nobr> But few realize that they drive away the Spirit of God with their
          selfish thoughts and feelings, their foolish, trifling talk.... If the grace of Christ were planted in
          their</p>
      <p>hearts, and striking its roots down deep into good soil, they would bear fruit of an altogether different
          character.... The converting power</p>
      <p>of God is alone sufficient to establish pure principles in the heart, so that the wicked one may find nothing
          to assail.... Purity in speech,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[317]</span><span class="ft34">and true Christian courtesy should be constantly
          practised.</span><a href="#page_455"><span class="ft35">13</span></a></p>
