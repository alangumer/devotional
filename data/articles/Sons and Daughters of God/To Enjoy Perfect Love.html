    <h1>To Enjoy Perfect Love, July 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth
          is not made perfect in love. <span class="ft36">1 John 4:18</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>This is an important statement; for there are many who desire to love and serve God, and yet when afflictions
          comes upon them, they do not discern the love of God in it, but the hand of the enemy. They mourn and murmur
          and complain; but this is not the fruit of love to God in the soul. If we have perfect love, we shall know
          that God is not seeking to injure us, but that in the midst of trials, and griefs, and pains, He is seeking to
          make us perfect, and to test the quality of our faith. When we cease to worry about the future, and begin to
          believe that God loves us, and means to do us good, we shall trust Him as a child trusts a loving parent. Then
          our troubles and torments will disappear, and our will will be swallowed up in the will of God.<a

          love....</p>
      <p>Our relations with one another should be pleasant. When we do right, the testimony of our own spirit and the
          testimony of the Spirit of God bear witness that the human mind is under the control of the divine mind....
          His Word furnishes evidence from which we may draw</p>
      <p>the conclusion that we are indeed His sons and daughters.... True love</p>
      <p>for God carries with it true, reverential trust. And he who loves God will love his brother also.<a

      <p>“Now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these <nobr>three,”—faith,</nobr> which takes hold of Omnipotence and
          refuses to be baffled; hope, which turns the future triumphs of the good and the true into present en-
          couragement and joy; and love, which consecrates all to God and for</p>
