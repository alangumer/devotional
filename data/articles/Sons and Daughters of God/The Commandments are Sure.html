    <h1>The Commandments are Sure, February 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
          uprightness. <span class="ft45">Psalm 111:7, 8</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Adam and Eve, at their creation, had a knowledge of the law of God. It was printed on their hearts, and they
          understood its claims upon them. The law of God existed before man was created. It was adapted to the
          condition of holy beings; even angels were governed by it. After the fall, the principles of righteousness
          were unchanged. Nothing was taken from the law; not one of its holy precepts could be improved. And as it has
          existed from the beginning, so will it continue to exist throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity.<a
          href="#page_406"><span class="ft33">1</span></a></p>
      <p>Our duty to obey this law is to be the burden of this last message of mercy to the world. God’s law is not a
          new thing. It is not holiness created, but holiness made known. It is a code of principles expressing mercy,
          goodness, and love. It presents to fallen humanity the character of God, and states plainly the whole duty of
          man.<a href="#page_406"><span class="ft54">2</span></a></p>
      <p>The law of love being the foundation of the government of God, the happiness of all intelligent beings depends
          upon their perfect accord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires from all His creatures the
          service of <nobr>love—service</nobr> that springs from an appreciation of His character. He takes no pleasure
          in a forced obedi- ence; and to all He grants freedom of will, that they may render Him voluntary service.<a
          href="#page_407"><span class="ft42">3</span></a></p>
      <p>“All His commandments are sure....” Whatever is built upon the</p>
      <p>authority of man will be overthrown; but that which is founded upon the rock of God’s immutable word shall
          stand forever.<a href="#page_407"><span class="ft42">4</span></a></p>
      <p>The sacred statutes which Satan has hated and sought to destroy,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[39]</span><span class="ft34">will be honored throughout a sinless universe.</span><a
