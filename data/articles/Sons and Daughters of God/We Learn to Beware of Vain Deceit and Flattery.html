    <h1>We Learn to Beware of Vain Deceit and Flattery,</h1>

      <p>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
          rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. <span class="ft36">Colossians 2:8</span>.</p>
      <p>Flattery is an art by which Satan lieth in wait to deceive and to puff up the human agent with high thoughts of
          himself.... Flattery has</p>
      <p>been the food upon which many of our youth have been nourished; and those who have praised and flattered have
          supposed that they were doing right; but they have been doing wrong. Praise, flattery, and indulgence have
          done more toward leading precious souls into false paths, than any other art that Satan has devised. Flattery
          is a part of the world’s policy, but it is no part of Christ’s policy. Through flattery poor human beings,
          full of frailty and infirmities, come to think that they are efficient and worthy, and become puffed up in
          their fleshly mind. They become intoxicated with the idea that they possess ability beyond what they do have,
          and their religious experience becomes unbalanced. Unless in the providence of God they shall be turned from
          these deceptions, and become converted, and learn the <nobr>a-b-c</nobr> of religion in the school of Christ,
          they will lose their souls. Many a youth has been flattered that he has ability as a natural gift; when the
          ability he thinks he has, can be attained only through diligent training and culture, learning the meekness
          and lowliness of Christ....</p>
      <p>God permits him to be attacked by the enemy, in order that he may understand his own weakness. He is permitted
          to make some decided blunder, and is plunged into painful humiliation. But when he is writhing under a sense
          of his own weakness, he is not to be judged harshly.... This is the time when he needs a friend who ... will
          deal</p>
      <p>patiently and faithfully with the erring.... He is not to be lifted up by</p>
      <p>the aid of flattery.... Rather he is to be pointed to the first rounds of</p>
      <p>the ladder, and his stumbling feet are to be placed on the lowest round of the ladder of progress.... Through
          the aid of wise counselors, his</p>
