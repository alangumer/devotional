    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
          Jesus. <span class="ft36">Philippians 4:7</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>When we receive Christ as an abiding guest in the soul, the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, will
          keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The Saviour’s life on earth, though lived in the midst of
          conflict, was a life of peace. While angry enemies were constantly pursuing Him, He said, “He that sent me is
          with me; the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.” No storm of human
          or satanic wrath could disturb the calm of that perfect communion with God. And He says to us: “Peace I leave
          with you, my peace I give unto you.” “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
          heart, and ye shall find rest.” Bear with Me the yoke of service for the glory of God and the uplifting of
          humanity, and you will find the yoke easy, and the burden light....</p>
      <p>Happiness drawn from earthly sources is as changeable as varying circumstances can make it; but the peace of
          Christ is a constant and abiding peace. It does not depend upon any circumstances in life, on the amount of
          worldly goods, or the number of earthly friends. Christ is the fountain of living water, and happiness drawn
          from Him can never fail.<a href="#page_418"><span class="ft42">15</span></a></p>
      <p>Every man’s experience testifies to the truth of the words of Scrip- ture, “The wicked are like the troubled
          sea, when it cannot rest....</p>
      <p>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked,” Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we can
          find no rest. The mas- terful passions of the heart no human power can control. We are as helpless here as
          were the disciples to quiet the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee, has spoken the
          word of peace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus ... will find deliverance.
