    <h1>Law of Love Written in Our Hearts, February 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their</strong></p>
      <p>inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.... I will
          forgive their iniquity, and I</p>
      <p>will remember their sin no more. <span class="ft44">Jeremiah 31:33, 34</span>.</p>
      <p>The work Christianity is designed to achieve in the world is not to depreciate the law of God, not to detract
          from its sacred dignity in the slightest degree, but it is to write that law in the mind and heart. When the
          law of God is thus implanted in the soul of the believer, he is approaching eternal life through the merits of
          Jesus....</p>
      <p>The object of the gospel is met when this great end is achieved. Its work from age to age is to unite the
          hearts of His followers in a spirit of universal brotherhood, through belief of the truth, and thus establish
          heaven’s system of order and harmony in the family of God on earth, that they may be accounted worthy to
          become members of the royal family above. God, in His wisdom and mercy, tests men and women here, to see if
          they will obey His voice and respect His law, or rebel as Satan did....</p>
      <p>God’s object in giving the law to the fallen race was that man might, through Jesus, rise from his low estate
          to be one with God, that the greatest moral changes might be manifested in his nature and character. This
          moral transformation must take place, or man would not be a safe subject in the kingdom of God; for he would
          raise a revolt....</p>
      <p>Here in this life is the testing, trying time. The angels of God are watching the development of character, and
          weighing moral worth. The whole question is settled in this, Is he obedient or disobedient to the commandments
          of God? has the sinner been transformed in this world, through the merits of Christ, to an obedient servant,
          so that he is fitted to join the heavenly society?<a href="#page_409"><span class="ft33">35</span></a></p>
