      <p>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh
          his name in vain. <span class="ft36">Exodus 20:7</span>.</p>
      <p>The reason for this command is given: we are not to swear “by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by
          the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
          Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.” All things come of
          God. We have nothing that we have not received; and, more than this, we have nothing that has not been
          purchased for us by the blood of Christ.<a href="#page_410"><span class="ft33">55</span></a></p>
      <p>Burning words of passion should never be spoken, for in the sight of God and holy angels they are as a species
          of swearing.<a href="#page_410"><span class="ft32">56</span></a></p>
      <p>This commandment not only prohibits false oaths and common swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God
          in a light or careless manner, without regard to its awful significance. By the thoughtless mention of God in
          common conversation, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the frequent and thoughtless repetition of
          His name, we dishonor Him. “Holy and reverend in his name.” All should meditate upon His majesty, His purity
          and holiness, that the heart may be impressed with a sense of His exalted character; and His holy name should
          be uttered with reverence and solemnity.<a href="#page_410"><span class="ft33">57</span></a></p>
      <p>It is not men whom we are to exalt and worship; it is God, the only true and living God, to whom our worship
          and reverence are due. According to the teaching of the Scriptures, it dishonors God to address ministers as
          “reverend.” No mortal has any right to attach this to his own name, or to the name of any other human being.
          It belongs only to God, to distinguish Him from every other being....</p>
      <p>“Holy and reverend is his name.” We dishonor God when we use this word where it does not belong.... The Father
          and the Son alone are to</p>
