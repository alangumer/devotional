    <h1>We Shall Not Lie, or Bear False Witness, February 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. <span class="ft44">Exodus</span></strong></p>
      <p>20:16<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>The ninth commandment requires of us an inviolable regard for exact truth in every declaration by which the
          character of our fellow men may be affected. The tongue, which is kept so little under the control of the
          human agent, is to be bridled by strong conscientious principles, by the law of love toward God and man.<a
          href="#page_412"><span class="ft32">81</span></a></p>
      <p><nobr>False-speaking</nobr> in any matter, every attempt or purpose to deceive our neighbor, is here included.
          An intention to deceive is what con- stitutes falsehood. By a glance of the eye, a motion of the hand, an
          expression of the countenance, as falsehood may be told as effectually as by words. All intentional
          overstatement, every hint or insinuation calculated to convey an erroneous or exaggerated impression, even the
          statement of facts in such a manner as to mislead, is falsehood. This precept forbids every effort to injure
          our neighbor’s reputation by misrepresentation or evil surmising, by slander or <nobr>tale-bearing.</nobr>
          Even the intentional suppression of truth, by which injury may result to others, is a violation of the ninth
          commandment.<a href="#page_412"><span class="ft49">82</span></a></p>
      <p>He [Jesus] teaches that the exact truth should be the law of speech. “Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay.”
          ... These words condemn all those meaningless phrases and expletives that border on profanity. They condemn
          the deceptive compliments, the evasion of truth, the flattering phrases, the exaggerations, the
          misrepresentations in trade, that are current in society and in the business world. They teach that no one who
          tries to appear what he is not, or whose words do not convey the real sentiment of his heart, can be called
          truthful....</p>
      <p>Everything that Christians do should be as transparent as the sunlight. Truth is of God; deception, in every
          one of its myriad forms, is of Satan.... We can not speak the truth unless our minds are</p>
