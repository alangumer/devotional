    <h1>Renewal of Strength, July 31</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they
          shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. <span class="ft36">Isaiah
          40:31</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>In order to fight successfully, a soldier must have courage and strength. Of ourselves, we are weak and feeble.
          But we have the promise, “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.”<a href="#page_440"><span
          class="ft43">73</span></a>Obstacles to the advancement of the work of God will appear; but fear not. To the
          omnipotence of the King of kings, our covenant- keeping God unites the gentleness and care of a tender
          shepherd. Nothing can stand in His way. His power is absolute, and it is the pledge of the sure fulfillment of
          His promises to His people. He can remove all obstructions to the advancement of His work. He has means for
          the removal of every difficulty, that those who serve Him and respect the means He employs may be delivered.
          His goodness</p>
      <p>and love are infinite, and His covenant is unalterable.</p>
      <p>The plans of the enemies of His work may seem to be firm and well established, but He can overthrow the
          strongest of these plans, and in His own time and way He will do this, when He sees that our faith has been
          sufficiently tested and that we are drawing near to Him and making Him our counselor.</p>
      <p>In the darkest days, when appearances seem so forbidding, fear not. Have faith in God. He is working out His
          will, doing all things well in behalf of His people. The strength of those who love and serve Him will be
          renewed day by day. His understanding will be placed at their service, that they may not err in the carrying
          out of His purposes.</p>
      <p>There is to be no despondency in God’s service. Our faith is to endure the pressure brought to bear upon it.
          God is able and willing to bestow upon His servants all the strength they need. He will more than fulfill the
          highest expectations of those who put their trust in</p>
