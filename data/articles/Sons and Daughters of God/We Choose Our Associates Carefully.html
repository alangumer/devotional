      <p><strong>Put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.</strong></p>
      <p>Numbers 6:27<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>God’s Word places great stress upon the influence of association, even upon men and women. How much greater is
          its power on the developing mind and character of children and youth. The company they keep, the principles
          they adopt, the habits they form, will de- cide the question of their usefulness here, and of their future,

          <nobr>object-lesson</nobr> given at the birth of the nation was of a nature deeply to impress all hearts.
          Before the last terrible judgment came upon the Egyptians in the death of the <nobr>first-born,</nobr> God
          commanded His people to gather their children into their own homes. The doorpost of every house was marked
          with blood, and within the protection assured by this token all were to abide. So today parents who love and
