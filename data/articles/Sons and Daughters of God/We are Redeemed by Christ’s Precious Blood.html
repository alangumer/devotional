    <h1>We are Redeemed by Christ’s Precious Blood,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>August 5</strong></p>
      <p>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with</p>
      <p>corruptible things, as silver and gold, ... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish
          and without spot.</p>
      <p>1 Peter 1:18, 19<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Every soul is precious, because it has been purchased by the precious blood of Jesus Christ.<a

      <p>Satan may whisper, “You are too great a sinner for Christ to save.” While you acknowledge that you are indeed
          sinful and unworthy, you may meet the tempter with the cry, “By virtue of the atonement, I claim Christ as my
          Saviour. I trust not to my own merits, but to the precious blood of Jesus, which cleanses me.”<a
          href="#page_441"><span class="ft32">10</span></a></p>
      <p>You cannot save yourself from the tempter’s power, but he trem- bles and flees when the merits of that precious
          blood are urged.<a href="#page_441"><span class="ft33">11</span></a></p>
      <p>The Lord loves you; He is dearer to you than any earthly tie, than any earthly object. Consider how preciously
          near you may keep to One who is your strength and efficiency. Live not in the shadow of the cross, but on the
          sunny side of the cross, where the Sun of righteousness may shine into your heart.<a href="#page_441"><span
          class="ft42">12</span></a></p>
      <p>We are to have free access to the atoning blood of Christ. This we must regard as the most precious privilege,
          the greatest blessing, ever granted to sinful man. And how little is made of this great gift! How deep, how
          wide and continuous is this stream. To every soul thirsting after holiness there is repose, there is rest,
          there is the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit, and then the holy, happy, peaceful walk and precious
          communion with Christ. Then, O then, can we intelligently say with John, “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh
          away the sin of the world.” Talk it, pray it. Let it be the theme of sacred <nobr>song,—to</nobr> be washed,
          to be cleansed; the believing soul claims that love, and by its virtues stands before the throne of God
          pardoned, justified, sanctified.... Its cleansing virtue gives strength and vigor to</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[225]</span><span class="ft34">faith, power to prayer, and happiness in cheerful
          obedience.</span><a href="#page_441"><span class="ft35">13</span></a></p>
