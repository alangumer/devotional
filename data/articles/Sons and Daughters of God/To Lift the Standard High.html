    <h1>To Lift the Standard High, July 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway;
          gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. <span class="ft36">Isaiah
          62:10</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Perplexities will increase; but let us, as believers in God, encour- age one another. Let us not lower the
          standard, but keep it lifted high, looking to Him who is the Author and the Finisher of our faith.<a
          href="#page_439"><span class="ft32">64</span></a></p>
      <p>We all need greater Christian courage, that we may uplift the standard on which is inscribed the commandments
          of God and the faith of Jesus. We are to make no compromise with the leaders of rebellion.... We must have a
          firm determination to do the Lord’s will</p>
      <p>at all times and in all places.<a href="#page_439"><span class="ft35">65</span></a></p>

          steadfastness of purpose, which the allurements of pleasure, the fickleness of custom, the contempt of the
          <nobr>world-loving</nobr> and the heart’s own clamors of <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> are powerless to
          influence.... We have marked illustrations of the</p>
      <p>sustaining power of firm, religious principle. Even the fear of death could not make the fainting David drink
          of the water of Bethlehem, to obtain which, valiant men had risked their lives. The gaping lions’ den could
          not keep Daniel from his daily prayers, nor could the fiery furnace induce Shadrach and his companions to fall
          down before the idol which Nebuchadnezzar set up. Young men who have firm principles will eschew pleasure,
          defy pain, and brave even the lions’ den and the heated fiery furnace rather than be found untrue to God.<a

      <p>Let it be written upon the conscience as with a pen of iron upon the rock, that real success, whether for this
          life or for the life to come, can be secured only by faithful adherence to the eternal principles of</p>
