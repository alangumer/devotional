    <h1>Withered Branch Apart From Christ, October 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast
          them into the fire, and they are burned. <span class="ft36">John 15:6</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>He [Judas] ... did not become transformed, and converted into a living branch through connection with the True
          Vine. This dry sapling adhered not to the Vine until it grew into a fruitful, living branch. He revealed that
          he was the graft that did not bear <nobr>fruit,—the</nobr> graft that did not, fiber by fiber and vein by
          vein, become knit with the Vine, and partake of its life.</p>
      <p>The dry, disconnected sapling can become one with the parent vine stock only by being made a partaker of the
          life and nourishment of the living vine, by being grafted into the vine, by being brought into the closest
          relationship possible.... The twig holds fast to the life-</p>
      <p>giving vine, until the life of the vine becomes the life of the branch, and it produces fruit like that of the
          vine.<a href="#page_452"><span class="ft42">26</span></a></p>
      <p>“I am the vine,” said Christ; “ye are the branches.” The closest possible connection is here represented.
          Engraft the leafless twig upon the flourishing vine stock, and it becomes a living branch, drawing sap and
          nourishment from the vine. Fiber by fiber, vein by vein, the sapling clings, until it buds and blossoms and
          bears fruit. The sapless twig represents the sinner. When united to Christ, soul is joined to soul, the feeble
          and finite to the holy and infinite, and man becomes one with Christ.<a href="#page_452"><span
          class="ft33">27</span></a></p>
      <p>The apparently dry branch, by being connected with the living vine, becomes a part of it.... The soul, dead in
          trespasses and sins,</p>
      <p>must experience a similar process.... As the graft receives life when</p>
      <p>united to the vine, so the sinner partakes of the divine nature when connected with Christ. Finite man is
          united with the infinite God. When thus united, the words of Christ abide in us, and we are not</p>
