    <h1>We Have Power Over the Nations, December 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him</strong></p>
      <p>will I give power over the nations. <span class="ft44">Revelation 2:26</span>.</p>
      <p>It was our Lord Himself who promised His disciples, “If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
          and receive you unto myself.” It was the compassionate Saviour, who, anticipating the loneliness and sorrow of
          His followers, commissioned angels to comfort them with the assurance that He would come again in person, even
          as He went into heaven. As the disciples stood gazing intently upward to catch the last glimpse of Him whom
          they loved, their attention was arrested by the words, “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
          this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go
          into heaven.” Hope was kindled afresh by the angel’s message. The disciples “returned to Jerusalem with great
          joy, and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.” They were not rejoicing because Jesus had
          been separated from them, and they were left to struggle with the trials and temptations of the world, but
          because of the angel’s assurance that He would come again.</p>
      <p>The proclamation of Christ’s coming should now be, as when made by the angels to the shepherds of Bethlehem,
          good tidings of great joy. Those who really love the Saviour cannot but hail with gladness the announcement
          founded upon the Word of God, that He in whom their hopes of eternal life are centered, is coming again, not
          to be insulted, despised, and rejected, as at His first advent, but in power and glory, to redeem His
          people.<a href="#page_463"><span class="ft42">50</span></a></p>
      <p>The gospel is to advance from conquest to conquest, from victory to victory. The greatness of the kingdom under
          the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, and they</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[367]</span><span class="ft34">shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever and
          ever.</span><a href="#page_463"><span class="ft35">51</span></a></p>
