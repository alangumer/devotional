      <p>For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh</p>
      <p>knowledge and understanding. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 2:6</span>.</p>
      <p>You need to seek constantly the highest culture of mind and soul, that you may bring to the education and
          training of your children a restful spirit, a loving heart; that you may imbue them with pure aspirations, and
          cultivate in them a love for things honest and pure and holy.... Seek constantly to improve your powers, that
          you may</p>
      <p>do the most perfect, thorough work at home, by both precept and example.<a href="#page_455"><span
          class="ft42">1</span></a></p>
      <p>You should not follow your own inclinations. You should be very careful to set a right example in all things.
          Do not be inactive. Arouse your dormant energies.... Take up the duties essential to be done.</p>
      <p>Study how to perform with alacrity the plain, uninteresting, homely, but most needful duties.<a

      <p>Parents have not yet aroused to understand the amazing power of Christian culture. There are mines of truth to
          be worked that have been strangely neglected. This careless indifference does not meet the approval of God.
          Parents, God calls upon you to look at this matter with anointed eyes. You have as yet only skimmed the
          surface. Take up your <nobr>long-neglected</nobr> work, and God will <nobr>co-operate</nobr> with you. Do your
          work with wholeheartedness, and God will help you to make improvement. Begin by bringing the gospel into the
          home life.<a href="#page_455"><span class="ft43">3</span></a></p>
      <p>The higher <nobr>soul-culture,</nobr> which gives purity and elevation to the thoughts and a spiritual
          fragrance to words and actions, requires careful, painstaking effort. It takes patience to keep every evil
          motive</p>
