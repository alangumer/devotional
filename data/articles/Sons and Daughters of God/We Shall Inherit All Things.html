    <h1>We Shall Inherit All Things, December 31</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son [daughter].
          <span class="ft45">Revelation 21:7</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>In order to inherit all things, we must resist and overcome sin.<a href="#page_464"><span
          class="ft32">63</span></a>We may have joy in the Lord if we will keep His commandments.</p>
      <p>If we indeed have our citizenship above, and a title to an immortal inheritance, an eternal substance, we have
          that faith which works by love and purifies the soul.... We are members of the heavenly</p>
      <p>family, children of the heavenly King, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. At His coming we shall have
          the crown of life that fadeth not away.<a href="#page_464"><span class="ft41">64</span></a></p>
      <p>The Monarch of heaven would have you possess and enjoy all that can ennoble, expand, and exalt your being and
          fit you to dwell with Him forever, your existence measuring with the life of God. What a prospect is the life
          which is to come! What charms it possesses! How broad and deep and measureless is the love of God manifested
          to man!<a href="#page_464"><span class="ft42">65</span></a></p>
      <p>The privileges granted to the children of God are without limit,â€” to be connected with Jesus Christ, who,
          throughout the universe of heaven and worlds that have not fallen, is adored by every heart, and His praises
          sung by every tongue; to be children of God, to bear His name, to become a member of the royal family; to be
          ranged under the banner of Prince Immanuel, the King of kings and Lord of lords.<a href="#page_464"><span
          class="ft43">66</span></a></p>
      <p>The Son of God was the heir of all things, and the dominion and glory of the kingdoms of this world were
          promised to Him.... Even</p>
      <p>as Christ was in the world, so are His followers. They are the sons of God, and joint heirs with Christ; and
          the kingdom and dominion belong to them.<a href="#page_464"><span class="ft41">67</span></a></p>
      <p>In place of the world, He will give you, for a life of obedience, the kingdom under the whole heavens. He will
          give you an eternal weight of glory and a life that is as enduring as eternity.<a href="#page_464"><span
