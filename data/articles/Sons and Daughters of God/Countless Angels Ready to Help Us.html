      <p><strong>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne ... and the number of them
          was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands. <span class="ft36">Revelation
          5:11</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>When Christ ascended to the Father, He did not leave His fol- lowers without help. The Holy Spirit, as His
          representative, and the heavenly angels, as ministering spirits, are sent forth to aid those who against great
          odds are fighting the good fight of faith. Ever remember that Jesus is your helper. No one understands as well
          as He your peculiarities of character. He is watching over you, and if you are willing to be guided by Him, He
          will throw around you influences for good that will enable you to accomplish all His will for you.<a

      <p>Nothing is apparently more helpless, yet really more invincible, than the soul that feels its nothingness and
          relies wholly on the merits of the Saviour. God would send every angel in heaven to the aid of such a one,
          rather than allow him to be overcome.<a href="#page_406"><span class="ft32">82</span></a></p>
      <p>Angels are God’s ministers, radiant with the light ever flowing from His presence, and speeding on rapid wing
          to execute His will.<a href="#page_406"><span class="ft43">83</span></a>Angels are ever present where they are
          most needed, with those who have the hardest battle with self to fight, and whose surroundings</p>
      <p>are the most discouraging.<a href="#page_406"><span class="ft35">84</span></a></p>
      <p>In all ages, angels have been near to Christ’s faithful followers. The vast confederacy of evil is arrayed
          against all who would over- come; but Christ would have us look to the things which are not seen, to the
          armies of heaven encamped about all who love God, to deliver them. From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have
          been preserved through the interposition of the angels, we shall never know, until in the light of eternity we
          see the providences of God. Then we shall know that the whole family of heaven was interested in the family
          here below, and that messengers from the throne of God attended our</p>
