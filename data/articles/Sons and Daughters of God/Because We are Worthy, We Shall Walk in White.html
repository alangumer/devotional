    <h1>Because We are Worthy, We Shall Walk in White,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>December 27</strong></p>
      <p>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in
          white: for they are worthy. <span class="ft36">Revelation 3:4</span>.</p>
      <p>When, as overcomers, we shall be “clothed in white raiment,” the Lord will acknowledge our faithfulness as
          verily as in the days of the early Christian church He acknowledged the “few names even in Sardis,” who had
          “not defiled their garments;” and we shall walk with Him in white, for through His atoning sacrifice we shall
          be accounted worthy....</p>
      <p>In view of these encouraging promises, how earnestly should we strive to perfect a character that will enable
          us to stand before the Son of God! Only those who are clothed in the garments of His righteousness will be
          able to endure the glory of His presence when He shall appear with “power and great glory.”</p>
      <p>It means much to be an overcomer. The besetments of the enemy and all his evil agencies must be firmly
          resisted. Every moment we must be on guard. Not for one instant are we to lose sight of Christ, and of His
          power to save in the hour of trial. Our hand must be placed in His, that we may be upheld by the power of His
          might.<a href="#page_463"><span class="ft43">54</span></a></p>
      <p>If you are to sit at Christ’s table, and feast on the provisions He has furnished at the marriage supper of the
          Lamb, you must have a special garment, called the wedding garment, which is the white robe of Christ’s
          righteousness. Every one who has on this robe is entitled to enter the city of God; and if Jesus had not been
          very desirous you should have a place in the mansions He has gone to prepare for those who love Him, He would
          not, at so great an expense to Himself, have made all these arrangements that you might be happy and sit at
          His table and enjoy the home He has gone to prepare for His redeemed</p>
