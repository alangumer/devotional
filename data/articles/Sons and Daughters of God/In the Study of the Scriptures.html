    <h1>In the Study of the Scriptures, May 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things
          concerning himself.</strong></p>
      <p>Luke 24:27<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>After Joseph and Mary had searched for Him [Christ] for three days, they found Him in the court of the temple,
          sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard Him were
          astonished at His understanding and answers. He asked His questions with a grace that charmed these learned
          men....</p>
      <p>His mother could not but mark His words, His spirit, His willing obedience to all her requirements.</p>
      <p>It is not correct to say, as many writers have said, that Christ was like all children. He was not like all
          children. Many children are misguided and mismanaged. But Joseph, and especially Mary, kept before them the
          remembrance of their child’s divine Fatherhood. Jesus was instructed in accordance with the sacred character
          of His mission. His inclination to right was a constant gratification to His parents.<a href="#page_424"><span

      <p>His intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures shows how dili- gently His early years were given to the study of
          God’s Word.<a href="#page_424"><span class="ft32">20</span></a></p>
      <p>Christ opened the Scriptures to His disciples, beginning at Moses and the prophets, and instructed them in all
          things concerning Himself, and also explained to them the prophecies.<a href="#page_424"><span
          class="ft33">21</span></a></p>
      <p>He pointed to the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority, and we should do the same.<a

      <p>Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did. As we try to be- come acquainted with our heavenly Father through
          His Word, angels will draw near, our minds will be strengthened, our characters will be elevated, and
          refined.<a href="#page_424"><span class="ft42">23</span></a></p>
      <p>Like Christ, we should be able to meet the enemy in time of</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[135]</span><span class="ft34">temptation with, “It is written.”</span><a
