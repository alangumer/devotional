      <p><strong>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and
          rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said,
          It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. <span

      <p>There are two ways to deal with <nobr>children,—ways</nobr> that differ widely in principle and in results.
          Faithfulness and love, united with wisdom and firmness, in accordance with the teachings of God’s Word, will
          bring happiness in this life and in the next. Neglect of duty, injudicious indulgence, failure to restrain or
          correct the follies of youth, will result in unhappiness and final ruin to the children, and disappointment

      <p>He [God] desires to see gathered out from the homes of our people a large company of youth who, because of the
          godly influences of their homes, have surrendered their hearts to Him and go forth to give Him the highest
          service of their lives. Directed and trained by the godly instruction of the home, the influence of the
          morning and evening worship, the consistent example of parents who love and fear God, they have learned to
          submit to God as their teacher and are prepared to render Him acceptable service as loyal sons and daughters.
