    <h1>Moab a Failure because He Refused to Change,</h1>

      <p><strong>March 31</strong></p>
      <p>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel
          to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not
          changed. <span class="ft36">Jeremiah 48:11</span>.</p>
      <p>A man may refuse to hear the counsels and admonitions of God. He may choose to take the regulating of his
          conduct into his own hands.... Like Moab, he refuses to be changed.... He refuses to correct</p>
      <p>his defective traits of character, although the Lord has plainly pointed out his work, his privileges, his
          opportunities, and the advancement to be made. It is too much trouble to break up his old ways, and transform
          his ideas and methods. “His taste remained in him.” He clings to his defects.<a href="#page_417"><span

      <p>There are many who are not satisfied with the work that God has given them. They are not satisfied to serve Him
          pleasantly in the place that He has marked out for them, or to do uncomplainingly the work that He has placed
          in their hands. It is right for us to be dissatisfied with the way in which we perform duty, but we are not to
          be dissatisfied with the duty itself, because ... in His providence God places before human beings service
          that will be as medicine for their diseased minds.... Some He places where relaxed discipline and</p>
      <p><nobr>over-indulgence</nobr> will not become their snare, where they are taught to appreciate the value of
          time, and to make the best and wisest use of it.</p>
      <p>There are some who desire to be a ruling power, and who need the sanctification of submission.... They are
          being qualified to fill places</p>
      <p>where their disciplined ability will make them of the greatest service. Some God trains by bringing to them
          disappointment and apparent failure. It is His purpose that they shall learn to master difficulty....</p>
      <p>Many are ignorant of how to work for God, not because they need to be ignorant, but because they are not
          willing to submit to His training process. Moab is spoken of as a failure because, the Word</p>
