      <p>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us. <span
          class="ft45">2 Corinthians 1:10</span>.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour came to this world to endure in human nature all the temptations wherewith man is beset. In His
          life He measured the power of the wily foe to deceive, to allure, and to destroy. As the Redeemer of the race,
          He warns humanity against seeking after those things that will lead away from the narrow path. He has cast up
          a glorious highway for those who are traveling toward the heav- enly mansions that He has gone to prepare for
          all who will prepare themselves to become members of the royal family....</p>
      <p>With His life Christ has purchased every human being. He died a cruel death to save human beings from eternal
          death. He gave His sinless life to obtain for the sinner a life that measures with the life of God. Through
          His death, He provided a way whereby man may break with Satan, return to his allegiance to God, and through
          faith in the Redeemer obtain pardon....</p>
      <p>He who has all power in heaven and earth will restore every repenting, believing soul. To as many as receive
          Him He gives power to become the sons of God. He has a deep interest in every soul, for He paid the price of
          His own life that no one should be eternally lost.<a href="#page_442"><span class="ft42">22</span></a></p>
      <p>Christ’s servants can and should be able to meet and overcome every temptation. They should say, “I am not my
          own; I have been bought with a price. By the infinite sacrifice Christ has made for me, He has put it out of
          my power to give Him more than He demands. All is His. He has purchased me, body, soul, and spirit. He calls
          for all my time, all my capabilities.”<a href="#page_442"><span class="ft42">23</span></a></p>
      <p>Those who receive Him and believe in Him become the spiritual children of God. They are adopted into the royal
          family, and as they</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[231]</span><span class="ft34">seek to do the will of God, they become conformed into His
          image.</span><a href="#page_442"><span class="ft35">24</span></a></p>
