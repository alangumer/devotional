    <h1>Influence of a Christian Life at Home, September 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He blesseth the habitation of the just. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 3:33</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>If we have Christ abiding with us, we shall be Christians at home as well as abroad. He who is a Christian will
          have kind words for his relatives and associates. He will be kind, courteous, loving, sym- pathetic, and will
          be educating himself for an abode with the family above. If he is a member of the royal family, he will
          represent the kingdom to which he is going. He will speak with gentleness to his children, for he will realize
          that they too are heirs of God, members of the heavenly court. Among the children of God no spirit of hardness
          dwells.<a href="#page_446"><span class="ft42">14</span></a></p>
      <p>Remember that just as you are in your family, so you will be in the church. Just as you treat your children, so
          will you treat Christ. If you cherish an <nobr>un-Christlike</nobr> spirit, you are dishonoring God....
          Position</p>
      <p>does not make the man. It is Christ formed within that makes a man worthy of receiving the crown of life, that
          fadeth not away.<a href="#page_446"><span class="ft42">15</span></a></p>
      <p>God wants every person to begin at home, and there live the <nobr>Christ-life.</nobr> In the church and in
          every business transaction a man will be just what he is in his home. If he submits to the Holy Spiritâ€™s
          guidance in the home, if he understands his responsibility to deal with minds there, then when in responsible
          positions he will pursue the same course. Remembering the tenderness of Christ toward him, he will manifest
          the same love and tenderness toward others....</p>
      <p>The principles of heaven are to be carried out in every family, in the discipline of every church, in every
          establishment, in every institution, in every school, and in everything that shall be managed.<a
          href="#page_446"><span class="ft54">16</span></a>Men and women, children and youth, are measured in the scales
          of heaven in accordance with that which they reveal in their home life.</p>
      <p>A Christian in the home is a Christian everywhere. Religion brought</p>

          measured.</span><a href="#page_446"><span class="ft35">17</span></a></p>
