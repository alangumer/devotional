    <h1>Righteous Church Members, September 12</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance
          for ever. <span class="ft30">Isaiah 32:17</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>“By their fruits ye shall know them.” The inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit is priceless. In the life
          of the true Christian the outward adorning is always in harmony with the inward peace and holiness. Thus in
          the righteousness of the members shall the church be established. God’s people are to show a faith steadfast
          and immovable. The Bible is their standard. Rich currents of grace from heaven will produce light in them,
          which they are to impart to others. In all its power the truth is to be proclaimed. Those who faithfully do
          this work, keeping the commandments of God in deed and in truth, will be acknowledged as laborers together
          with God.</p>
      <p>“The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.”
          From the beginning to the end of the history of the church, Christ will be to His people all that these words
          express, if they will heed the invitation, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, ... and
          learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,
          and my burden is light.” Christ is to His people life and strength, efficiency and power, wisdom and
          holiness.<a href="#page_447"><span class="ft43">30</span></a></p>
      <p>If you yield to the claims of God, and become permeated with His love, and filled with His fullness, children,
          youth, and young disciples will look to you for their impressions of what constitutes practical godliness; and
          you may thus be the means of leading them in the path of obedience to God. You will then be exerting an
          influence which will bear the test of God, and your work will be compared to gold, silver, and precious
          stones, for it will be of an imperishable nature....</p>
      <p>There are many who are looking to you, to see what religion can do for you. If you are faithful in your
          <nobr>God-given</nobr> work, you will make</p>
      <p>right impressions, and will lead souls in the way of righteousness.<a href="#page_447"><span
