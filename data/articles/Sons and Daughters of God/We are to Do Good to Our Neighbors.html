      <p>the power of thine hand to do it <span class="ft44">Proverbs 3:27</span>.</p>
      <p>So ready, so eager is the Saviour’s heart to welcome us as mem- bers of the family of God, that in the very
          first words we are to use in approaching God, He places the assurance of our divine relation-
          <nobr>ship,—“Our</nobr> Father.” ... In calling God our Father, we recognize all His children as our brethren.
          We are all a part of the great web of hu- manity, all members of one family. In our petitions we are to
          include our neighbors as well as ourselves. No one prays aright who seeks a blessing for himself alone.<a

      <p>We are bound to the Lord by the strongest ties, and the manifes- tation of our Father’s love should call forth
          the most filial affection and the most ardent gratitude. The laws of God have their foundation in the most
          immutable rectitude, and are so framed that they will promote the happiness of those who keep them.<a

      <p>In the lesson of faith that Christ taught on the mount, are revealed the principles of true religion. Religion
          brings man into personal relation with God, but not exclusively; for the principles of heaven are to be lived
          out, that they may help and bless humanity. A true child of God will love Him with all his heart, and his
          neighbor as himself. He will have an interest for his <nobr>fellow-men.</nobr> True religion is the work of
          grace upon the heart, that causes the life to flow out in good works, like a fountain fed from living streams.
          Religion does not consist merely in meditation and prayer. The Christian’s light is displayed in good works,
          and is thus recognized by others. Religion is not to be divorced from the business life. It is to pervade and
          sanctify its engagements and enterprises. If a man is truly connected with God and heaven, the spirit that
          dwells in heaven will influence all his words and actions. He will glorify God in his works, and will
          lead</p>
