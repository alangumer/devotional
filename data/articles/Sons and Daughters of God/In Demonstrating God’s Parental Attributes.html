    <h1>In Demonstrating God’s Parental Attributes, May 12</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them</strong></p>
      <p>that fear him. <span class="ft44">Psalm 103:13</span>.</p>
      <p>In all the gracious deeds that Jesus did, He sought to impress upon men the parental, benevolent attributes of
          God. In all His lessons He was seeking to teach men the wonderful truth that “God so loved the world, that he
          gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
          Jesus would have us understand the love of the Father, and He seeks to draw us to Him by presenting His
          parental grace. He would have the whole field of our vision filled with the perfection of God’s character. In
          His prayer for His disciples He says, “I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou
          gavest me to do. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.”</p>
      <p>Jesus came into the world to illustrate the character of God in His own life, and He swept back the
          misrepresentations that Satan had originated, and revealed the glory of God. It was only by living among men
          that He could reveal the mercy, compassion, and love of His heavenly Father; for it was only by actions of
          benevolence that He could set forth the grace of God. The unbelief of men was deep seated, and yet they could
          not resist the testimony of His <nobr>God-like</nobr> example, and His deeds of love and truth.<a

      <p>The bounties of God’s providence speak to every soul, confirming Christ’s testimony to the supreme goodness of
          His Father. The Lord would have His people realize that the blessings bestowed upon any object of creation are
          proportionate to the place that object occupies in the scale of creation. If even the wants of dumb animals
          are supplied, can we appreciate the blessings which God will bestow upon the</p>
