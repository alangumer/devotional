    <h1>Praise to God Brings Courage, July 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when he [Jehoshaphat] had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that
          should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his
          mercy endureth for ever. <span class="ft36">2 Chronicles 20:21</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>“And ... he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out
          before the army.” ... They praised God for the victory, and four days thereafter the army returned to
          Jerusalem, laden with the spoils of their enemies, singing praise for the victory won.</p>
      <p>Do you not think that if more of this were done now, our hope and courage and faith would be revived? Would not
          the hands of the soldiers who are standing in defense of the truth be strengthened? If there were much more
          praising the Lord, and far less doleful recitation of discouragement, many more victories would be
          gained.</p>
      <p>God is the eternal, uncreated Fountain of all good. All who trust in Him will find Him to be this. To those who
          serve Him, looking to Him as their heavenly Father, He gives the assurance that He will fulfil His promises.
          His joy will be in their hearts, and their joy will be full.</p>
      <p>It is our privilege to open our hearts, and let the sunshine of Christ’s presence in. My brother, my sister,
          face the light. Come into actual, personal contact with Christ, that you may exert an influence that is
          uplifting and reviving. Let your faith be strong and pure and steadfast. Let gratitude to God fill your
          hearts. When you rise in the morning, kneel at your bedside, and ask God to give you strength to fulfil the
          duties of the day, and to meet its temptations. Ask Him to help you to bring into your work Christ’s sweetness
          of character. Ask Him to help you to speak words that will inspire those around you</p>
