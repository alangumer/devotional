    <h1>He Was Obedient and Respectful, May 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things</strong></p>
      <p>which he suffered. <span class="ft44">Hebrews 5:8</span>.</p>
      <p>If you are seeking to reflect the life and character of Christ, you will be true and obedient to your parents.
          You will show your love for them by your willing obedience.<a href="#page_423"><span
          class="ft41">5</span></a></p>
      <p>No one can be truly good and great who has not learned to yield his will, first to his parents, and then to
          God, and to obey with alacrity. Those who learn to obey are the only ones who will be fitted to command.</p>
      <p>By learning the lessons of obedience, children are not only honor- ing their parents and lightening their
          burdens, but they are pleasing One higher in authority. “Honour thy father and thy mother” is a positive
          command. Children who treat their parents with disrespect, and disregard their wishes, not only dishonor them,
          but break the law of God. The earlier the will is made to yield to the will of the parents, and the more
          complete the submission, the less difficult it will be to yield to the requirements of God. And none can hope
          for the love and blessing of God who do not learn obedience to His commandments, and stand up firmly against
          temptation.<a href="#page_423"><span class="ft33">6</span></a></p>
      <p>His [Christ’s] life was characterized with firmness, yet He was ever respectful and obedient.<a
          href="#page_423"><span class="ft42">7</span></a></p>
      <p>He was a perfect pattern for all youth. Ever He manifested def- erence and respect for age. The religion of
          Jesus will never lead any child to be rude and uncourteous.<a href="#page_423"><span
          class="ft41">8</span></a></p>
      <p>The infinite Eye can search the heart, and read every defect in the character. He does not estimate youth by
          their outward appearance, but from the goodness they possess at heart, which can only be gained by
          watchfulness and prayer.... He marks their deportment to their</p>
      <p>parents and the family circle. If they are respectful, kind, affectionate, and truly polite, ... their
          characters are recorded in the books of</p>
