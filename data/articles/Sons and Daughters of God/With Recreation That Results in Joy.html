      <p><strong>But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou
          defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. <span class="ft36">Psalm

      <p>The enemy of righteousness has every kind of pleasure prepared for youth in all conditions of life; and they
          are not presented alone in crowded cities, but in every spot inhabited by human beings. Satan loves to secure
          the youth in his ranks as soldiers. The arch fiend well knows with what material he has to deal; and he has
          displayed his infernal wisdom in devising customs and pleasures for the youth which will separate their
          affections from Jesus Christ. The various amusements of society have been the ruin of thousands and tens of
          thousands who, had it not been for these attractions, would have been obedient children, respectful to their

      <p>Pride and ambition are never satisfied, but those who are truly wise will find substantial and elevating
          pleasure in the sources of enjoyment that God placed within the reach of all.<a href="#page_432"><span

      <p>It is the privilege and duty of Christians to seek to refresh their spirits and invigorate their bodies by
          innocent recreation, with the purpose of using their physical and mental powers to the glory of God. Our
          recreations should not be scenes of senseless mirth, taking the form of the nonsensical. We can conduct them
          in such a manner as will benefit and elevate those with whom we associate, and better qualify us and them to
          more successfully attend to the duties devolving upon us as Christians.... The religion of Christ is cheering
