    <h1>Now Is the Sealing Time, December 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in
          their foreheads. <span class="ft30">Revelation 7:3</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan is now using every device in this sealing time to keep the minds of God’s people from the present truth,
          and to cause them to waver. I saw a covering that God was drawing over His people to protect them in the time
          of trouble; and every soul that was decided on the truth, and was pure in heart, was to be covered with the
          covering of the Almighty. Satan knew this, and he was at work in mighty power to keep the minds of as many
          people as he possibly could wavering and unsettled on the truth.... I saw that Satan was at work ... to
          distract,</p>
      <p>deceive, and draw away God’s people, just now in this sealing time. I saw some who were not standing stiffly
          for present truth. Their knees were trembling, and their feet sliding because they were not firmly planted on
          the truth....</p>
      <p>Satan was trying his every art to hold them where they were, until the sealing was past, until the covering was
          drawn over God’s people, and they left without a shelter from the burning wrath of God, in the seven last
          plagues.<a href="#page_459"><span class="ft42">1</span></a></p>
      <p>We are brought out of the darkness of the world into God’s mar- velous light. If we receive the image of God,
          if our souls are cleansed from every moral defilement, the seal of God will be placed upon our foreheads, and
          we shall be prepared for the closing scenes of this earth’s history. But we have no time to lose. The more we
          study the life of Christ with a heart to learn, the more Christlike we become.<a href="#page_459"><span

      <p>The sealing time is very short, and will soon be over. Now is the time, while the four angels are holding the
          four winds, to make our</p>
