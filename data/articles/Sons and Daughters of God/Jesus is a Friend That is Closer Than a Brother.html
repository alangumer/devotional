      <p>There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. <span class="ft44">Proverbs</span></p>
      <p>18:24<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>Disappointments you will have, but ever bear in mind that Jesus, the living, risen Saviour, is your Redeemer,
          your Restorer. He loves you, and it is better to share His love than to sit with princes and be separated from
          Him....</p>
      <p>Come daily to Jesus, who loves you. Open your heart to Him freely. In Him there is no disappointment. You will
          never find a better counsellor, a safer guide, a more sure defense.<a href="#page_430"><span
          class="ft41">21</span></a></p>
      <p>Through all your trials ... you have had a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> Friend, who has said, “I am with you
          alway, even unto the end of the world.”<a href="#page_430"><span class="ft43">22</span></a>But how often is
          the Lord neglected for the society of others, and for things of no value! ... We dare not let His name
          languish on our lips, and His love and memory die out of our hearts. “Well,” says the cold, formal professor,
          “this is making Christ too much like a human being;” but the Word of God warrants us to have these very ideas.
          It is the want of these practical, definite views of Christ, that hinders so many from having a genuine
          experience in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. This is the reason that many are fearing and
          doubting and mourning. Their ideas of Christ and the plan of salvation are vague, dreary, and confused.... If
          ever there was a time</p>
      <p>when men needed the presence of Christ at their right hand, it is now, so that when the enemy shall come in
          like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.<a href="#page_430"><span
          class="ft41">23</span></a></p>
      <p>Communion with <nobr>Christ—how</nobr> unspeakably precious! Such com- munion it is our privilege to enjoy, if
          we will seek it.<a href="#page_430"><span class="ft42">24</span></a></p>
      <p>The everlasting assurance shall be yours that you have a Friend</p>
