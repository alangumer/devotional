    <h1>Sense of God’s Presence Banishes Fear, July 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with
          thee whithersoever thou goest. <span class="ft36">Joshua 1:9</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Only the sense of God’s presence can banish the fear that, for the timid child, would make life a burden. Let
          him fix in his memory the promise, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
          delivereth them.” Let him read that wonderful story of Elisha in the mountain city, and, between him and the
          hosts of armed foemen, a mighty encircling band of heavenly angels. Let him read how to Peter, in prison and
          condemned to death, God’s angel appeared; how, past the armed guards, the massive doors and great iron gateway
          with their bolts and bars, the angel led God’s servant forth in safety. Let him read of that scene on the sea,
          when to the <nobr>tempest-tossed</nobr> soldiers and seamen, worn with labor and watching and long fasting,
          Paul the prisoner, on his way to trial and execution, spoke those grand words of courage and hope: “Be of good
          cheer; for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you.... For there</p>
      <p>stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be
          brought before Caesar; and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.” In the faith of this
          promise Paul assured his companions, “There shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.” So it came to
          pass. Because there was in that ship one man through whom God could work, the whole <nobr>ship-load</nobr> of
          heathen soldiers and sailors was preserved....</p>
      <p>Let the <nobr>self-distrustful,</nobr> whose lack of <nobr>self-reliance</nobr> leads them to shrink from care
          and responsibility, be taught reliance upon God. Thus many a one who otherwise would be but a cipher in the
          world, perhaps only a helpless burden, will be able to say with the apostle</p>
