    <h1>Redemption Through the Riches of God’s Grace,</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>April 28</strong></p>
      <p>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
          wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. <span class="ft36">Ephesians 1:7,
          8</span>.</p>
      <p>He [Christ] came ... to elevate and ennoble our mental powers, so that our efforts in this life might not be
          misdirected and lost....</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus came to strengthen every earnest seeker for truth, He came to reveal the Father. He allowed
          nothing to divert His mind from the great work of restoring the moral image of God in man. And we must see
          that the great and important work for us is to receive the divine likeness, to prepare a character for the
          future life. We must appropriate the heavenly truths to our special use in practical life. And we may carry
          with us all the treasure of knowledge that gives us a fitness for the life that measures with the life of
          God.</p>
      <p>The knowledge of God is as high as the heaven, as broad as the earth.... Only those who read the Scriptures as
          the voice of God</p>
      <p>speaking to them are the true learners. They tremble at the Word of God; for to them it is a living reality.
          They study, they search for the hidden treasure. They open the understanding and heart to receive, and they
          pray for heavenly grace, that they may obtain a preparation for the future, immortal life. As the heavenly
          torch is placed in his hand, man sees his own frailty, his infirmity, his hopelessness in looking to himself
          for righteousness. He sees that in himself there is nothing to recommend him to God. He prays for the Holy
          Spirit, the representative of Christ, to be his constant guide, to lead him into all truth.... All knowledge
          gained in this life of probation which will fit</p>
      <p>us to be companions of the saints in light is true education. It brings blessings to ourselves and others in
          this life, and will secure to us the future, immortal life, with all its imperishable riches.<a
