    <h1>Divine Wisdom, June 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be</strong></p>
      <p>desired are not to be compared to it. <span class="ft44">Proverbs 8:11</span>.</p>
      <p>If Adam and Eve had never touched the forbidden tree, the Lord would have imparted to them
          <nobr>knowledge,—knowledge</nobr> upon which rested no curse of sin, knowledge that would have brought them
          everlasting joy. The only knowledge they gained by their disobedience was a knowledge of sin and its
          results....</p>
      <p>Age after age, the curiosity of men has led them to seek for the tree of knowledge; and often they think they
          are plucking fruit most essential, when, like Solomon’s research, they find it altogether vanity and
          nothingness in comparison with that science of true holiness which will open to them the gates of the city of
          God. The human ambition has been seeking for that kind of knowledge that will bring to them glory and
          <nobr>self-exaltation</nobr> and supremacy. Thus Adam and Eve were worked upon by Satan until God’s restraint
          was snapped asunder, and their education under the teacher of lies began in order that they might have the
          knowledge which God had refused them.<a href="#page_434"><span class="ft43">83</span></a></p>
      <p>True wisdom is a treasure as lasting as eternity. Many of the world’s <nobr>so-called</nobr> wise men are wise
          only in their own estimation. Content with the acquisition of worldly wisdom, they never enter the garden of
          God, to become acquainted with the treasures of knowledge contained in His holy Word. Supposing themselves to
          be wise, they are ignorant concerning the wisdom which all must have who gain eternal life.... The unlearned
          man, if he knows God and Jesus Christ,</p>
      <p>has a more enduring wisdom than has the most learned man who despises the instruction of God.<a
          href="#page_434"><span class="ft42">84</span></a></p>
      <p>Divine wisdom is to be a lamp to your feet.... Everything that can</p>
      <p>be shaken will be shaken; but rooted and grounded in the truth, you</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[184]</span><span class="ft34">will abide with those things that cannot be shaken.</span><a
