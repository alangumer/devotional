    <h1>Atonement Through Christ’s Blood, August 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we</strong></p>
      <p>have now received the atonement. <span class="ft44">Romans 5:11</span>.</p>
      <p>Thank God that He who spilled His blood for us, lives to plead it, lives to make intercession for every soul
          who receives Him. “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
          from all unrighteousness.” The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin.... We need to keep ever before
          us the efficacy</p>
      <p>of the blood of Jesus. That <nobr>life-cleansing,</nobr><nobr>life-sustaining</nobr> blood, appro- priated by
          living faith, is our hope. We need to grow in appreciation of its inestimable value, for it speaks for us only
          as we by faith claim its virtue, keeping the conscience clean and at peace with God. This is represented as
          the pardoning blood, inseparably connected with the resurrection and life of our Redeemer, illustrated by the
          <nobr>ever-flowing</nobr> stream that proceeds from the throne of God, the water of the river of life.<a

      <p>The wonderful symbol of the living bird dipped in the blood of the bird slain and then set free to its joyous
          life [<span class="ft51">Leviticus</span><nobr><span class="ft51">14:4-8</span>],</nobr> is to us the symbol
          of the atonement. There were death and life blended, presenting to the searcher for truth and hidden treasure,
          the union of the pardoning blood with the resurrection and life of our Redeemer. The bird slain was over
          living water; that flowing stream was a symbol of the ever flowing, ever cleansing efficacy of the blood of
          Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world....</p>
      <p>We are to have free access to the atoning blood of Christ. This we must regard as the most precious privilege,
          the greatest blessing, ever granted to sinful man.... How deep, how wide and continuous is this</p>
      <p>stream! To every soul thirsting after holiness there is repose, there is rest, there is the quickening
          influence of the Holy Spirit, and then the</p>
