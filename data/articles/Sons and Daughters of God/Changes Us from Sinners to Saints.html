    <h1>Changes Us from Sinners to Saints, April 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
          white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. <span class="ft30">Isaiah
          1:18</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>God is clothed with power; He is able to take those who are dead in trespasses and sins, and by the operation
          of the Spirit which raised Jesus from the dead, transform the human character, bringing back to the soul the
          lost image of God. Those who believe in Jesus Christ are changed from being rebels against the law of God into
          obedient servants and subjects of His kingdom. They are born again, regenerated, sanctified through the
          truth.<a href="#page_420"><span class="ft33">37</span></a></p>
      <p>The world is to see God in His followers. Life and immortality are brought to light through those who are one
          with God in Christ. It is our privilege to have the spirit of light and knowledge that is the wisdom of
          heaven. All who have this spirit, in whatever position they may be placed, the highest or the lowest place of
          service, will reveal in their work the power of this light and knowledge.</p>
      <p>Constantly we behold Him who lived among men a life of perfect obedience. The more closely we behold Him, the
          more nearly we shall resemble Him in character, and the greater will be our efficiency in working for others.
          We shall be lifted far above the trials and perplexities of this life.... Self is to be hidden. Christ alone
          is to</p>
      <p>appear, full of grace and truth....</p>
      <p>Heaven is to begin on this earth. When the Lordâ€™s people are filled with meekness and tenderness, they will
          realize that His banner over them is love, and His fruit will be sweet to their taste. They will make a heaven
          below in which to prepare for heaven above.<a href="#page_420"><span class="ft43">38</span></a></p>
      <p>He who receives Christ by living faith has a living connection with God.... He carries with him the atmosphere
          of heaven, which is</p>
      <p>the grace of God, a treasure that the world cannot buy.<a href="#page_420"><span
