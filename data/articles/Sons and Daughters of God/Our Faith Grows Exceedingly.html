    <h1>Our Faith Grows Exceedingly, November 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is</strong></p>
      <p>meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly. <span class="ft44">2</span></p>
      <p>Thessalonians 1:3<span class="ft11">.</span></p>
      <p>It is positively necessary for those who believe the truth, to be making continual advancement, growing up into
          the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. There is no time for backsliding and indifference. Each one
          must have a living experience in the things of God. Have root in yourselves. Become grounded in the faith, so
          that having done all you may stand, with unwavering confidence in God, through the time that will try every
          man’s work and character. Exercise your powers in spiritual things, till you can appreciate the deep things of
          God’s Word, and go on from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>There are thousands who claim to have the light of truth who take no steps in advance. They have no living
          experience, notwithstanding they have had every advantage.... The Word of God offers spiritual</p>
      <p>liberty and enlightenment to those who seek for it earnestly. Those who accept the promises of God, and act on
          them with living faith, will have the light of heaven in their lives. They will drink of the fountain of life,
          and lead others to the waters that have refreshed their own souls....</p>
      <p>The fruits of doubt are not desirable. Oh! look around you and see what havoc has been wrought by the ... evil
          one. Error and falsehood and heresy have held high carnival in the deceived hearts of men. From century to
          century the adversary has repeated his experiments with growing success; for, in spite of the sad records of
          lives that have gone out in darkness, as moths fly to the fire, so men rush on into the ruinous deceptions
          that he has prepared to entrap them.... “Heaven and</p>
      <p>earth shall pass away,” but “the word of the Lord endureth forever;” and unwavering faith in His Word is the
          only faith that will endure</p>
