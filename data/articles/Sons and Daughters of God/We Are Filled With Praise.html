      <p><strong>I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be</strong></p>
      <p>in my mouth. <span class="ft44">Psalm 34:1</span>.</p>
      <p>It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in contemplation of the life of Christ. We should
          take it point by point, and let the imagination grasp each scene, especially the closing ones. As we thus
          dwell upon His great sacrifice for us, our confidence in Him will be more constant, our love will be
          quickened, and we shall be more deeply imbued with His Spirit....</p>
      <p>As we associate together, we may be a blessing to one another. If we are Christ’s, our sweetest thoughts will
          be of Him. We shall love to talk of Him; and as we speak to one another of His love, our hearts will be
          softened by divine influences. Beholding the beauty of His character, we shall be “changed into the same image
          from glory to glory.”<a href="#page_459"><span class="ft42">62</span></a></p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus ... loves you. If you doubt His love, look to Calvary. The light reflected from the cross shows
          you the magnitude of that love which no tongue can tell....</p>
      <p>The mercies of God surround you every moment; and it would be profitable for you to consider how and whence
          your blessings come every day. Let the precious blessings of God awaken gratitude in you. You cannot number
          the blessings of God, the constant <nobr>loving-kindness</nobr> expressed to you, for they are as numerous as
          the refreshing drops of rain. Clouds of mercy are hanging over you, and ready to drop upon you. If you will
          appreciate the valuable gift of salvation, you will be sensible of daily refreshment, of the protection and
          love of Jesus; you will be guided in the way of peace....</p>
      <p>See Him, by the eye of faith, bending over you in love.... He</p>
      <p>wants you to live in His presence; to have eternal life and a crown of</p>
