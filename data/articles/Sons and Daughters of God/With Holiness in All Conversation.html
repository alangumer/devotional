    <h1>With Holiness in All Conversation, June 22</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all</strong></p>
      <p>manner of conversation. <span class="ft44">1 Peter 1:15</span>.</p>
      <p>Where the heart is purified and refined, and made fit for the in- dwelling of the Holy Spirit, the tongue will
          be sanctified to the glory of God.... You can surround your souls with an atmosphere that will</p>
      <p>be like breezes from the heavenly Eden. Open your heart to the Lord Jesus. Guard your tongue. Let not your
          tongue run at random in jest- ing and joking. These are signs that your heart needs to be cleansed from its
          defilement....</p>
      <p>Our words index the state of our heart; and whether men talk much or little, their words express the character
          of their thoughts. A manâ€™s character may be quite accurately estimated by the nature of his conversation.
          Sound, truthful words have the right ring in them.<a href="#page_433"><span class="ft33">75</span></a>Educate
          yourself to carry a pleasant countenance, and bring all</p>
      <p>the sweetness and melody possible into your voice.<a href="#page_433"><span class="ft35">76</span></a></p>
      <p>The voice and tongue are gifts from God, and if rightly used, they are a power for God. Words mean very much.
          They may express love, devotion, praise, melody to God, or hatred and revenge. Words reveal the sentiments of
          the heart. They may be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. The tongue is a world of blessing, or
          a world of iniquity.</p>
      <p>Some are seen to come forth from their daily communion with God clothed with the meekness of Christ. Their
          words are not like a desolating hail, crushing everything before it; they come forth sweetly from their lips.
          They scatter seeds of love and kindness all along their path, and that all unconsciously, because Christ lives
          in their heart.</p>
