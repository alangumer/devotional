    <h1>The Law is Holy, Just, and Good, February 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,</strong></p>
      <p>and good. <span class="ft44">Romans 7:12</span>.</p>
      <p>As the Supreme Ruler of the universe, God has ordained laws for the government not only of all living beings,
          but of all the operations of nature. Everything, whether great or small, animate or inanimate, is under fixed
          laws which cannot be disregarded. There are no excep- tions to this rule; for nothing that the divine hand has
          made has been forgotten by the divine mind.... To man alone, the crowning work of</p>
      <p>His creation, God has given a conscience to realize the sacred claims of the divine law, and a heart capable of
          loving it as holy, just, and good; and of man prompt and perfect obedience is required.<a
          href="#page_407"><span class="ft33">10</span></a></p>
      <p>This rule forbids all oppression from parents and all disobedience from children. The Lord is full of
          lovingkindness, mercy, and truth. His law is holy, just, and good, and must be obeyed by parents and children.
          The rules which should regulate the lives of parents and children flow from a heart of infinite love, and
          God’s rich blessing will rest upon those parents who administer His law in their homes, and upon the children
          who obey this law. The combined influence of mercy and justice is to be felt. “Mercy and truth are met
          together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.” Households under this discipline will walk in the
          way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.<a href="#page_407"><span class="ft33">11</span></a></p>
      <p>Let the youth look upon the divine standard, and never be content with a low aim.... Walk not hesitatingly, but
          firmly in the strength and</p>
      <p>grace of Jesus Christ. Unto Him is committed all power in heaven and in earth. Take refuge in Jesus Christ, and
          enter into a firm covenant with Him in faith, to love and serve Him.<a href="#page_407"><span
          class="ft42">12</span></a></p>
      <p>Since the law of God is “holy, and just, and good,” a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a
          character formed by obedience to that law will be holy. Christ is the perfect example of such a</p>
