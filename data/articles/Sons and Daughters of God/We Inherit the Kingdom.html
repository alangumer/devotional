    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
          <span class="ft30">Matthew 25:34</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>Every action of ours in befriending God’s people will be rewarded as done unto Himself.</p>
      <p>In the day of final reckoning, Christ does not present before men the great work He has done for them in giving
          His life for their redemption. He presents before them the faithful work they have done for Him. What
          surpassing love is this! He even mentions the work of the heathen, who have no intelligent knowledge of the
          law of the Lord, but who have done the very things the law required, because they have heeded the voice
          speaking to them in the things of nature. When the Holy Spirit implants Christ’s Spirit in the heart of the
          savage, and he befriends God’s servants, the quickening of the heart’s sympathy is contrary to his nature,
          contrary to his education. The grace of God, working upon the darkened mind, has softened the savage nature
          untaught by the wisdom of men....</p>
      <p>Christ implants His grace in the heart of the savage, and he min- isters to the necessity of the missionary,
          even before he has heard or comprehended the words of truth and life. Behold that crowd col- lected about
          God’s servant to harm him! But the Lord is working upon the heart and mind of perhaps one man to plead in
          behalf of His servant; and when the war council has determined the destruction of the Christian’s life, the
          intercession of that savage turns the decision, and his life is spared. O, the love that goes forth to the
          savage for this one act! To such Christ says, in the Judgment: “I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was
          thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and
          ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.” “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
          prepared for you from the</p>
