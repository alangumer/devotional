      <p><strong>Thou shalt not commit adultery. <span class="ft44">Exodus 20:14</span>.</strong></p>
      <p>This commandment forbids not only acts of impurity, but sensual thoughts and desires, or any practice that
          tends to excite them. Purity is demanded not only in the outward life, but in the secret intents and emotions
          of the heart. Christ, who taught the <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> obligation of the law of God, declared the evil
          thought or look to be as truly sin as is the unlawful deed.<a href="#page_411"><span
          class="ft42">70</span></a></p>
      <p>When the thought of evil is loved and cherished, however secretly, said Jesus, it shows that sin still reigns
          in the heart. The soul is still in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. He who finds pleasure
          in dwelling upon scenes of impurity, who indulges the evil thought, the lustful look, may behold in the open
          sin, with its burden of shame and heartbreaking grief, the true nature of the evil which he has hidden in the
          chambers of the soul. The season of temptation, under which, it may be, one falls into grievous sin, does not
          create the evil that is revealed, but only develops or makes manifest that which was hidden and latent in the
          heart. As a man “thinketh in his heart, so is he”; for out of the heart “are the issues of life.”<a
          href="#page_411"><span class="ft43">71</span></a>The heart in which Christ dwells, will be so filled, so
          satisfied, with His love that it will not be consumed with longing to attract sympathy and attention to
          itself. And through the surrender of the soul to God, His wisdom can accomplish what human wisdom fails to
          do.<a href="#page_411"><span class="ft43">72</span></a></p>
      <p>So long as life shall last, there will be need of guarding the affec- tions and the passions with a firm
          purpose. Not one moment can we be secure except as we rely upon God, the life hidden with Christ.<a
          href="#page_411"><span class="ft54">73</span></a>The nearer we live to Jesus, the more will we partake of His
          pure and holy character; and the more offensive sin appears to us, the more</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[63]</span><span class="ft34">exalted and desirable will appear the purity and brightness of
          Christ.</span><a href="#page_411"><span class="ft35">74</span></a></p>
