    <h1>The Dangerous Seeds of Doubt, April 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he</strong></p>
      <p>should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Numbers.23.19"><span class="ft46">Numbers 23:19</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Those who are perpetually talking doubts and demanding additional evidence to banish their cloud of unbelief do
          not build on the Word. Their faith rests on circumstances; it is founded in feeling. But feeling, be it ever
          so pleasing, is not faith. God’s Word is the foundation upon which our hopes of heaven must be built.</p>
      <p>It is a great misfortune to be a chronic doubter, keeping the eye and thoughts on self. While you are beholding
          self, while this is the theme of thought and conversation, you cannot expect to be conformed to the image of
          Christ. Self is not your saviour. You have no redeeming qualities in yourself. “I” is a very leaky boat for
          your faith to embark in. Just as surely as you trust yourself in it, it will founder. The lifeboat, to the
          lifeboat! This is your only safety. Jesus is the captain of the lifeboat, and He has never lost a
          passenger.</p>
      <p>We need a more heavenly atmosphere to surround our souls. We need to have our lips touched with a live coal
          from off the altar. We need to hear the word from Christ, “Be thou clean.” If we have scattered darkness, if
          we have accumulated rubbish and hoarded doubts, if we have planted seeds of doubt and discouragement in the
          minds of others, may God help us to see our sin. We cannot afford to drop a single word of doubt, for it will
          germinate and grow and bring forth a bitter harvest. We should take heed to the exhortation, “Be ye holy in
          all manner of conversation” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.1.15"><span class="ft21">1
          Peter 1:15</span></a>). One seed of doubt sown, and it is beyond the power of man to kill it. God alone can
          pluck it from the soul....</p>
      <p>The great field of the promises of God has been presented before us, and by these we are to lay hold of faith,
          hope, and love. In these graces the church may shine forth and present to the world a living representation of
          the righteousness of Christ. Living faith grasps the hand of divine power, and faith is as an anchor to the
          soul, sure and steadfast.... John says, “This</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[107]</span><span class="ft27">is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith”
          (</span><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.5.4"><span class="ft9">1 John
          5:4</span></a>).</p>
