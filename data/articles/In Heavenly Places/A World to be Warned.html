    <h1>A World to be Warned, November 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and
          then shall the end come. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.24.14"><span class="ft6">Matthew
          24:14</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>As the rays of the sun penetrate to the remotest corners of the globe, so God designs that the light of the
          gospel shall extend to every soul upon the earth.... At this time, when the enemy is working as never
          before</p>
      <p>to engross the minds of men and women, we should be laboring with increasing activity. Diligently,
          disinterestedly, we are to proclaim the last message of mercy in the <nobr>cities—in</nobr> the highways and
          byways. All classes are to be reached. As we labor we shall meet with different nationalities. None are to be
          passed by unwarned. The Lord Jesus was the gift of God to the entire <nobr>world—not</nobr> to the higher
          classes alone, and not to one nationality, to the exclusion of others. His saving grace encircles the world.
          Whosoever will, may drink of the water of life. A world is waiting to hear the message of present
          truth....</p>
      <p>The kingdom of grace is now being established as day by day hearts that have been full of sin and rebellion
          yield to the sovereignty of His love. But the full establishment of the kingdom of His glory will not take
          place till the second coming of Christ to this world. “The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the
          kingdom under the whole heaven” is to “be given to the people of the saints of the most High” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Daniel.7.27"><span class="ft21">Daniel 7:27</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>The heavenly gates are again to be lifted up, and with ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of
          thousands of holy ones, our Saviour will come forth as “King of kings, and Lord of lords” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Timothy.6.15"><span class="ft10">1 Timothy 6:15</span></a>).
          Jehovah Immanuel “shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Zechariah.14.9"><span class="ft10">Zechariah 14:9</span></a>). “The
          tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, ... and be their God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.21.3"><span class="ft10">Revelation
          21:3</span></a>).</p>
      <p>But before that coming, Jesus said, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
          witness unto all nations.” His kingdom will not come until the good tidings of His grace shall have been
          carried</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[341]</span><span class="ft27">to all the earth.</span></p>
