    <h1>Fervent Prayer, March 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him:</strong></p>
      <p>God is a refuge for us. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.62.8"><span class="ft9">Psalm
          62:8</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye of faith will discern God very near, and the
          suppliant may obtain precious evidence of the divine love and care for him. But why is it that so many prayers
          are never answered? ... The Lord gives us the promise: “Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search
          for me with all your heart” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Jeremiah.29.13"><span
          class="ft21">Jeremiah 29:13</span></a>). Again, He speaks of some who “have not cried unto me with their
          heart” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hosea.7.14"><span class="ft21">Hosea 7:14</span></a>).
          Such petitions are prayers of form, lip service only, which the Lord does not accept....</p>
      <p>There is need of <nobr>prayer—most</nobr> earnest, fervent, agonizing <nobr>prayer—such</nobr> prayer as David
          offered when he exclaimed: “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.”
          “I have longed after thy precepts”; “I have longed for thy salvation.” “My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth
          for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.” “My soul breaketh for the
          longing that it hath unto thy judgments” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.42.1"><span
          class="ft10">Psalm 42:1</span></a>; <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.119.40"><span
          class="ft10">119:40, 174</span></a>; <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.84.2"><span
          class="ft10">Psalm 84:2</span></a>; <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.119.20"><span
          class="ft10">119:20</span></a>). This is the spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal
          psalmist....</p>
      <p>Of Christ it is said: “And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.22.44"><span class="ft10">Luke 22:44</span></a>). In what
          contrast to this intercession by the Majesty of heaven are the feeble, heartless prayers that are offered to
          God. Many are content with lip service, and but few have a sincere, earnest, affectionate longing after
          God.</p>
      <p>Communion with God imparts to the soul an intimate knowledge of His will.... True prayer engages the energies
          of the soul and affects the</p>
      <p>life. He who thus pours out his wants before God feels the emptiness of everything else under heaven. “All my
          desire is before thee,” said David, “and my groaning is not hid from thee.” “My soul thirsteth for
          God....”</p>
      <p>“When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.38.9"><span class="ft10">Psalm 38:9</span></a>; <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.42.2"><span class="ft10">42:2, 4</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Your prayers may rise with an importunity that will not accept denial.</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[74]</span><span class="ft27">That is faith.</span></p>
