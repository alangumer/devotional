    <h1>The Highest Culture, May 14</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth</strong></p>
      <p>understanding. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.3.13"><span class="ft9">Proverbs
          3:13</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the man who consents to be molded and fashioned after the
          divine similitude is the noblest specimen of the work of God....</p>
      <p>The experimental knowledge of true godliness, in daily consecration and service to God, ensures the highest
          culture of the mind, soul, and body.... The impartation of divine power honors our sincere striving after</p>
      <p>wisdom for the conscientious use of our highest faculties to honor God and bless our fellow men. As these
          faculties are derived from God, and not <nobr>self-created,</nobr> they should be appreciated as talents from
          God to be employed in His service.</p>
      <p>The <nobr>Heaven-entrusted</nobr> faculties of the mind are to be treated as the higher powers, to rule the
          kingdom of the body. The natural appetites and passions are to be brought under the control of the conscience
          and the spiritual affections....</p>
      <p>The religion of Jesus Christ never degrades the receiver; it never makes him coarse or rough, discourteous or
          <nobr>self-important,</nobr> passionate or hardhearted. On the contrary, it refines the taste, sanctifies the
          judgment, purifies and ennobles the thoughts by bringing them into captivity to Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>God’s ideal for His children is higher than the highest human thought can reach. The living God has given in
          His holy law a transcript of His character. The greatest Teacher the world has ever known is Jesus Christ. And
          what is the standard He has given for all who believe in Him to reach? “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
          Father which is in heaven is perfect” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.5.48"><span
          class="ft19">Matthew 5:48</span></a>). As God is perfect in His high sphere of action, so man may be perfect
          in his human sphere. The ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. There is opened before us a path of
          continual advancement. We have an object to reach, a standard to gain which includes everything good and pure
          and noble and elevated. There should be continual striving</p>
      <p>and constant progress onward and upward toward perfection of character. <span class="ft45">[142]</span></p>
