    <h1>The “Why” of Temptation, September 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not
          suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that
          ye may be able to bear it. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.10.13"><span
          class="ft6">1 Corinthians 10:13</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>What is temptation? It is the means by which those who claim to be the children of God are tested and tried. We
          read that God tempted Abraham, that He tempted the children of Israel. This means that He permitted
          circumstances to occur to test their faith and lead them to look to Him for help. God permits temptation to
          come to His people today that they may realize that He is their helper. If they draw nigh to Him when they are
          tempted, He strengthens them to meet the temptation....</p>
      <p>Temptations will pour in upon us, for by them we are to be tried during our probation. This is the proving of
          God, the revelation of our own hearts. There is no sin in having temptation, but sin comes in when temptation
          is yielded to....</p>
      <p>Abraham certified his obedience to God when, with Isaac by his side, he journeyed on his way in response to the
          command, “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and
          offer him there for a burnt offering ...” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Genesis.22.2"><span
          class="ft10">Genesis 22:2</span></a>). Job was permitted to suffer; he was severely tempted; but he would not
          speak one word against God. During Christ’s life on earth the scribes and Pharisees, instigated by Satan,
          tempted Him in every possible way. But He never allowed these temptations to lead Him from the path of
          obedience....</p>
      <p>Christ’s example shows us that our only hope of victory is in continual resistance of Satan’s attacks. He who
          triumphed over the adversary of souls in the conflict with temptation understands Satan’s power over the race,
          and has conquered in our behalf. As an overcomer, He has given us the advantage of His victory, that in our
          efforts to resist the temptations of Satan we may unite our weakness to His strength, our worthlessness to His
          merits. And sustained by His enduring might, under strong temptation,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[252]</span><span class="ft27">we may resist in His</span><nobr>all-powerful</nobr> name and
          overcome as He overcame.</p>
