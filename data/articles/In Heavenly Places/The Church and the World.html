      <p><strong>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
          is not of the Father, but is of the world.</strong></p>
      <p>And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth</p>
      <p>the will of God abideth for ever. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.2.16"><span class="ft9">1
          John 2:16, 17</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Many who profess to believe the Word of God do not seem to under- stand the deceptive working of the enemy.
          They do not realize that the end of time is near, but Satan knows it, and while men sleep he works. The lust
          of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life are controlling men and women. Satan is at work even
          among the people of God, to cause disunion. Selfishness, corruption, and evil of every kind are taking a firm
          hold upon hearts. With many the precious Word of God is neglected. A novel or a storybook engages the
          attention.... That which excites the</p>
      <p>imagination is eagerly devoured, while the Word of God is set aside. The world is the chief enemy of religion;
          for satanic forces are con-</p>
      <p>tinually at work through the world, and it is the object of Satan to bring the church and the world into such
          close fellowship that their aims, their spirit, their principles, shall harmonize, and that it will be
          impossible to distinguish between him who professes to serve God and him who serveth Him not. The enemy works
          continually to push the world to the front.</p>
      <p>The command is given, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate.” But it is not for you to say, I have
          nothing to do with my neighbor. He is buried in the world; I am not his keeper. For this very reason you
          should have something to say to him. The light given you, you are not to hide under a bushel.... It may be
          understood that you believe</p>
      <p>the seventh day is the Sabbath, that you believe in the Lord’s soon return, but what good will this do your
          neighbor unless you carry your belief into your daily life? ... A pure example will do more to enlighten the
          world than all your profession....</p>
      <p>How many there are as weak as water who might have a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> source of strength. Heaven is
          ready to impart to us that we may be mighty</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[310]</span><span class="ft27">in God and attain to the full stature of men and women in
          Christ Jesus.</span></p>
