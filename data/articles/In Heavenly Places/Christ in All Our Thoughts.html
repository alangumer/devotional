    <h1>Christ in All Our Thoughts, June 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my</strong></p>
      <p>thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in</p>
      <p>the way everlasting. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.139.23"><span class="ft9">Psalm 139:23,
          24</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Few realize that it is a duty to exercise control over the thoughts and imaginations. It is difficult to keep
          the undisciplined mind fixed upon profitable subjects. But if the thoughts are not properly employed, religion
          cannot flourish in the soul. The mind must be preoccupied with sacred and eternal things, or it will cherish
          trifling and superficial thoughts. Both the intellectual and the moral powers must be disciplined, and they
          will ...</p>
      <p>improve by exercise.</p>
      <p>In order to understand this matter aright, we must remember that our hearts are naturally depraved, and we are
          unable of ourselves to pursue a right course. It is only by the grace of God, combined with the most earnest
          effort on our part, that we can gain the victory. The intellect, as well as the heart, must be consecrated to
          the service of God. He has claims upon all there is of us.</p>
      <p>Few believe that humanity has sunk so low as it has or that it is so thoroughly bad, so desperately opposed to
          God, as it is.... When the mind</p>
      <p>is not under the direct influence of the Spirit of God, Satan can mold it as he chooses. All the rational
          powers which he controls he will carnalize. He is directly opposed to God in his tastes, views, preferences,
          likes and dislikes, choice of things and pursuits; there is no relish for what God loves or approves, but a
          delight in those things which He despises....</p>
      <p>If Christ is abiding in the heart, He will be in all our thoughts. Our deepest thoughts will be of Him, His
          love, His purity. He will fill all the chambers of the mind. Our affections will center about Jesus. All our
          hopes and expectations will be associated with Him. To live the life we now live by faith in the Son of God,
          looking forward to and loving His appearing, will be the soulâ€™s highest joy. He will be the crown of our
          rejoicing.</p>
      <p>Those who have trained the mind to delight in spiritual exercises are the ones who can be translated and not be
          overwhelmed with the purity</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[164]</span><span class="ft27">and transcendent glory of heaven.</span></p>
