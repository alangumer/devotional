    <h1>Feelings Not a Test, April 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he</strong></p>
      <p>is faithful that promised). <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.10.23"><span
          class="ft9">Hebrews 10:23</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The religion of Christ is not a religion of mere emotion. You cannot depend upon your feelings for an evidence
          of acceptance with God, for feelings are variable. You must plant your feet on the promises of God’s Word ...
          and learn to live by faith.</p>
      <p>As soon as one begins to contemplate his feelings he is on dangerous ground. If he feels happy and joyous, then
          he is very confident and has very pleasing emotions. The change will come. There are circumstances that occur
          which bring depression and sad feelings; then the mind will naturally begin to doubt whether the Lord is with
          him or not.</p>
      <p>Now, the feelings must not be made the test of the spiritual state, be they good or be they discouraging. The
          word of God is to be our evidence of our true standing before Him. Many are bewildered on this point....</p>
      <p>If you confess your sins, believe they are pardoned, because the promise is positive. “If we confess our sins,
          he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.1.9"><span class="ft21">1 John 1:9</span></a>). Why, then,
          dishonor God by doubting His pardoning love? Having confessed your sins, believe that the word of God will not
          fail, but that He is faithful that hath promised. It is just as much your duty to believe that God will
          fulfill His word and forgive your sins as it is your duty to confess your sins. Your faith must be exercised
          in God as one who will do just as He has said He would <nobr>do—pardon</nobr> all your transgressions....</p>
      <p>Oh, how very many go mourning, sinning and repenting, but always under a cloud of condemnation! They do not
          believe the word of the Lord. They do not believe that He will do just as He said He would do.... You</p>
      <p>hurt the heart of Christ by doubting, when He has given us such evidences of His love in giving His own life to
          save us that we should not perish but have everlasting life.</p>
      <p>We must trust; we must educate and train our souls to believe the word</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[127]</span><span class="ft27">of God implicitly.</span></p>
