    <h1>Day of Delight and Blessing, May 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy</strong></p>
      <p>pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour
          him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou
          delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
          with the heritage of Jacob thy father. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.58.13"><span

      <p>The Sabbath ... is God’s time, not ours; when we trespass upon it we are stealing from God.... God has given us
          the whole of six days in which</p>
      <p>to do our work, and has reserved only one to Himself. This should be a day of blessing to <nobr>us—a</nobr> day
          when we should lay aside all our secular matters and center our thoughts upon God and heaven.</p>
      <p>But while we worship God, we are not to consider this a drudgery. The Sabbath of the Lord is to be made a
          blessing to us and to our children. They are to look upon the Sabbath as a day of delight, a day which God has
          sanctified; and they will so consider it if they are properly instructed....</p>
      <p>They can be pointed to the blooming flowers and the opening buds, the lofty trees and beautiful spires of
          grass, and taught that God made all these in six days and rested on the seventh day and hallowed it. Thus the
          parents may bind up their lessons of instruction to their children so that when these children look upon the
          things of nature they will call to mind the great Creator of them all....</p>
      <p>We are not to teach our children that they must not be happy on the Sabbath, that it is wrong to walk out of
          doors. Oh, no. Christ led His disciples out by the lakeside on the Sabbath day and taught them. His sermons on
          the Sabbath were not always preached within enclosed walls....</p>
      <p>Many say they would keep the Sabbath if it were convenient to do so. But this day is not yours; it is God’s
          day, and you have no more right to take it than you have to steal my purse. God has reserved it, sanctified
          and blessed it; and it is your duty to devote this time to His service, to</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[153]</span><span class="ft27">make it honorable, to call it a delight.</span></p>
