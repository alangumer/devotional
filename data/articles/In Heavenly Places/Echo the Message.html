    <h1>Echo the Message, November 28</h1>

      <p><strong>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
          come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.22.17"><span class="ft6">Revelation
          22:17</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>A short time before His ascension to His heavenly throne Christ commissioned His disciples to go into all the
          world as teachers of righ- teousness.... Among the believers to whom the commission was given,</p>
      <p>were many from the humbler walks of <nobr>life—men</nobr> and women who had learned to love their Lord and who
          had determined to follow His example of <nobr>self-denying</nobr> service. To these lowly ones of but limited
          talent, as well as to the disciples who had been with the Saviour during the years of His earthly ministry,
          was the commission given to go “into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Mark.16.15"><span class="ft21">Mark 16:15</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>To the members of the early Christian church was given a sacred trust. They were to be executors of the will in
          which Christ had bequeathed to the world the treasure of life eternal.... In the trust given to the first
          disciples</p>
      <p>believers in every age have shared. God desires that every believer shall be an executor of the Saviour’s
          will.... The unselfish labor of God’s people</p>
      <p>in ages past is to His servants today an object lesson and an inspiration. Today God’s chosen people are to be
          zealous of good works, separating from all worldly ambition and walking humbly in the footsteps of the lowly
          Nazarene....</p>
      <p>“The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.” This commission to bid others come,
          embraces the entire church, and applies to every one who has accepted Christ as his personal Saviour....</p>
      <p>Every soul who has heard the divine invitation is to echo the message..., saying to those with whom he comes in
          contact, “Come.” From the moment of conversion those who receive Christ are to become the light of the
          world....</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit, Christ’s representative, arms the weakest with might to press forward to victory.... The work
          that some are able to do may</p>
      <p>appear to be restricted by circumstances; but wherever it is, if performed</p>
      <p>with faith and diligence, it will be felt to the uttermost parts of the earth. <span
