      <p><strong>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God
          acceptably with reverence and godly fear. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.12.28"><span
          class="ft6">Hebrews 12:28</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>A life of monotony is not the most conducive to spiritual growth. Some can reach the highest standard of
          spirituality only through a change in the regular order of things. When in His providence God sees that
          changes are essential for the success of the character building, He disturbs the smooth current of the
          life....</p>
      <p>God sees that a worker needs to be more closely associated with Him; and to bring this about, He separates him
          from friends and acquaintances. When He was preparing Elijah for translation He moved him from place to place
          that he might not settle down at ease and thus fail of obtaining spiritual power. And it was God’s design that
          Elijah’s influence should be a power to help many....</p>
      <p>Let those who are not permitted to rest in quietude, who must be continually on the move, pitching their tent
          tonight in one place and tomorrow night in another place, remember that the Lord is leading them and that this
          is His way of helping them to form perfect characters. In all the changes that we are required to make, God is
          to be recognized as our companion, our guide, our dependence....</p>
      <p>Many are ignorant of how to work for God, not because they need to be ignorant, but because they are unwilling
          to submit to His training. Moab is spoken of as a failure because, the prophet declares, “Moab hath been at
          ease from his youth, ... and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity:
          therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Jeremiah.48.11"><span class="ft10">Jeremiah 48:11</span></a>). Thus
          it is with those whose hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong are not purged from them....</p>
      <p>The Christian is to be prepared for the doing of a work that reveals kindness, forbearance,
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, patience. The cultiva- tion of these precious gifts is to come into
          the life of the Christian, that, when called into service by the Master, he may be ready to use his
          highest</p>
