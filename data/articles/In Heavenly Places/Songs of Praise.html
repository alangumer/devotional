    <h1>Songs of Praise, March 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; many shall see it, and fear, and
          shall trust in the Lord. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.40.3"><span class="ft6">Psalm
          40:3</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>I have thought with what joy the angels would look down from heaven upon us if we were all praising God and
          abiding in Christ. If, indeed, there is joy to the full for the Christian, why should we not possess it, and
          manifest it to the world? ...</p>
      <p>In just a little time Christ will come in power and great glory, and what a terrible thing it would be if we
          should not be ready! Let us get ready at once. Separate evil from you, begin to sing the song of praise and
          rejoicing here below.... Let your lips be tuned to praise God.... Angels</p>
      <p>in heaven are praising God all the time, and here are mortals for whom Christ left the heavenly home and
          suffered mockery, insult, and death, that He might lift us up to sit in heavenly places, and they offer no
          song of praise.</p>
      <p>If you sit in heavenly places with Christ, you cannot refrain from praising God. Begin to educate your tongues
          to praise Him and train your hearts to make melody to God; and when the evil one begins to settle his gloom
          about you, sing praise to God. When things go crossways at your homes, strike up a song about the matchless
          charms of the Son of God, and I tell you, when you touch this strain, Satan will leave you. You can drive out
          the enemy with his gloom; ... and you can see, oh, so much clearer, the love and compassion of your heavenly
          Father.</p>
      <p>Those who come into sacred relation with the God of heaven are not left to the natural weakness and infirmity
          of their natures.... The world</p>
      <p>loses all attraction for them, for they seek a better country, an eternal world, a life that is to continue
          through <nobr>never-ending</nobr> ages. This is the theme of their thought and conversation. The Word of God
          becomes exceedingly precious. They discern spiritual things. They rejoice in “that blessed hope, and the
          glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Titus.2.13"><span class="ft19">Titus 2:13</span></a>). They long to
          see the King in His beauty, the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[96]</span><span class="ft27">angels that have never fallen, and the land of unfading
          bloom.</span></p>
