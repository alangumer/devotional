      <p><strong>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but</strong></p>
      <p>rather reprove them. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.5.11"><span class="ft9">Ephesians
          5:11</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Many professed Christians are well represented by the vine that is trailing upon the ground and entwining its
          tendrils about the roots and rubbish that lie in its path. To all such the message comes, “Come out from among
          them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be
          a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.6.17"><span class="ft10">2 Corinthians 6:17,
          18</span></a>).</p>
      <p>There are conditions to meet if we would be blessed and honored by God. We are to separate from the world and
          refuse to touch those things that will separate our affections from God. God has the first and highest claims
          upon His people. Set your affections upon Him and upon heavenly things. Your tendrils must be severed from
          everything earthly. You are exhorted to touch not the unclean thing, for in touching this you will yourself
          become unclean. It is impossible for you to unite with those who are corrupt, and still remain pure. “What
          fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what
          concord hath Christ with Belial?” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.6.14"><span
          class="ft21">verses 14, 15</span></a>). God and Christ and the heavenly host would have man know that if he
          unites with the corrupt, he will become corrupt....</p>
      <p>All our actions are affected by our religious experience. If our experi- ence is founded in God; if we are
          daily tasting the power of the world to come, and have the fellowship of the Spirit; if each day we hold with
          a firmer grasp the higher life, principles that are holy and elevating will be inwrought in us, and it will be
          as natural for us to seek purity and holiness and separation from the world as it is for the angels of glory
          to execute the mission of love assigned them.</p>
      <p>Our consecration to God must be a living principle, interwoven with the life and leading to
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacrifice.</nobr> It must underlie all our thoughts and be the spring
          of every action. This will elevate us above</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[170]</span><span class="ft27">the world and separate us from its polluting
          influence.</span></p>
