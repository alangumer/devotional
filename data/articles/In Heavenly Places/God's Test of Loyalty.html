    <h1>God’s Test of Loyalty, May 23</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as</strong></p>
      <p>he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his</p>
      <p><span class="ft12">commandments.</span><a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Deuteronomy.26.18">Deuteronomy 26:18</a><span
          class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>God has a test for us, and if we come up to the standard we shall be a peculiar people. The Sabbath draws a
          separating line between us and the world, not faintly but in plain, distinct colors. To those who have
          received the light of this truth the Sabbath is a test; it is not a human requirement, but God’s test. It is
          what will distinguish between those who serve God and those who serve Him not, and upon this point will come
          the last great conflict between truth and error. All who profess to keep God’s law should stand united in the
          sacred observance of His holy Sabbath....</p>
      <p>When the destroying angel was about to pass through the land of Egypt and smite the <nobr>first-born</nobr> of
          both man and beast, the Israelites were directed to bring their children into the house with them and to
          strike the doorpost with blood; and none were to go out of the house, for all that were found among the
          Egyptians would be destroyed with them.</p>
      <p>We should take this lesson to ourselves. Again the destroying angel is to pass through the land. There is to be
          a mark placed upon God’s people, and that mark is the keeping of His holy Sabbath. We are not to follow our
          own will and judgment and flatter ourselves that God will come to our terms.... That which looks unimportant
          to you may be of the highest</p>
      <p>consequence in God’s special plans for the preservation of your life or the salvation of your soul. God tests
          our faith by giving us some part to act in connection with His interposition in our behalf. To those who
          comply with the conditions His promise will be fulfilled....</p>
      <p>We are faithfully to teach our children God’s commandments; we should bring them into subjection to parental
          authority; and then by faith and prayer to commit them to God, and He will work with our efforts, for He has
          promised it. And when the overflowing scourge shall pass through</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[151]</span><span class="ft27">the land, they, with us, may be hidden in the secret of the
          Lord’s pavilion.</span></p>
