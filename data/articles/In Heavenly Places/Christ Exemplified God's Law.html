      <p><strong>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of</strong></p>

      <p>In the councils of heaven it was determined that there must be given to mankind a living exemplification of the
          law. Having decided to make this great sacrifice, God left nothing obscure, nothing indefinite, in regard to
          the salvation of the human race. He gave to mankind a standard by which to form character. With an audible
          voice and in awful grandeur He spoke His law from Mount Sinai. Distinctly He stated what we must do in order
          to render acceptable obedience to Him and ... remain loyal to His law. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
          all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the
          second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law
          and the prophets” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.22.37"><span
          class="ft21">Matthew</span></a><nobr><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.22.37"><span
          class="ft21">22:37-40</span></a>).</nobr></p>
      <p>So deep was the Lord’s interest in the beings He had created, so great His love for the world, that He “gave
          his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.3.16"><span class="ft21">John 3:16</span></a>). Christ came to
          bring moral power to man, to elevate, ennoble, and strengthen him, enabling him to be a partaker of the divine
          nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. He proved to the inhabitants of the
          unfallen worlds and to human beings that the law can be kept. While possessing the nature of man, He obeyed
          the law of God, vindicating God’s justice in demanding that it be obeyed. In the judgment His life will be an
          unanswerable argument in favor of God’s law.</p>
      <p>All who possess the faculty of reason may learn the measure of their duty. Christ is our pattern. In humanity
          He lived a spotless life. He was merciful, compassionate, <nobr>obedient—full</nobr> of goodness and truth. By
          His life of obedience He gave a true representation of the law. By uniting with Christ, fallen, sinful human
          beings may conform the life to the divine precepts. By keeping the commandments of God, they become laborers
          together with Him who came to the world to represent the Father by</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[39]</span><span class="ft27">keeping all His commandments.</span></p>
