    <h1>Breaking the Power of Death, February 7</h1>

      <p><strong>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy
          plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hosea.13.14"><span
          class="ft6">Hosea 13:14</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Well might all heaven be astonished at the reception their loved Com- mander received in the world! ... He made
          the world, and yet the world knew Him not. Friends denied Him, forsook Him, and betrayed Him. He was assailed
          by temptation. Human agony convulsed His divine soul. He was lacerated with cruel scourgings. His hands were
          pierced with nails, His holy temples were crowned with thorns.... It was the working</p>
      <p>of Satan’s machinations that made the life of Christ one dark series of afflictions and sadness; and at last he
          compassed Christ’s death....</p>
      <p>In the act of dying, Christ was destroying him who had the power of death. He carried out the plan, finished
          the work which from Adam’s fall He had covenanted to undertake. By dying for the guilt of a sinful world, He
          reinstated fallen man, on condition of obedience to God’s commandments, in the position from which he had
          fallen in consequence of disobedience. And when He broke the fetters of the tomb and rose triumphant from the
          dead He answered the question, “If a man die, shall he live again?” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Job.14.14"><span class="ft17">Job 14:14</span></a>). Christ made it
          possible that every child of Adam might, through a life of obedience, overcome sin and rise also from the
          grave to his heritage of immortality purchased by the blood of Christ.</p>
      <p>Our salvation was wrought out by infinite suffering to the Son of God. His divine bosom received the anguish,
          the agony, the pain that the sinfulness of Adam brought upon the race. The heel of Christ was indeed bruised
          when His humanity suffered, and grief heavier than that which ever oppressed the beings He had created weighed
          down His soul as He was engaged in paying the vast debt which man owed to God.</p>
      <p>The question, “If a man die, shall he live again?” has been answered....</p>
      <p>God in human form has brought life and immortality to light through the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[45]</span><span class="ft27">gospel. In dying, Christ secured eternal life for all who
          believe in Him.</span></p>
