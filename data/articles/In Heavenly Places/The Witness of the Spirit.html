    <h1>The Witness of the Spirit, May 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the</strong></p>
      <p>children of God. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.8.16"><span class="ft9">Romans
          8:16</span></a>.</p>
      <p>You may have the witness of the Spirit that your ways please God. This is obtained by believing in the Word of
          God, by appropriating that Word to your own soul. This is eating the bread of life, and this will bring
          eternal life. Compare scripture with scripture. Study the representation of the life of a true Christian as
          delineated in the Word of God.</p>
      <p>The law of God is the great standard of righteousness. This the apostle declares is holy, just, and good. David
          says, “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.19.7"><span class="ft17">Psalm 19:7</span></a>). Christ says,
          “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” ... “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
          loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to
          him” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.14.15"><span class="ft17">John 14:15, 21</span></a>).
          This is most assuredly the witness of the Spirit.... “If ye keep</p>
      <p>my <nobr>commandments”—from</nobr> the <nobr>heart—“ye</nobr> shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my
          Father’s commandments, and abide in his love” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.15.10"><span
          class="ft10">John 15:10</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Those who are obedient to the will of God will not have a hard and miserable time in this life. Hear again the
          words of Christ: “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy
          might be full” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.15.11"><span class="ft21">verse
          11</span></a>). This is the witness which it is the privilege of all to <nobr>have—the</nobr> joy of Christ in
          the soul through appropriating the word of God ... and bringing the requirements of Christ into the practical
          life. There is full assurance of hope in believing every word of Christ, believing in Him, being united to Him
          by living faith. When this is his experience, the human being is no longer under the law, for the law no
          longer condemns his course of action....</p>
      <p>To them that believe, Christ is precious. His Spirit moving upon the mind and heart of the believer is in
          perfect agreement with that which is written in the Word. The Spirit and the Word agree perfectly. Thus
