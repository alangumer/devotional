      <p><strong>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things,</strong></p>
      <p>which is the head, even Christ. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.4.15"><span
          class="ft9">Ephesians 4:15</span></a>.</p>
      <p>I wish we could have a pledge in our hearts that we would not utter any one word against a brother or a sister.
          Remember that they also are tempted, it may be more strongly than you.... Those who are really the</p>
      <p>most erring are in greatest need of your help. Do not gossip about them and make remarks about their character,
          but go to them in the love of Jesus and the love of the truth and try to help them....</p>
      <p>When you are troubled with doubts, and darkness compasses your own soul, the very best course you can pursue to
          get out of this darkness is to help someone else who is discouraged. As you try to lift others up, behold, you
          lift up yourself into close connection with God. As you show kindness to others you will help yourself, for
          the same will be reflected back upon you. The man who has the most of Christ in the soul will manifest the
          tenderest sympathy for the souls who need help....</p>
      <p>You will always have erring ones among you, and here is where you can show a Christian character. Do not push
          them away from you, but if you have light seek to let it shine upon them, and in this way you can help them
          toward heaven. Every soul that has the spirit of Christ will work the works of Christ. And if any see one
          wandering away from Christ, he will feel as Christ did about the lost sheep. There were ninety and nine in the
          fold, but He went out after the one that had strayed away. This is the spirit we should manifest. As children
          of God we should walk in the light, and as we follow in the light we shall lighten the path for others. Let us
          cultivate gratitude to God and then we shall not get our eyes upon little difficulties. And although our
          brethren and sisters may err, shall we err? We have faults, as well as they, and we want compassion, as well
          as they; we should have compassion for one another.</p>
      <p>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and
          hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Colossians.3.16"><span class="ft30">Colossians 3:16</span></a>).
          Here is</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[290]</span><span class="ft27">the privilege of the Christian.</span></p>
