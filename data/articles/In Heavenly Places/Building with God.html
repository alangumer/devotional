    <h1>Building with God, June 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry,</strong></p>
      <p>ye are God’s building. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.3.9"><span class="ft9">1
          Corinthians 3:9</span></a>.</p>
      <p>This figure represents human character, which is to be wrought upon point by point. Each day God works on His
          building, stroke upon stroke, to perfect the structure, that it may become a holy temple for Him. Man is to
          cooperate with God, striving in His strength to make himself what God designs him to be, building his life
          with pure, noble deeds.</p>
      <p>Man works and God works. Man is called upon to strain every muscle and to exercise every faculty in the
          struggle for immortality, but it is God who supplies the efficiency. God has made amazing sacrifices for human
          beings. He has expended mighty energy to reclaim man from transgression and sin to loyalty and obedience, but
          He does nothing without the cooperation of humanity.... It is by unceasing endeavor that</p>
      <p>we maintain the victory over the temptations of Satan....</p>
      <p>No one is borne upward without stern, persevering effort in his own behalf. All must engage in the warfare for
          themselves. Individually we are responsible for the issue of the struggle; though Noah, Daniel, and Job were
          in the land, they could deliver neither son nor daughter by their righteousness....</p>
      <p>Often the training and education of a lifetime must be discarded, that one may become a learner in the school
          of Christ. Our hearts must be educated to become steadfast in God. We are to form habits of thought that will
          enable us to resist temptation. We must learn to look upward. The principles of the Word of
          <nobr>God—principles</nobr> that are as high as heaven and that compass <nobr>eternity—we</nobr> are to
          understand in their bearing on our daily life. Every act, every word, every thought, is to be in accord with
          these principles.</p>
      <p>The precious graces of the Holy Spirit are not developed in a moment. Courage, fortitude, meekness, faith,
          unwavering trust in God’s power to save, are acquired by the experience of years. By a life of holy
          endeavor</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[160]</span><span class="ft27">and firm adherence to the right the children of God are to
          seal their destiny.</span></p>
