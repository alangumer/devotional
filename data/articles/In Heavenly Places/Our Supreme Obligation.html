    <h1>Our Supreme Obligation, July 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have
          suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.5.10"><span class="ft6">1 Peter
          5:10</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>So perfect is the character represented which men must have in order to be Christâ€™s disciples that the infidel
          has said that it is not possible for any human being to attain unto it. But no less a standard must be
          presented by all who claim to be children of God. Infidels know not that celestial aid is provided for all who
          seek for it by faith. Every provision has been made in behalf of every soul who shall seek to be a partaker of
          the divine nature and be complete in Jesus Christ. Every defect is to be discerned and cut away from the
          character with an unsparing decision.</p>
      <p>The people of God are to turn every action into devotion. They are to partake of every meal as if they knew it
          was a token of the love of the infinite God expressed to them. The termination of one duty is to be the
          commencement of the next that presents itself. Then the Christian character will be manifest in a life of
          continuous obedience and service to Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Whatever business engagements men may yoke up with, if Christians, they must wear the yoke of duty to Christ.
          This is their allegiance. They are to consider themselves bound by superior obligations. The Master, Jesus
          Christ, has placed His yoke upon the neck of every disciple. The life service is pledged to Him in accepting
          His yoke. Anything that will mar or hinder his perfect service to God is to be broken off, whatever its nature
          or character may be....</p>
      <p>The Lord has united His nature with humanity expressly that He might become a more distinguishable and definite
          object for our contemplation and love. He invites us to draw near and contemplate the great light, the
          invisible God invested in robes of humanity, emitting a glory so softened and subdued that our eyes can endure
          the sight. Christ is the light of heaven. In His face we shall see God. Bear in mind the prayer of Christ,
          that His people may be one with Him as He is one with the Father, that</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[202]</span><span class="ft27">they may be with Him where He is and behold His
          glory.</span></p>
