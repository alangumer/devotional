    <h1>Prayer Moves Heaven, March 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it</strong></p>
      <p>shall be opened unto you. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.7.7"><span class="ft9">Matthew
          7:7</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Why is it that we do not receive more from Him who is the source of light and power? We expect too
          little....</p>
      <p>We do not value as we should the power and efficacy of prayer. “The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we
          know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings
          which cannot be uttered” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.8.26"><span class="ft17">Romans
          8:26</span></a>). God desires us to come to Him in prayer, that He may enlighten our minds. He alone can give
          clear conceptions of truth. He alone can soften and subdue the heart. He can quicken the understanding to
          discern truth from error. He can establish the wavering mind and give it a knowledge and a faith that will
          endure the test. Pray, then; pray without ceasing. The Lord who heard Daniel’s prayer will hear yours if you
          will approach Him as Daniel did.</p>
      <p>Let us live in close communion with God. The joy of the Chris- tian arises from a sense of God’s love and care
          for His children and the assurance that He will not leave them alone in their weakness.</p>
      <p>We need to know how to pray. It is not tame, spiritless prayers that take hold of the divine attributes. Prayer
          is heard by God when it comes from a heart broken by a sense of unworthiness. Prayer was instituted for our
          comfort and salvation, that through faith and hope we may lay hold on the rich promises of God. Prayer is the
          expression of the desires of a soul hungering and thirsting for righteousness.</p>
      <p>Prayer is a <nobr>heaven-ordained</nobr> means of success. Appeals, petitions, entreaties, between man and man,
          move men and act a part in controlling the affairs of nations. But prayer moves heaven. That power alone that
          comes in answer to prayer will make men wise in the wisdom of heaven and enable them to work in the unity of
          the Spirit, joined together by the bonds of peace. Prayer, faith, confidence in God, bring a divine power that
          sets human calculations at their real <nobr>worth—nothingness....</nobr> He who</p>
      <p>places himself where God can enlighten him, advances, as it were, from</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[76]</span><span class="ft27">the partial obscurity of dawn to the full radiance of
          noonday.</span></p>
