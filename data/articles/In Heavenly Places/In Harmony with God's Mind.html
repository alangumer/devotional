    <h1>In Harmony with God’s Mind, June 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your</strong></p>
      <p>hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.4.8"><span class="ft9">James</span></a></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.4.8">4:8</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>Angels of God are drawn toward all who in their thoughts and devoted service draw nigh to God.... It is a great
          misfortune to be <nobr>double-minded.</nobr></p>
      <p>“A double minded man is unstable in all his ways” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.1.8"><span class="ft9">James 1:8</span></a>).... Let us</p>
      <p>use to a purpose the mind the Lord has given us. Ambition, covetousness, the mania to follow the fashions, the
          customs, and practices of the world in order not to be thought singular, will soon obliterate all lines of
          distinction between the Christian’s lines of pursuit and the practices of the world.</p>
      <p>The love of pleasure is not to be cherished and indulged. When the human being, formed to do service for God,
          finds his time absorbed with plans that the Lord has nought to do with, he may well inquire, What end do I
          have in view? Whose service do I really enjoy? What does this eager strife for distinction amount to?</p>
      <p>As stewards over the Lord’s property, we are to keep the temple of the soul cleansed from all the rubbish and
          defilement of the world.... All our</p>
      <p>talents are to be used, every thought is to be enlisted, every power to be put forth to bring us into harmony
          with the mind of God. We are to adorn ourselves with all the graces of the Spirit, emulating all that is
          upright and pure and elevating and ennobling, copying the excellencies, and embodying the perfections of the
          heavenly family, obtaining an education that will fit us to unite with the royal family in the courts of
          heaven.</p>
      <p>We have the privilege of being trained under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. All the attributes that are
          excellent are to strengthen our moral powers, that they may have no mist or tarnish upon them. We are weaving
          our threads in the web of humanity; not a thread of <nobr>self-glory</nobr> must be woven into the fabric. All
          heaven is imparting its help that we may surmount every obstacle.... We are to build characters of a
          goodly</p>
      <p>fabric, spiritual, heavenly, perfect. God bids us work for time and for</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[166]</span><span class="ft27">eternity that we may grow after the divine
          likeness.</span></p>
