    <h1>Too Late! December 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>While it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your</strong></p>
      <p>hearts, as in the provocation. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.3.15"><span
          class="ft9">Hebrews 3:15</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Oh, who will describe to you the lamentations that will arise when at the boundary line which parts time and
          eternity the righteous Judge will lift up His voice and declare, “It is too late.” Long have the wide gates of
          heaven stood open and the heavenly messengers have invited and entreated “Whosoever will, let him take the
          water of life freely” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.22.17"><span
          class="ft10">Revelation 22:17</span></a>). “To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart.” But at
          length the mandate goes forth, “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be
          filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy
          still” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.22.11"><span class="ft10">Revelation
          22:11</span></a>).</p>
      <p>The heavenly gate closes, the invitation of salvation ceases. In heaven it is said, “It is done.” Such a time
          is not far distant. I plead with you to make sure work for eternity, to lay hold on the hope set before you in
          the gospel. Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for if you merely seek, you will not be able.</p>
      <p>The world is loaded down with the curse which sin brings. It is literally deluged with sin, with violence and
          corruption, as in the days of Noah. And yet at this fearful period of our world’s history many are asleep.
          They cease to make efforts to become Christians....</p>
      <p>Honesty, nobility, purity of soul, fellowship with God and angels, the heavenly hope, the eternal inheritance,
          the joys unspeakable and the bliss immeasurable, are your birthright, and will you barter away these treasures
          for sinful pleasure? ... What shall worldly pleasures avail you when all the world shall be overwhelmed as was
          Sodom and destroyed like Gomorrah? ...</p>
      <p>Too late will sinners realize that they have sold their birthright. The crown that they might have had shines
          upon the brow of another. The inheritance which they might have had is lost. Beware how you trifle with
          temptation. Beware how you boast of your strength. Christ is your everlasting strength; confide in God, lay
          hold of His strength, and He will</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[363]</span><span class="ft27">bring you off conqueror and you will wear the crown of
          victory.</span></p>
