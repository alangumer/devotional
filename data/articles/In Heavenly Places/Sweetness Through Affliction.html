    <h1>Sweetness Through Affliction, September 23</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble,
          by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.1.4"><span class="ft6">2 Corinthians
          1:4</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who have borne the greatest sorrows are frequently the ones who carry the greatest comfort to others,
          bringing sunshine wherever they go. Such ones have been chastened and sweetened by their afflictions; they did
          not lose confidence in God when trouble assailed them, but clung closer to His protecting love. Such ones are
          living proof of the tender care of God, who makes the darkness as well as the light and chastens us for our
          good. Christ is the light of the world; in Him is no darkness. Precious light! Let us live in that light! Bid
          adieu to sadness and repining. Rejoice in the Lord always.</p>
      <p>It is selfish to devote our precious time to mourning over disappointed hopes, indulging in useless grief that
          clouds the family circle. We should be cheerful, if only for the benefit of those who depend more or less upon
          us for happiness.... It is our duty to make the best of everything, and to</p>
      <p>cultivate a habit of looking at the bright side of things. Let the cloud that shadows us pass over, while we
          wait patiently till the clear blue sky again appears and the blessed sunshine is revealed.... Let us all
          forget self</p>
      <p>as much as possible, cultivate cheerfulness, seek to brighten the lives of others, and we shall then have less
          desire to complain of our own lot.</p>
      <p>The afflicted may take courage, the desponding may hope, for they have a sympathizing friend in Jesus. All our
          troubles and griefs we may pour into His sympathizing ears. When we associate together let it not be to talk
          darkness and unbelief, to recount the gloomy chapters in our life experience. Let us talk of the love of God
          that has been manifested to us, that is seen in nature, in the firmament of the heavens, in all the wise
          arrangements of Providence. Let us search out the rays of sunshine that have brightened our pathway, and
          linger over their memory with grateful hearts. Let us dwell upon the matchless love of Christ, for in Him we
          have a constant theme of rejoicing. In Him is no darkness. He is the Light</p>
