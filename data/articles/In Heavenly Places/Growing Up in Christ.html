      <p><strong>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying
          again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God. <a

      <p>At the entrance gate of the path that leads to everlasting life God places faith, and He lines the whole way
          with the light and peace and joy of willing obedience. The traveler in this way keeps ever before him the mark
          of his high calling in Christ. The prize is ever in sight. To him God’s commands are righteousness and joy and
          peace in the Holy Spirit. The things that first appeared to be crosses are found by experience to be
          crowns.</p>
      <p>“Learn of me,” is the Saviour’s command. Yes, learn of Him how to live the Christ <nobr>life—a</nobr> life pure

          more closely the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
      <p>The Christian is first a babe in Christ. Then he becomes a child. Constantly he is to make advancement
          proportionate to the opportunities and privileges granted him. Ever he is to remember that he is not his own,
          that he has been bought with a price, and that he must make the best possible use of the talents entrusted to
          him. Even in the infancy of his spiritual understanding, the Christian is to do his best, making steady
          advancement toward the higher, holier life. He is to realize that he is a laborer together with God....</p>
      <p>He is never to become <nobr>self-sufficient,</nobr> but is to count all things but loss for the excellency of
          the knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord. He is to walk and work in the Saviour’s companionship. As he does
          this, his faith will increase. Constantly beholding Christ, he will be changed into the</p>
