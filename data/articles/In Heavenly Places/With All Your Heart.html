      <p><strong>And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with</strong></p>
      <p>all your heart. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Jeremiah.29.13"><span class="ft9">Jeremiah
          29:13</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Many have not had that religious experience that is essential for them, that they may stand without fault
          before the throne of God. The furnace fires of affliction He permits to be kindled upon them to consume the
          dross, to refine, to purify and cleanse them from the defilement of sin, of self love, and to bring them to
          know God and to become acquainted with Jesus Christ by walking with Him as did Enoch....</p>
      <p>That which is called praying morning and evening, according to cus- tom, is not always fervent and effectual.
          It is with many a sleepy, dull, and heartless repetition of words, and does not reach the ear of the Lord. God
          does not need or require your ceremonial compliments, but He will respect the broken heart, the confession of
          sins, the contrition of the soul. The cry of the humble, broken heart He will not despise....</p>
      <p>We must have such love for Jesus that we will consider it a privilege to suffer and even die for His sake. We
          may tell the Lord all our trials, tell Him all our weaknesses, tell Him all our dependence upon His might and
          His power. This is true prayer. If ever there was a time when the Spirit of grace and supplication was needed
          to be poured out upon us, God Himself inditing our prayers, it is now. And the promise is to be brought before
          every church, and the simplicity of truth dwelt upon. “Ask, and ye shall receive” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.16.24"><span class="ft21">John 16:24</span></a>). It is faith,
          living faith that we need....</p>
      <p>The Lord will lead His people and guide them. The commandment will go forth from God as to Daniel, to help
          those making earnest intercession to the throne of His grace in their time of need.</p>
      <p>We need to open the heart to Christ. We need much firmer faith and more fervent devotion. We need to die to
          self, and in mind and heart to cherish an adoring love for our Saviour. When we will seek the Lord with all
          the heart we shall find Him, and our hearts will be all aglow with His love. Self will sink into
          insignificance, and Jesus will be all and in all to</p>
