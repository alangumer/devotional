      <p>Do not take your troubles to human beings. Take them to the Lord. You may think that others ought to sympathize
          with you in your trials, but you will sometimes be disappointed. Jesus never disappoints the one who comes to
          Him for help. He is saying to you today, “Come unto me, ...</p>
      <p>and I will give you rest” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.11.28"><span
          class="ft10">Matthew 11:28</span></a>). He will give you rest in Him. No one who comes to Him goes away
          unhelped. Take your burdens to the divine Burden Bearer and leave them with Him, knowing that He will carry
          them for you....</p>
      <p>Act your part in helping yourselves, as all must do who would be blessed. Do not dwell upon the hardships of
          the Christian life. Do not talk of your trials.... Do not utter one despondent word, for such words</p>
      <p>please Satan. Talk of Christ’s goodness and tell of His power. Words of hope and trust and courage are as
          easily spoken as words of complaint....</p>
      <p>When the enemy tells you that the Lord has forsaken you, tell him that you know He has not; for He declares, “I
          will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.13.5"><span
          class="ft10">Hebrews 13:5</span></a>). Dismiss the enemy. Tell him you will not dishonor the Lord by doubting
          His love....</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the help that the Saviour is willing to bestow on us. He asks us to bring into our lives
          the grace that will keep us from sin. From the cross of Calvary there comes to us liberty, hope, and strength.
          Do not dishonor your Redeemer by doubting His power. Trust Him all the time. Take hold of the riches of His
          grace, saying, “I will believe; I do believe that Jesus died for me.” The way before you may seem dark, but
          Jesus can make it light.</p>
      <p>Be joyful in God. Christ is light and in Him is no darkness at all. Look toward the light. Accustom yourselves
          to speak the praise of God. Make others happy. This is your first work. It will strengthen the best traits of
          character. Throw the windows of the soul wide open heavenward and let the sunshine of Christ’s righteousness
          in. Morning, noon, and night your</p>
