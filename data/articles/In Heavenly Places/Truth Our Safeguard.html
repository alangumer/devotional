    <h1>Truth Our Safeguard, December 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise
          false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible,
          they shall deceive the very elect. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.24.23"><span
          class="ft30">Matthew 24:23, 24</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>In the wilderness of temptation Satan came to Christ as an angel from the courts of God. It was by his words,
          not by his appearance, that the Saviour recognized the enemy.</p>
      <p>The time is coming when Satan will work miracles right in your sight, claiming that he is Christ; and if your
          feet are not firmly established upon the truth of God, then you will be led away from your foundation. The
          only safety for you is to search for the truth as for hid treasures. Dig for the truth as you would for
          treasures in the earth, and present the Word of God, the Bible, before your heavenly Father, and say,
          Enlighten me; teach me what is truth. And when His Holy Spirit shall come into your hearts, to impress the
          truth into your souls, you will not let it go easily. You have gained such an experience in searching the
          Scriptures that every point is established.</p>
      <p>Without the enlightenment of the Spirit of God we shall not be able to discern truth from error and shall fall
          under the masterful temptations and deceptions that Satan will bring upon the world. We are near the close of
          the controversy between the Prince of light and the prince of darkness, and soon the delusions of the enemy
          will try our faith, of what sort it is.</p>
      <p>If ever there was a time when we needed faith and spiritual enlighten- ment, it is now. Those who are watching
          unto prayer and are searching the Scriptures daily with an earnest desire to know and do the will of God, will
          not be led astray by any of the deceptions of Satan.... We want the</p>
      <p>truth on every point. We want it unadulterated with error and unpolluted by the maxims, customs, and opinions
          of the world. We want the truth with all its inconvenience. The acceptance of truth ever involves a cross. But
          Jesus gave His life as a sacrifice for us, and shall we not give Him our</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[351]</span><span class="ft27">best affections, our holiest aspirations, our fullest
          service?</span></p>
