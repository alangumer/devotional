      <p><strong>For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee;
          behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. <a

      <p>Now, just now, is our time of probation, wherein we are to prepare for heaven. Christ gave His life that we
          might have this probation. But so long as time shall last, Satan will strive for the mastery over us. He works
          with power to lead men to become absorbed in money getting. He invents many kinds of amusement, so that their
          minds may be engrossed with worldly pleasure. He would have them forget all about the inward
          <nobr>adorning—the</nobr> adorning of a meek and quiet <nobr>spirit—which</nobr> in the sight of God is of
          great price. He is determined that every moment shall be filled with efforts to carry out ambitious projects
          or to amuse and gratify self....</p>
      <p>Satan uses his influence to drown the voice of God and the voice of conscience, and the world acts as if under
          his control. Men have chosen him as their leader.... Infatuated with schemes for pleasure and</p>
      <p>amusement, they are striving for that which will perish with the using....</p>
      <p>The <nobr>fast-fulfilling</nobr> signs of the times declare that the great day of the Lord is right upon us. In
          that day shall it be said of any of us: “This man was called by God, but he would not hear, he would not give
          heed. Again and again the Spirit moved upon his heart, but he said, ‘Go thy way for this time; when I have a
          convenient season, I will call for thee.’ This man saw the Saviour’s sacrifice in a beautiful light, but some
          matter of minor importance came in, and his heart was captivated.... Every gracious,</p>
      <p>heavenly influence was dismissed.”</p>
      <p>Christ is ready to set us free from sin, but He does not force the will, and if by persistent transgression the
          will itself is wholly bent on evil, and we do not desire to be set free, if we will not accept His grace, what
          more can He do? We have destroyed ourselves by our determined rejection of His love. “Behold, now is the
          accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” “Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts”
