    <h1>As Steadfast As Daniel, September 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a
          flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.50.7"><span
          class="ft6">Isaiah 50:7</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The youth have an example in Daniel, and if they are true to principle and to duty they will be instructed as
          Daniel was. As the wisdom of the world viewed the matter, he and his three companions had every advantage
          secured to them. But here their first test was to come. Their principles must come into collision with the
          regulations and appointments of the king. They were to eat the food placed upon his table and drink his
          wine....</p>
      <p>Daniel “purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with
          the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself”
          (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Daniel.1.8"><span class="ft10">Daniel 1:8</span></a>).</p>
      <p>This request was not preferred in a defiant spirit, but was solicited as a great favor.... Daniel and his
          companions ... were courteous, kind, respect-</p>
      <p>ful, possessing the grace of meekness and modesty. And now as Daniel and his fellows were brought to the test,
          they placed themselves fully on the side of righteousness and truth. They did not move capriciously, but
          intelligently. They decided that as flesh meat had not composed their diet in the past, neither should it come
          into their diet in the future. And as the use of wine had been prohibited to all those who should engage in
          the service of God, they determined that they would not partake of it....</p>
      <p>Daniel and his companions knew not what would be the result of their decision. They knew not but that it would
          cost them their lives, but they determined to keep the straight path of strict temperance, even in the courts
          of licentious Babylon.... The good behavior of these youth obtained</p>
      <p>for them favor. They rested their case in the hands of God, following a discipline of <nobr>self-denial</nobr>
          and temperance in all things. And the Lord cooperated with Daniel and his fellows....</p>
      <p>These particulars were placed on record in the history of the children of Israel as a warning to all youth to
          avoid all approach to customs and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[262]</span><span class="ft27">practices and indulgences that would dishonor God in any
          way.</span></p>
