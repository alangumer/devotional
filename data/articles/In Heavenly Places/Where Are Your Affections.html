    <h1>Where Are Your Affections? October 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right
          hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Colossians.3.1"><span class="ft6">Colossians 3:1,
          2</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>We may have high anticipations in regard to the things of this life, but we shall meet with disappointment. We
          shall find that they fade away. But here is “an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not
          away, reserved in heaven for you” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.1.4"><span
          class="ft10">1 Peter 1:4</span></a>). We want our thoughts to be fixed on the things that will abide, not upon
          those that pass away with the using....</p>
      <p>When Christ came into this world He saw that men had left the future, eternal life out of their reckoning. He
          came to present that life before us, that by beholding it we might be led to change our relation to the things
          of this life, that our affections might be placed upon the things above, and not upon the things of the earth,
          so soon to pass away. The shadow that Satan has caused to intervene between our souls and God Christ seeks to
          roll back, that the view of God and eternity may become clear. While He does not despise this world, He places
          it in its proper position of subordination. And then He places the things of eternity in their relative
          importance before us, that we may fix the eye of faith upon the unseen. The things of temporal interest have
          power to engross the thoughts and affections, and it is important that we should be constantly educating and
          training our minds to dwell upon things of eternal interest. Will this make us unhappy? Will it cause us to
          have a hard time here? No, indeed.... The more of the Spirit of God, the more of His grace, is</p>
      <p>brought into our daily experience, the less friction there will be, the more happiness we shall have, and the
          more we shall impart to others.</p>
      <p>God does not design that eternity shall overwhelm us and unfit us for the duties of this life, and it will
          never do this if we accustom our minds to dwell upon the themes of eternity and mingle them with our life
          duties. The contemplation of eternal realities will not disqualify us for the duties of this life. All the
          useful pursuits and activities of life are to stand</p>
