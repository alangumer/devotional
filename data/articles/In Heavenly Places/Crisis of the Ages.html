    <h1>Crisis of the Ages, December 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy</strong></p>
      <p>mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of</p>
      <p>the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Joel.2.1"><span
          class="ft9">Joel 2:1</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Troublous times are right upon us. The fulfilling of the signs of the times gives evidence that the day of the
          Lord is near at hand. The daily papers are full of indications of a terrible conflict in the future. Bold
          robberies are of frequent occurrence. Strikes are common. Thefts and murders are committed on every hand. Men
          possessed of demons are taking the lives of men and women and little children. All these things testify that
          the coming of Christ is near at hand....</p>
      <p>In accidents and calamities by land and by sea, in great conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific
          hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand
          forms, Satan is exercising his power....</p>
      <p>The crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the heavens, passing over its usual round, and the
          heavens still declare the glory of God. Men are still eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying and
          giving in marriage. Merchants are still buying and selling.... Pleasure</p>
      <p>lovers are still crowding to theaters, horse races, gambling hells. The highest excitement prevails, yet
          probation’s hour is fast closing, and every case is about to be eternally decided. Satan sees that his time is
          short. He has set all his agents to work, that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied, and entranced, until
          the day of probation shall be ended and the door of mercy be forever shut. The time is right upon us when
          there will be sorrow that no human balm can heal. Sentinel angels are now restraining the four winds, that
          they shall not blow till the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads; but when God shall bid His angels
          loose the winds, there will be a scene of strife such as no pen can picture....</p>
      <p>“Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence.... He shall call to</p>
      <p>the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me;
          those that have made a covenant with</p>
