    <h1>Special Care for the Weak, April 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels
          do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.18.10"><span class="ft6">Matthew
          18:10</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Man is God’s property, and angels are looking with intense interest to see how man will deal with his fellow
          man. When heavenly intelligences see those who claim to be the sons and daughters of God putting forth
          Christlike efforts to help the erring, manifesting a tender, sympathetic spirit for the repentant and the
          fallen, angels press close to them and bring to their remembrance the very words that will soothe and uplift
          the soul. Holy angels are on the track of every one of us. We are not to despise the least of God’s little
          ones....</p>
      <p>Jesus has given His precious life, His personal attention, to the least of God’s little ones; and angels that
          excel in strength encamp round about them that fear God. Then let us be upon our guard, and never permit one
          contemptuous thought to occupy the mind in regard to one of the little ones of God. We should look after the
          erring with solicitude, and speak encouraging words to the fallen, and fear lest by some unwise action we
          shall turn them away from the pitying Saviour....</p>
      <p>All heaven is interested in the work of saving the lost. Angels watch with intense interest to see who will
          leave the ninety and nine and go out in tempest and storm and rain into the wild desert to seek the lost
          sheep. The lost are all around us, perishing and sadly neglected. But they are of value to God, the purchase
          of the blood of Christ.</p>
      <p>By all that has given us advantage over <nobr>another—be</nobr> it education and refinement, nobility of
          character, Christian training, religious experi- <nobr>ence—we</nobr> are in debt to those less favored; and,
          so far as lies in our power, we are to minister unto them. If we are strong, we are to stay up the hands of
          the weak. Angels of glory, that do always behold the face of the Father in heaven, make such their special
          charge. Angels are ever present where they are most needed, with those who have the hardest battle with self
          to fight and whose surroundings are the most disagreeable. And in this</p>
