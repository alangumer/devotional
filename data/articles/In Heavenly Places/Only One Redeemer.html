      <p><strong>God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet</strong></p>
      <p>sinners, Christ died for us. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.5.8"><span class="ft9">Romans
          5:8</span></a>.</p>
      <p>As soon as there was sin, there was a Saviour. Christ knew that He would have to suffer, yet He became man’s
          substitute. As soon as Adam sinned, the Son of God presented Himself as surety for the human race.</p>
      <p>Think of how much it cost Christ to leave the heavenly courts, and take His position at the head of humanity.
          Why did He do this? Because He was the only one who could redeem the fallen race. There was not a human being
          in the world who was without sin. The Son of God stepped down from His heavenly throne, laid off His royal
          robe and kingly crown, and clothed His divinity with humanity. He came to die for us, to lie in the tomb as
          human beings must, and to be raised for our justification. He came to become acquainted with all the
          temptations wherewith man is beset. He rose from the grave and proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph,
          “I am the resurrection, and the life.” One equal with God passed through death in our behalf. He tasted death
          for every man, that through Him every man might be a partaker of eternal life.</p>
      <p>Christ ascended to heaven, bearing a sanctified, holy humanity. He took this humanity with Him into the
          heavenly courts, and through the eternal ages He will bear it as the One who has redeemed every human being in
          the city of God, the One who has pleaded before the Father, “I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.”
          The palms of His hands bear the marks of the wounds that He received. If we are wounded and bruised, if we
          meet with difficulties that are hard to manage, let us remember how much Christ suffered for us....</p>
      <p>Our Saviour bore all that we are called upon to bear, so that no human being could say, “He does not know my
          suffering and my trials.” In all our afflictions He was afflicted....</p>
      <p>Satan declared that human beings could not live without sin. Christ passed over the ground where Adam stumbled
          and fell, and by a sinless life placed the human race on vantage ground, that every one might stand</p>
