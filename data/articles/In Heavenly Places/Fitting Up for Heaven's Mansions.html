      <p><strong>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;

          5:27</span></a></strong></p>
      <p>Christ is soon coming in the clouds of heaven, and we must be pre- pared to meet Him, not having spot or
          wrinkle or any such thing.... The</p>
      <p>converting power of God must be upon our hearts. We must study the life of Christ, and imitate the divine
          Pattern. We must dwell upon the perfection of His character, and be changed into His image. No one will enter
          the kingdom of God unless his will is brought into captivity to the will of Christ.</p>
      <p>Professed Christians keep altogether too near the lowlands of earth. Their eyes are trained to see only
          commonplace things, and their minds dwell upon the things their eyes behold. Their religious experience is
          often shallow and unsatisfying, and their words are light and valueless. How can such reflect the image of
          Christ? How can they send forth the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness? ...</p>
      <p>Heaven is free from all sin, from all defilement and impurity; and if we would live in its atmosphere, if we
          would behold the glory of Christ, we must be pure in heart, perfect in character through His grace and
          righteousness. We must not be taken up with pleasure and amusement, but be fitting up for the glorious
          mansions Christ has gone to prepare for us....</p>
      <p>Christ is soon coming in glory; and when His majesty is revealed, the world will wish that they had His favor.
          At that time we shall all desire a place in the mansions of heaven; but those who do not confess Christ now in
          word, in life, in character, cannot expect that He will confess them then before His Father and the holy
          angels....</p>
      <p>Oh, how happy will those be who have made themselves ready for the marriage supper of the Lamb, who are robed
          in the righteousness of Christ, and reflect His lovely image! They will have on the pure white linen which is
          the righteousness of the saints, and Christ will lead them by the side of living waters; God will wipe away
          all tears from their eyes,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[286]</span><span class="ft27">and they will have the life that runs parallel with the life
          of God.</span></p>
