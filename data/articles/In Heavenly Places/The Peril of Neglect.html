    <h1>The Peril of Neglect, January 31</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the
          Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him? <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.2.3"><span class="ft6">Hebrews 2:3</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>No greater gift can be bestowed upon man than that which is com- prehended in Christ.... A neglect to lay hold
          of the priceless treasure of</p>
      <p>salvation means the eternal ruin of your soul. The peril of indifference to God and neglect of His gift is
          measured by the greatness of salvation. God has done to the uttermost of His almighty power. The resources of
          infinite love have been exhausted in devising and executing the plan of redemption for man. God has revealed
          His character in the goodness, the mercy, compassion, and love manifested to save a race of guilty rebels.
          What could be done that has not been done in the provisions of the plan of salvation? If the sinner remains
          indifferent to the manifestation of the goodness of God, if he neglects so great a salvation, ... what can be
          done to touch his hard heart?</p>
      <p>What importance, what magnitude, it gives to the theme of redemption, that He who has undertaken the salvation
          of man was the brightness of the Father’s glory, the express image of His person! How, then, can Heaven regard
          those who neglect so great a salvation, wrought out for man at such infinite cost? To neglect to lay hold on
          the rich blessings of Heaven is to refuse, to set at nought, Him who was equal with the Father, the only One
          who could save fallen man. Oh, shall we through neglect of Christ throw away our one chance for eternal life?
          ...</p>
      <p>What love, what wonderful love, was displayed by the Son of God! The death we deserved was suffered to come
          upon Him that immortality might be given to us, who could never merit such a reward. Is not salva- tion great
          in its simplicity and wonderful in its comprehensiveness? ...</p>
      <p>Contemplating the fullness of the provision that God has made whereby every son and daughter of Adam may be
          saved, we are led to exclaim with John, “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
          should be called the sons of God” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.3.1"><span
          class="ft21">1 John 3:1</span></a>).... The plan of</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[38]</span><span class="ft27">redemption provides for every emergency and for every want of
          the soul.</span></p>
