      <p><strong>I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
          fruit; for without me ye can do nothing. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.15.5"><span
          class="ft6">John 15:5</span></a></strong></p>
      <p>Christ’s connection with His believing people is illustrated by this parable as by no other.</p>
      <p>All who receive Christ by faith become one with Him. The branches are not tied to the vine; they are not joined
          to it by any mechanical process of artificial fastening. They are united to the vine, so as to become part of
          it. They are nourished by the roots of the vine. So those who receive Christ by faith become one with Him in
          principle and action. They are united to Him, and the life they live is the life of the Son of God. They
          derive their life from Him who is life.</p>
      <p>Baptism may be repeated over and over again, but of itself it has no power to change the human heart. The heart
          must be united with Christ’s heart, the will must be submerged in His will, the mind must become one with His
          mind, the thoughts must be brought into captivity to Him.... The</p>
      <p>regenerated man has a vital connection with Christ. As the branch derives its sustenance from the parent stock
          and, because of this, bears much fruit, so the true believer, united with Christ, reveals in his life the
          fruits of the Spirit. The branch becomes one with the vine; storm cannot carry it away; frost cannot destroy
          its vital properties. Nothing is able to separate it from the vine. It is a living branch, and it bears the
          fruit of the vine. So with the believer. By good words and good actions he reveals the character of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>Christ has provided means whereby our whole life may be an unbroken communion with Himself; but the sense of
          Christ’s abiding presence can come only through living faith....</p>
      <p>Let all contemplate the completeness it is their privilege to have and ask themselves the question, Is my will
          submerged in Christ’s will? Is the fullness and richness of the Living <nobr>Vine—His</nobr> goodness, His
          mercy, His</p>
