    <h1>The Power of Truthfulness, June 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is</strong></p>
      <p>but for a moment. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.12.19"><span class="ft9">Proverbs
          12:19</span></a>.</p>
      <p>There are those who have so closely identified themselves with the truth that nothing, not even martyrdom and
          death, could sever them from it. Those who would evade the truth by silence, fearing to offend someone else,
          testify to a lie. Playing fast and loose with truth and dissembling to suit the opinions of someone else,
          means the shipwreck of faith. Let us despise falsifying. Let us never by a word or act or by silence testify
          to a lie....</p>
      <p>All who make untruthful statements ... are serving him who has been a liar from the beginning. Let us be on our
          guard against untruthfulness, which grows upon him who practices it. I say to all, make truth your girdle. Be
          true to your faith. Put away all prevarication and exaggeration. Never make a false statement. For the sake of
          your own soul and the souls of others, be true in your utterances. Never speak or act a falsehood. The truth
          alone will bear to be repeated. A firm adherence to truth is essential to the formation of Christian
          character. “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of
          righteousness” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.6.14"><span class="ft21">Ephesians
          6:14</span></a>).</p>
      <p>He who utters untruths sells his soul in a cheap market. His falsehoods may seem to serve in emergencies. He
          may make business advancement because he gains by falsehood what he could not gain by fair dealing. But he
          finally reaches the place where he can trust no one. Himself a falsifier, he has no confidence in the word of
          others.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely no safeguard against evil but truth. No man can stand firm for right in whose heart the
          truth does not abide. There is only one power that can make and keep us <nobr>steadfast—the</nobr> power of
          God, imparted to us through the grace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Connected with Christ, human nature becomes true and pure. Christ supplies the efficiency, and man becomes a
          power for good.... Truthfulness</p>
      <p>and integrity are attributes of God, and he who possesses these qualities</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[180]</span><span class="ft27">possesses a power that is invincible.</span></p>
