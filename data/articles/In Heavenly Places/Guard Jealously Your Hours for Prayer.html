      <p><strong>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after</strong></p>
      <p>thee, O God. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.42.1"><span class="ft9">Psalm
          42:1</span></a>.</p>
      <p>He who is a citizen of the heavenly kingdom will be constantly looking at things not seen. The power of earth
          over the mind and character is broken. He has the abiding presence of the heavenly Guest, in accordance with
          the promise, “I will love him, and will manifest myself to him” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.14.21"><span class="ft40">John 14:21</span></a>). He walks with
          God as did Enoch, in constant communion....</p>
      <p>Daily beset by temptation, constantly opposed by the leaders of the people, Christ knew that He must strengthen
          His humanity by prayer. In order to be a blessing to men He must commune with God, pleading for energy,
          perseverance, and steadfastness. Thus He showed His disciples where His strength lay. Without this daily
          communion with God no human being can gain power for service. It is the privilege of every one to commit
          himself, with all his trials and temptations, his sorrows and disappointments, to the loving heavenly Father.
          No one who does this, who makes God his confidant, will fall a prey to the enemy.</p>
      <p>“We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points
          tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
          obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.4.15"><span class="ft10">Hebrews 4:15,
          16</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>Guard jealously your hours for prayer and <nobr>self-examination.</nobr> Set apart some portion of each day for
          a study of the Scriptures and communion with God. Thus you will obtain spiritual strength and grow in grace
          and favor with God. He alone can direct our thoughts aright. He alone can give us noble aspirations and
          fashion our characters after the divine similitude. If we draw near to Him in earnest prayer, He will fill our
          hearts with high and holy purposes and with deep, earnest longing for purity and cleanness of thought....</p>
      <p>He imparts the richest blessings to those who serve Him with a pure heart. He teaches each one who opens the
          heart to His instruction and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[86]</span><span class="ft27">obeys His voice.</span></p>
