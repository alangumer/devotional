    <h1>Before the Heavenly Universe, November 10</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to</strong></p>
      <p><span class="ft12">men.</span><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.4.9">1 Corinthians
          4:9</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>God desires His children to show the world what it means to sit together in heavenly places in Christ, “that in
          the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ
          Jesus” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.3.7"><span class="ft10">Ephesians
          3:7</span></a>). This kindness He expects us to bring into our dealings with one another....</p>
      <p>The Lord desires His children to esteem one another as the purchase of the blood of Christ. When they do this
          they will know what it means to sit together in heavenly places in Christ. Our lips need to be sanctified with
          a live coal from the altar of God. Then we shall speak words that are elevating, refining, ennobling, words
          that are filled with the fragrance of Christ’s righteousness, words that are a savor of life unto life.</p>
      <p>Christ wants His followers to be like Him, because He desires to be correctly represented in the family circle,
          in the church, and in the world. He wants us to attend to ourselves. When we do this we shall find that we
          have enough to keep us busy. We are to accept Christ as our efficiency, our strength, that we may reveal His
          character to the world. This is the work resting upon us as Christians. We are to witness to the power of
          heavenly grace.</p>
      <p>But are there not many who are ... like a chestnut bur, hurting those with whom they come in contact? ... Those
          who represent Christ will not speak harshly. Their words will be pleasant and helpful. “Speaking the truth in
          love,” we “grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ ...” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.4.15"><span class="ft10">Ephesians 4:15</span></a>).</p>
      <p>God wants His sons and daughters to reveal before the synagogue of Satan, before the heavenly universe, before
          the world, the power of His grace, that men and angels may know that Christ has not died in vain. Let us show
          the world that we have power from on high.... May God help His</p>
      <p>people to get out of the rut into which they have fallen, and come to the place where they can walk and talk
          with God. Then, as they reflect the</p>
      <p>light and joy of heaven, God Himself will rejoice over them with singing. <span class="ft45">[322]</span></p>
