    <h1>Glories of the Future World, December 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor</strong></p>
      <p>perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth
          for him. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.64.4"><span class="ft41">Isaiah
          64:4</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Many have longed to penetrate into the glories of the future world and to have the secrets of eternal mysteries
          disclosed to them, but they knock in vain. That which is revealed is for us and for our children.... The
          Great</p>
      <p>Revealer hath opened to our intelligence many things that are essential in order that we may understand the
          heavenly attractions and have respect to the recompense of the reward....</p>
      <p>The unfoldings of Jesus in reference to heavenly things are of a char- acter that only the spiritual mind can
          appreciate. The imagination may summon its utmost powers in order to picture the glories of heaven, but “eye
          hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared
          for them that love him” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.2.9"><span class="ft21">1
          Corinthians 2:9</span></a>). The heavenly intelligences are all around us.... Angels</p>
      <p>of light create a heavenly atmosphere about the soul, lifting us toward the unseen and eternal. We cannot
          behold their forms with our natural sight; only by the spiritual vision can we discern heavenly things. Our
          human powers would be extinguished by the inexpressible glory of the angels of light. The spiritual ear alone
          can distinguish the harmony of heavenly voices. It is not Christ’s plan to excite the emotions by brilliant
          descriptions.... He has with sufficient distinctness presented Himself, the</p>
      <p>way, the truth, and the life, as the only means whereby salvation is to be obtained. No more than this is
          really required.</p>
      <p>He might bring the human soul to the threshold of heaven, and through the open door show us its inner glory
          flooding the heavenly sanctuary and shining out through its portals; but we must behold it by faith, not with
          the natural eyes. He does not forget that we are His human agents, to work the works of God in a world all
          seared and marred with the curse. It is in this world, that is clothed with moral darkness like the pall of
          death, where darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, that we</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[367]</span><span class="ft27">are to walk in the light of heaven.</span></p>
