      <p><strong>In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would</strong></p>
      <p>have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
          receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.14.2"><span class="ft41">John 14:2, 3</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The invitation is, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate,</p>
      <p>... and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the
          Lord Almighty” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.6.17"><span class="ft10">2
          Corinthians 6:17, 18</span></a>). Oh, what an exaltation is <nobr>this—to</nobr> be members of the royal
          family, children of the heavenly King! To have the Saviour of the universe, the King over all kings, know us
          by name, and to be heirs of God to the immortal inheritance, the eternal substance! This is our privilege;
          will we have the prize? Will we fight the battles of the Lord? Will we press the battle to the gate? Will we
          be victorious? I have decided that I must have heaven, and I want you to have it....</p>
      <p>Search the Bible, for it tells you of Jesus. I want you to read the Bible and see the matchless charms of
          Jesus. I want you to fall in love with the Man of Calvary, so that at every step you can say to the world, His
          “ways are ways of pleasantness, and all” His “paths are peace” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.3.17"><span class="ft10">Proverbs 3:17</span></a>). You
          want to represent Christ to the world. You want to show to the world you have a hope big with immortality. You
          want to drink of the waters of salvation. You want the heavenly angels to be in your dwelling. You want Christ
          to abide there....</p>
      <p>Praise the Lord, oh, my soul! He says He has gone to prepare mansions for me: “Let not your heart be troubled:
          ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
          told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
          receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.14.1"><span class="ft21">John</span></a><nobr><a

      <p>Thank God! It is these mansions that I am looking to. It is not the earthly mansions here, for they are to be
          shaken down by the mighty earthquake erelong; but it is those heavenly mansions that Christ has gone to
          prepare for the faithful. We have no home here. We are only pilgrims and strangers here, passing to a better
          country, even an heavenly.... May</p>
