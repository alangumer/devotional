    <h1>Take God’s Word on Trust, April 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy
          sins, Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.43.25"><span class="ft6">Isaiah 43:25,
          26</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan will come to you saying, You are a sinner. But do not let him fill your mind with the thought that,
          because you are sinful, God has cast you off. Say to him, Yes; I am a sinner, and for that reason I need a
          Saviour. I need forgiveness and pardon, and Christ says that if I come to Him I shall not perish. In His
          letter to me I read, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse
          us from all unrighteousness” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.1.9"><span class="ft17">1
          John 1:9</span></a>). I will believe the word He has left for me....</p>
      <p>The moment you grasp God’s promises by faith and say, I am the lost sheep that Jesus came to save, a new life
          will take possession of you, and you will receive strength to resist the tempter. But faith to grasp the
          promises does not come by feeling. “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.10.17"><span class="ft10">Romans 10:17</span></a>). You must
          not look for some great change to take place; you must not expect to feel some wonderful emotion....</p>
      <p>Take God’s word on trust, saying, He loves me: He gave His life for me; and He will save me.... Look away from
          yourself to Jesus. Embrace</p>
      <p>Him as your Saviour. Cease to bemoan your helpless condition. Looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of your
          faith, you will be inspired with hope and will see the salvation of God. When you feel tempted to mourn, force
          your lips to utter the praises of God. “Rejoice in the Lord alway” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Philippians.4.4"><span class="ft21">Philippians 4:4</span></a>). Is
          He not worthy of praise? Then educate your lips to talk of His glory and to magnify His name....</p>
      <p>Today the Lord says to you, Be not discouraged, but cast your burdens upon Me. You cannot carry your own sins.
          I will take them all.... If you</p>
      <p>will trust in Me, you will not want any good thing....</p>
      <p>Never has a soul that trusts in Jesus been left to perish. “I, even I, am he,” the Lord declares, “that
          blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[117]</span><span class="ft27">sake, and will not remember thy sins.”</span></p>
