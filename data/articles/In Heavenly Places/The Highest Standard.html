    <h1>The Highest Standard, May 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of</strong></p>
      <p>the law shall be justified. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.2.13"><span class="ft9">Romans
          2:13</span></a>.</p>
      <p>In the lives of many whose names are on the church books there has been no genuine change. The truth has been
          kept in the outer court. There has been no genuine conversion, no positive work of grace done in the
          heart....</p>
      <p>He who would build up a strong, symmetrical character must give all and do all for Christ. The Redeemer will
          not accept divided service. Daily he must learn the meaning of <nobr>self-surrender.</nobr> He must study the
          Word of God, getting its meaning and obeying its precepts. Thus he may reach the highest standard of Christian
          excellence. There is no limit to the spiritual advancement that he may make if he is a partaker of the divine
          nature. Day by day God works in him, perfecting the character that is to stand in the day of final test. Each
          day of his life he ministers to others. The light that is in him shines forth and stills the strife of
          tongues. Day by day he is working out before men and angels a vast, sublime experiment, showing what the
          gospel can do for fallen human beings.</p>
      <p>Let us not spare ourselves, but carry forward in earnest the work of reform that must be done in our lives. Let
          us crucify self. Unholy habits will clamor for the mastery, but in the name and through the power of Jesus we
          may conquer. To him who daily seeks to keep his heart with all diligence, the promise is given, “Neither
          death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
          height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
          Christ Jesus our Lord” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.8.38"><span class="ft17">Romans
          8:38, 39</span></a>).... God Himself is “the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” And</p>
      <p>“whom he justified, them he also glorified” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.8.30"><span
          class="ft9">verse 30</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Great as is the shame and degradation through sin, even greater will be the honor and exaltation through
          redeeming love. To human beings, striving for conformity to the divine image, there is imparted an outlay of
          heaven’s treasure, an excellency of power that will place them higher than</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[149]</span><span class="ft27">even the angels who have never fallen.</span></p>
