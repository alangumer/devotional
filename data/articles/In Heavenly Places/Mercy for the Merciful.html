    <h1>Mercy for the Merciful, August 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.6.36"><span class="ft9">Luke 6:36</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Mercy is an attribute that the human agent may share with God. As did Christ, so man may lay hold on the divine
          arm and be in communication with divine power. To us has been given a service of mercy to perform for our
          fellow man. In performing this service, we are laboring together with God. We do well, then, to be merciful,
          even as our Father in heaven is merciful.</p>
      <p>“I will have mercy,” God says, “and not sacrifice” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.9.13"><span class="ft21">Matthew 9:13</span></a>). Mercy is
          kind, pitiful. Mercy and the love of God purify the soul, beautify the heart, and cleanse the life from
          selfishness. Mercy is a manifestation of divine love and is shown by those who, identified with God, serve Him
          by reflecting the light of heaven upon the pathway of their fellow creatures. The condition of many persons
          calls for the exercise of genuine mercy. Christians, in their dealing with one another, are to be controlled
          by principles of mercy and love. They are to improve every opportunity for helping fellow beings in
          distress....</p>
      <p>Let those who desire to perfect a Christlike character ever keep in view the cross on which Christ died a cruel
          death in order to redeem mankind. Let them ever cherish the same merciful spirit that led the Saviour to make
          an infinite sacrifice for our redemption....</p>
      <p>The merciful “shall obtain mercy” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.5.7"><span
          class="ft10">Matthew 5:7</span></a>). “The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be
          watered also himself” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.11.25"><span
          class="ft10">Proverbs 11:25</span></a>). There is sweet peace for the compassionate spirit, a blessed
          satisfaction in the life of <nobr>self-forgetful</nobr> service for the good of others.</p>
      <p>He who has given his life to God in ministry to His children is linked with Him who has all the resources of
          the universe at His command. By the golden chain of the immutable promises his life is bound up with the life
          of God. The Lord will not fail him in the hour of suffering and need. “My God shall supply all your need
          according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Philippians.4.19"><span class="ft21">Philippians 4:19</span></a>).
          And in the hour of final need the merciful shall find refuge in the mercy of the compassionate Saviour
          and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[239]</span><span class="ft27">by Him shall be received into everlasting
          habitations.</span></p>
