    <h1>Armed for the Conflict, September 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
          having done all, to stand.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.6.13">Ephesians 6:13</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>There are many who do not understand the conflict that is going on between Christ and Satan over the souls of
          men. They do not realize that if they would stand under the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Prince
          Emmanuel they must be willing to be partakers of His conflicts and wage a determined war against the powers of
          darkness.</p>
      <p>When thinking on the conflict, Paul writes to his Ephesian brethren exhorting them to “be strong,” not feeble,
          not wavering, tossed to and fro like the waves of the sea. But in what are they to be strong? In their own
          might? No. “Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.” He says, “Put on the whole armour of God,
          that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
          against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
          wickedness in high places ...” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.6.10"><span

      <p>The gaining of eternal life will ever involve a struggle, a conflict. We are continually to be found fighting
          the good fight of faith. We are soldiers of Christ; and those who enlist in His army are expected to do
          difficult work, work which will tax their energies to the utmost. We must understand that a soldier’s life is
          one of aggressive warfare, of perseverance and endurance. For Christ’s sake we are to endure trials.</p>
      <p>Victories are not gained by ceremonies or display but by simple obe- dience to the highest General, the Lord
          God of heaven. He who trusts in this Leader will never know defeat. Obedience to God is liberty from the
          thraldom of sin, deliverance from human passion and impulse. Man may stand conqueror of himself, conqueror of
          his own inclinations, conqueror of principalities and powers, and of the “rulers of the darkness of this
          world,” and of “spiritual wickedness in high places.” ...</p>
      <p>“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[260]</span><span class="ft27">able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
          stand.”</span></p>
