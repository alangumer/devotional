      <p><strong>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit
          of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Galatians.6.1"><span class="ft6">Galatians
          6:1</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>God is love, God is life. It is the prerogative of God to redeem, reconstruct, and restore. Before the
          foundation of the world the Son of God was given to die, and redemption is the mystery that was “kept in
          silence through times eternal” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.16.25"><span
          class="ft40">Romans 16:25</span></a>, R.V.). Yet sin is unexplainable, and no reason can be found for its
          existence. No soul knows what God is until he sees himself a sinner in the light from the cross of Calvary;
          but when in his great need he cries out for a <nobr>sin-pardoning</nobr> Saviour, God is revealed to him as
          gracious and merciful, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> and abundant in goodness and truth. The work of Christ is
          to redeem, to restore, to seek and to save that which was lost. If we are connected with Christ, we also are
          partakers of the divine nature and are to be laborers together with God. We are to bind up the bruised and
          wounded soul; and if a brother or a sister has erred, we are not to join with the enemy in destroying and
          ruining, but to work with Christ to restore such a one in the spirit of meekness.</p>
      <p>The foundation of our hope in Christ is the fact that we recognize ourselves as sinners in need of restoration
          and redemption. It is because we are sinners that we have courage to claim Him as our Saviour. Then let us
          take heed lest we deal with the erring in a way that would say to others that we have no need of redemption.
          Let us not denounce, condemn, and destroy as though we were faultless. It is the work of Christ to mend, to
          heal, to restore. God is love.... He ... gives Satan no occasion for</p>
      <p>triumphing by making the worst appear or by exposing our weaknesses to our enemies.</p>
      <p>Christ came to bring salvation within the reach of all.... The most</p>
      <p>erring, the most sinful, were not passed by; His labors were especially for those who most needed the salvation
          He came to bring. The greater their need of reform, the deeper was His interest, the greater His sympathy, and
          the more earnest His labors. His great heart of love was stirred to its depths for the ones whose condition
          was most hopeless and who most</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[292]</span><span class="ft27">needed His transforming grace.</span></p>
