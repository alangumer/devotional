    <h1>The Christian’s Pledge of Allegiance, July 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye
          should be mine. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Leviticus.20.26"><span class="ft6">Leviticus
          20:26</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The character of the one who comes to God in faith will bear witness that the Saviour has entered into his
          life, directing all, pervading all. Such a one is continually asking, “Is this thy will and way, O my
          Saviour?” Constantly he looks to Jesus.... He consults the will of his divine Friend</p>
      <p>in reference to all his actions, for he knows that in this confidence is his strength. He has made it a habit
          to lift up the heart to God in every perplexity, every uncertainty.</p>
      <p>He who accepts God as his sovereign must take the oath of allegiance to Him. He must put on the Christian
          uniform and bear aloft the banner that shows to whose army he belongs. He must make an open avowal of his
          allegiance to Christ. Concealment is impossible. Christ’s impress must appear on the life in sanctified
          works.</p>
      <p>“I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other peo- ple.” “Ye shall be holy unto me: for I the
          Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.” “The very God of peace sanctify
          you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our
          Lord Jesus Christ.” “This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.” “Ye are a chosen
          generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of
          him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Leviticus.20.24"><span class="ft21">Leviticus 20:24, 26</span></a>;
          <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Thessalonians.5.23"><span class="ft21">1 Thessalonians
          5:23</span></a>; <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.43.21"><span class="ft21">Isaiah

      <p>Complete subjection through Christ to the will of God is our only safety. The selfish thoughts and impulses
          that sweep through the soul, producing discordant notes, can be separated from the life only as the whole
          being is under the control of Christ. The Saviour’s words to all unruly elements is, “Peace, be still.” Christ
          welcomes all who accept Him as their Saviour, and rules over them as their king.... Our zeal for the</p>
      <p>advancement of God’s kingdom is to mark us as faithful subjects of the cross of Christ. God can trust as His
          representatives those who implicitly</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[190]</span><span class="ft27">obey Him.</span></p>
