    <h1>“Our Reasonable Service”, July 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
          sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.12.1"><span class="ft6">Romans 12:1</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The apostle entreats his brethren to consecrate their bodies to God....</p>
      <p>When we pursue a course to lessen mental and physical <nobr>vigor—in</nobr> eating, drinking, or in any of our
          <nobr>habits—we</nobr> dishonor God, for we rob Him of the service He claims of us. When we indulge appetite
          at the expense of health, or when we indulge habits which lessen our vitality and mental vigor, we cannot have
          a high appreciation of the atonement and a right estimate of eternal things.</p>
      <p>When our minds are beclouded and partially paralyzed by disease we are easily overcome by the temptations of
          Satan. Eating of unhealthful food to gratify the appetite has a direct tendency to unbalance the cir- culation
          of the blood, cause nervous debility, and as the result there is great lack of patience and true, elevated
          affection. Constitutional strength, as well as the tone of the morals and the mental faculties, is enfeebled
          through the indulgence of perverted appetite....</p>
      <p>All the treasures of the world sink into insignificance when compared to the value of the mental and moral
          powers. And the healthful action of these faculties is dependent upon the physical health. Then how important
          that we know how to preserve health, that our duty to God and man may be performed according to His
          commandments. The laws of God are plain and distinct. No uncertainty beclouds any of them. None of them need
          ever be misunderstood. Those who cannot discern them are benumbed by their own wrong habits enfeebling their
          intellect.</p>
      <p>God designs to teach us the importance of temperance in all things. As intemperance caused the fall of our
          first parents from their holy and happy estate, by their transgressing the law of God, so temperance in all
          things will keep our faculties in as healthy a condition as possible, that no mist or uncertainty may becloud
          any of them, that intellect may guide to right actions in keeping His law.... We must work in harmony with
          natural</p>
      <p>laws if we would discern the binding claims of the law of God spoken</p>
