    <h1>The Peril of Riches, October 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to
          enter into the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man
          to enter into the kingdom of God. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Mark.10.24"><span
          class="ft6">Mark 10:24, 25</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>It is God’s plan that riches should be used properly, distributed to bless the needy and to advance the work of
          God. If men love their riches better than they love their fellow men, better than they love God or the truths
          of His Word, if their hearts are on their riches, they cannot have eternal life.... Here souls are proved; and
          like the rich young man, many go away</p>
      <p>sorrowful because they cannot have their riches and a treasure in heaven too....</p>
      <p>“With God all things are possible” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Mark.10.27"><span
          class="ft9">verse 27</span></a>).... Truth, sent home to</p>
      <p>the heart by the Spirit of God, will crowd out the love of riches. The love of Jesus and the love of money
          cannot dwell in the same heart. The love of God so far surpasses the love of money that the possessor breaks
          away from his riches and transfers his affections to God. Through love he is then led to minister to the wants
          of the needy and to assist the cause of God. It is his highest pleasure to make a right disposition of his
          Lord’s goods. He holds all that he has as not his own, and faithfully discharges his duty as God’s steward....
          In this way it is possible for a rich man to</p>
      <p>enter the kingdom of God....</p>
      <p>Some give of their abundance, yet feel no lack. They do not practice <nobr>self-denial</nobr> for the cause of
          Christ. They give liberally and heartily, but they still have all that heart can wish. God regards it. The
          action and motive are strictly marked by Him, and they will not lose their reward.</p>
      <p>But those who have less means must not excuse themselves because they cannot do as much as some others. Do what
          you can. Deny yourself of some article you can do without and sacrifice for the cause of God. Like the poor
          widow, cast in your two mites. You will actually give more than all those who give of their abundance; and you
          will know how sweet it is to deny self, to give to the needy, to sacrifice for the truth, and to lay</p>
