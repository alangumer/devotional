    <h1>The Home a School, July 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will</strong></p>
      <p>not depart from it. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.22.6"><span class="ft9">Proverbs
          22:6</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The home is to be a school in which children are to be trained for the higher school. The father and mother
          should make the decision, “I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.... I will walk within my house</p>
      <p>with a perfect heart” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.101.2"><span class="ft9">Psalm
          101:2</span></a>).... Parents are the first teachers of their</p>
      <p>children, and by the lessons that they give, they, as well as their children, are being educated. As parents
          consecrate themselves, body, soul, and spirit, to the doing of their <nobr>God-given</nobr> work, the Lord
          will teach them precious lessons, giving them wise words to speak and helping them to show patience and
          forbearance under provocation....</p>
      <p>We need homes that are surrounded by a sanctified atmosphere. Un- converted families are Satan’s strongest
          allies. The members of them work counter to God. Some parents are harsh, denunciatory, overbearing, while
          others are careless and overindulgent, letting their children follow the course of disobedience until they do
          very wicked things.... Such parents</p>
      <p>need to feel the converting power of God. By giving way to anger and by selfish indifference they unfit their
          children for this world and the next....</p>
      <p>I am writing this to the parents among us because I greatly desire them to learn, and to teach to their
          children, the beautiful lessons that we must learn on earth before we can enter heaven. In everything you do
          ask yourselves, “How will this help my children to prepare for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare
          for those who love Him?” When the work in the home school is done as it should be, families will bring into
          the church such a noble unselfishness that heavenly angels will love to linger there.... Hearts will be
          refined and purified, made fit for the indwelling of</p>
      <p>the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Keep Christ before your children by singing songs to His glory, by seeking Him in prayer, and by reading from
          His Word, so that He will seem to them an <nobr>ever-present</nobr> Guest. Then they will love Him, and will
          be brought so closely into unison with Him that they will breathe out His</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[210]</span><span class="ft27">Spirit. They will feel a new relationship to one another in
          Christ.</span></p>
