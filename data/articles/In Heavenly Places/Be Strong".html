    <h1>“Be Strong”, September 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.16.13"><span class="ft9">1</span></a></strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.16.13">Corinthians 16:13</a><span
          class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>Let all bear in mind that the Christian ministration is not a work for drones. God calls for men who will do
          and dare danger. Hold no parleying with Satan, but meet him with “It is written.” “Quit you like men, be
          strong.” Faith alone, unfeigned, can be the basis of our actions and prove by a clean, pure example that it is
          possible to be active, “Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.12.11"><span class="ft17">Romans 12:11</span></a>), and then
          all commercial enterprises will be conducted on Bible principles....</p>
      <p>We wish to repeat over and over again, until it is indelibly imprinted upon the heart, the blessed invitation,
          Abide in Me. Read the Word, and in the light of a “Thus saith the Lord,” meditate upon it. Pray until the
          lesson and meaning of abiding in is fully learned, accompanied with its claims and its promises. The Holy
          Spirit, Christ’s representative, is now in our world to bring all things to our remembrance, that His claims
          shall not be forgotten or neglected. Read the Word and pray. Meditate on the Scriptures until the
          understanding, the gate to the door to the heart, is opened to comprehend its requirements and our dependence.
          Those who will wait to hear what the Spirit saith unto them shall not hear in vain. Fix the eye upon Christ
          alone in quiet waiting upon Him to hear His voice saying, “Abide in me, and I in you.” ...</p>
      <p>There are many who come to the Saviour in a feeble way. They receive baptism and yet there is no apparent
          change in their character. We would invite all to come, all to abide in Christ, to advance daily in the
          perfection of character by abiding in Christ. As they do this, they find that rest that can come only through
          perfect obedience.</p>
      <p>But I warn you, be careful how you settle down in the middle walk between spirituality and worldliness. “Ye
          cannot serve God and mammon” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.6.24"><span
          class="ft17">Matthew 6:24</span></a>). You will be wholly on one side or the other.... Christ</p>
      <p>draws to His side; Satan hangs out every attraction to draw on his side.</p>
