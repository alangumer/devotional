      <p><strong>That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones,
          polished after the similitude of a palace. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.144.12"><span
          class="ft6">Psalm 144:12</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Let not parents forget the great mission field that lies before them in the home. In the children committed to
          her, every mother has a sacred charge from God. “Take this son, this daughter,” God says, “and train it for
          Me. Give it a character polished after the similitude of a palace, that it may shine in the courts of the Lord
          forever.”</p>
      <p>Let the determination of each member of the family be, I will be a Christian, for in the school here below I
          must form a character that will give me entrance into the higher grade, even the school above. I must do unto
          others as I desire them to do to me.</p>
      <p>Make the home life as nearly as possible like heaven. Let the members of the family forget not, as they gather
          round the family altar, to pray for the men in positions of responsibility in God’s work. The physicians in
          our sanitariums, the ministers of the gospel, those in charge of our publishing houses and schools, need your
          prayers. They are tempted and tried. As you plead with God to bless them, your own hearts will be subdued and
          softened by His grace. We are living amid the perils of the last days, and we are to cleanse ourselves from
          all defilement and put on the robe of Christ’s righteousness.</p>
      <p>My brother, my sister, I urge you to prepare for the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven. Day by day cast
          the love of the world out of your hearts. Understand by experience what it means to have fellowship with
          Christ. Prepare for the judgment, that when Christ shall come, to be admired in all them that believe, you may
          be among those who will meet Him in peace. In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the
          Father and the Son. The angels, touching their golden harps, will welcome the King and His trophies of
          <nobr>victory—those</nobr> who have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph
          will peal forth, filling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts, accompanied by His
          redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[212]</span><span class="ft27">suffering and sacrifice has not been in vain.</span></p>
