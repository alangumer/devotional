      <p><strong>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you
          all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.14.26"><span class="ft6">John 14:26</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The Comforter that Christ promised to send after He ascended to heaven is the Spirit in all the fullness of the
          Godhead, making manifest the power of divine grace to all who receive and believe in Christ as a personal
          Saviour. There are three living persons of the heavenly trio; in the name of these three great
          <nobr>powers—the</nobr> Father, the Son, and the Holy <nobr>Spirit—those</nobr> who receive Christ by living
          faith are baptized and these powers will cooperate with the obedient.</p>
      <p>Those who have been privileged to hear the truth, and have been impressed by the Holy Spirit to receive the
          Holy Scriptures as the voice of God, have no excuse for becoming dwarfs in the religious life. By exercising
          the ability which God has given, they are to be daily learning and daily receiving spiritual fervor and
          power....</p>
      <p>If we would be growing plants in the Lord’s garden, we must have a constant supply of spiritual life and
          earnestness. Growth will then be seen in the faith and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. There is no halfway
          house where we may throw off responsibility and rest by the way. We are to keep advancing heavenward,
          developing a solid religious character. The measure of the Holy Spirit we receive will be proportioned to the
          measure of our desire and the faith exercised for it....</p>
      <p>Christ says, “Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.7.8"><span class="ft17">Matthew 7:8</span></a>). He who
          truly seeks for the precious grace of Christ will be sure not to be disappointed. This promise has been given
          to us by Him who will not deceive us. It is not stated as a maxim or a theory, but as a fact, as a law of the
          divine government. We can be assured that we shall receive the Holy Spirit if we individually try the
          experiment of testing God’s word. God is true; His order is perfect.... Light and truth</p>
      <p>will shine forth according to the desire of the soul. O that all would hunger</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[337]</span><span class="ft27">and thirst after righteousness, that they might be
          filled!</span></p>
