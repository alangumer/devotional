    <h1>No One Free from Temptation, September 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
          Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
          temptations. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.1.5"><span class="ft6">1 Peter 1:5,
          6</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Do not think that the Christian life is free from temptation. Tempta- tions will come to every Christian. Both
          the Christian and the one who does not accept Christ as his leader will have trials. The difference is that
          the latter is serving a tyrant, doing his mean drudgery, while the Christian is serving the One who died to
          give him eternal life. Do not look upon trial as something strange, but as the means by which we are to be
          purified and strengthened. “Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,” James admonishes; “knowing
          this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.1.2"><span class="ft21">James 1:2, 3</span></a>).</p>
      <p>In the future life we shall understand things that here greatly perplex us. We shall realize how strong a
          helper we had and how angels of God were commissioned to guard us as we followed the counsel of the Word of
          God.</p>
      <p>To all who receive Him, Christ will give power to become the sons of God. He is a present help in every time of
          need. Let us be ashamed of our wavering faith. Those who are overcome have only themselves to blame for their
          failure to resist the enemy. All who choose can come to Christ and find the help they need.</p>
      <p>There stands among you the mighty Counselor of the ages, inviting you to place your confidence in Him. Shall we
          turn away from Him to uncertain human beings, who are as wholly dependent on God as we ourselves are? Have we
          fallen so far below our privileges? Have we not been guilty of expecting so little that we have not asked for
          what God is longing to give?</p>
      <p>“I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord
          hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel.... For he said, Surely they</p>
      <p>are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour. In all their affliction he was afflicted,
          and the angel of his presence saved them”</p>
