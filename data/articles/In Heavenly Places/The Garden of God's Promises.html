    <h1>The Garden of God’s Promises, April 28</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of</strong></p>
      <p>God, ye might receive the promise. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.10.36"><span
          class="ft9">Hebrews 10:36</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The promises of God are like precious flowers scattered through a garden. The Lord would have us linger over
          them, looking closely into them, taking in their loveliness, and appreciating the favor that God has bestowed
          upon us by making such rich provisions for our needs. Were it not for contemplation of the promises of God, we
          could not understand the gracious love and compassion of God toward us or realize how rich were the treasures
          prepared for those who love Him. He would have the soul encouraged to repose in faith upon Him, the only
          sufficiency of the human agent.</p>
      <p>We are to send our petitions through the darkest clouds that Satan may cast over us, and let our faith pierce
          to the throne of God encircled by the rainbow of promise, the assurance that God is true, that in Him is no
          variableness neither shadow of turning. The answer may appear to be de- layed, but it is not so. The petition
          is accepted, and the answer given when it is essential for the best good of the petitioner and when the
          fulfillment of the request will work most for our eternal interest. God scatters His blessings all along our
          path to brighten our heavenward journey....</p>
      <p>We are to come before the mercy seat with reverence, calling up to our mind the promises that God has given,
          contemplating the goodness of God, and offering up thankful praises for His unchangeable love. We are not to
          trust in our finite prayers, but in the word of our heavenly Father, in His assurance of His love for us.
          Believing the promise of His unchanging love, we press our petitions to the throne of grace. Our faith may be
          tested by delay, but the prophet has given instruction as to what we should do. He says, “Who is among you
          that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let
          him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.50.10"><span class="ft19">Isaiah 50:10</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Wait upon the Lord; He has made the promise and is back of the assurance.... He who hungers and thirsts after
          righteousness will be filled. <span class="ft51">[126]</span></p>
