      <p><strong>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise</strong></p>
      <p>also the wife unto the husband. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.7.3"><span

      <p>Husbands and wives should feel it their privilege and their duty to reserve for the privacy of each otherâ€™s
          society the interchange of love tokens between themselves. For while the manifestation of love for each other
          is right in its place, it may be made productive of harm to both the married and the unmarried. There are
          persons of an entirely different cast of mind and character, and of different education and training, who love
          each other just as devotedly and healthfully as do those who have educated themselves to manifest their
          affection freely; and there is danger that by contrast these persons who are more reserved will be misjudged,
          and placed at a disadvantage. While the wife should lean on her husband with respect and deference, she can,
          in a wholesome, healthful way, manifest her strong affection for and confidence in the man she has chosen as
          her life companion....</p>
      <p>It is the high privilege and the solemn duty of Christians to make each other happy in their married life; but
          there is positive danger in making self all absorbing, pouring out all the wealth of affection upon each
          other, and being too well satisfied with such a life. All this savors of selfishness.</p>
      <p>Instead of shutting up their love and sympathy to themselves, they should seize every opportunity of
          contributing to the good of others, distributing the abundance of affection in a chaste and sanctified love
          for souls that in the sight of God are just as precious as themselves, being purchased by the infinite
          sacrifice of His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son. Kind words, looks of sympathy, expressions of appreciation,
          would be to many a struggling and lonely one as the cup of cold water to a thirsty soul. A word of sympathy,
          an act of kindness, would lift burdens that are resting heavily upon some shoulders. And words of counsel,
          admonitions, warnings from a heart sanctified by love, are just as essential as an effusion of loving
          sentiments and expressions of appreciation. Every word or deed of unselfish kindness to souls with whom we are
          brought in connection is an expression of the love that Jesus has manifested for the whole human</p>
