    <h1>“What Manner of Persons?”, November 21</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of</strong></p>
      <p>persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</p>
      <p>looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God? <a

      <p>God expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent Him in thought, word, and deed. Their thoughts are
          to be pure and their words and deeds noble and uplifting, drawing those around them nearer to the Saviour....
          In a special sense <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists have been set in this</p>
      <p>world as watchmen and light bearers. To them has been entrusted the last message of mercy for a perishing
          world. On them is shining wonderful light from the Word of God. What manner of persons, then, ought they to
          be?</p>
      <p>Our lives should show steady spiritual growth. But I have seen that which makes me <nobr>tremble—men</nobr> and
          women dwarfed in character, pos- sessing the Word of God, which tells them what they must do in order to be
          saved, yet unsanctified and unholy....</p>
      <p>There needs to be a deeper work of grace in the hearts of God’s people. Less of self, and more of Christ, must
          be seen. Tests, close and sharp, are coming to all. The religion of the Bible must be interwoven with all that
          we do and say. Every business transaction must be fragrant with the presence of God....</p>
      <p>My brother, my sister, I urge you to prepare for the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven. Day by day cast
          the love of the world out of your hearts. Understand by experience what it means to have fellowship with
          Christ. Prepare for the judgment, that when Christ shall come, to be admired in all them that believe, you may
          be among those who will meet Him in peace. In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the
          Father and the Son. The angels, touching their golden harps, will welcome the King and His trophies of
          <nobr>victory—those</nobr> who have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph
          will peal forth, filling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts, accompanied by His
          redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[333]</span><span class="ft27">suffering and sacrifice has not been in vain.</span></p>
