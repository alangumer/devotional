    <h1>Standing in the Light of Heaven, March 4</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light
          of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.4.6"><span class="ft6">2 Corinthians
          4:6</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Provision has been made whereby the communication between heaven and our souls may be free and open. Finite man
          can place himself where rays of light and glory from the throne of God will be given him in abundance. The
          light of the knowledge of the glory of God which shines in the face of Jesus Christ may shine upon him. He may
          stand where it can be said of him, “Ye are the light of the world.” Were it not for the communication between
          heaven and earth there would be no light in the world. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, all men would perish beneath
          the just judgment of God. But the world is not left in darkness. The <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> mercy of God
          is still extended to the children of men, and it is His design that the rays of light which emanate from the
          throne of God shall be reflected by the children of light....</p>
      <p>It is our privilege to stand with the light of heaven upon us. It was thus that Enoch walked with God. It was
          no easier for Enoch to live a righteous life than it is for us at the present time. The world in his time was
          no more favorable to growth in grace and holiness than it is now.</p>
      <p>It was by prayer and communion with God that Enoch was enabled to escape the corruption that is in the world
          through lust. We are living in the perils of the last days, and we must receive our strength from the same
          Source. We must walk with God. A separation from the world is required of us, for we cannot remain free from
          its pollution unless we follow the example of the faithful Enoch....</p>
      <p>Those who profess the religion of Christ should understand the re- sponsibility resting upon them. They should
          feel that this is an individual work, an individual preaching of Christ. If each would realize this and take
          hold of the work, we should be as mighty as an army with banners. The heavenly Dove would hover over us. The
          light of the glory of God would be no more shut away from us than it was from the devoted Enoch. <span
