      <p><strong>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that</strong></p>
      <p>I desire beside thee. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.73.25"><span class="ft9">Psalm
          73:25</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The soul that cherishes the love of Christ is full of freedom, light, and joy in Christ. In such a soul there
          are no divided thoughts. The whole man yearns after God. He goes not to men for counsel, to know what is duty,
          but to the Lord Jesus, the source of all wisdom. He searches the Word of God that he may find out what
          standard has been set up.</p>
      <p>Can we ever find a surer guide than the Lord Jesus? True religion is embodied in the Word of God and consists
          in being under the guidance of the Holy One in thought, word, and deed. He who is the way, the truth, and the
          life takes the humble, earnest, wholehearted seeker and says, Follow Me. He leads him in the narrow way to
          holiness and heaven. Christ has opened this way for us at great cost to Himself. We are not left to stumble
          our way along in darkness. Jesus is at our right hand, proclaiming, I am the way. And all who decide to follow
          the Lord fully will be led in the royal path, yea more, the divine path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord
          to walk in.</p>
      <p>The more we learn of Christ through His Word, the more we feel our need of Him in our experience. We should not
          rest until we can rest in wearing the yoke of Christ and lifting His burdens. The more faithful we are in
          service to Him, the more we shall love Him, the more we shall magnify Him. Every duty, large or small, that we
          perform, will be done with faithfulness, and as we follow on to know the Lord the greater will be our desire
          to glorify Him.</p>
      <p>We are individually now testifying to the world of the power of the grace of Christ in the transformation of
          human character from glory to glory, from character to character. In beholding Christ our pattern, who is pure
          and holy and undefiled, we are being prepared for the society of the heavenly angels. If Christ is to be our
          head and Prince in the heavenly courts, it becomes us to inquire, What is Christ to us now? Can we say as we
          contemplate our Redeemer, “Whom have I in heaven but thee? and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[143]</span><span class="ft27">there is none upon earth that I desire beside
          thee”?</span></p>
