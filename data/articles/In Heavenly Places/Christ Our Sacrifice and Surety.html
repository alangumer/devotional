    <h1>Christ Our Sacrifice and Surety, February 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live
          unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.2.24"><span class="ft6">1 Peter
          2:24</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>If for some crime that you had committed you were incarcerated within prison walls, with the sentence of death
          passed upon you, and a friend should come to you and say, “I will take your place, and you may go free,” would
          not your heart be filled with gratitude for such unselfish love? Christ has done infinitely more than this for
          us. We were lost; the sentence of death had been passed upon us; and Christ died for us, and thus set us free.
          He said, “I will take upon Myself the guilt of the sinner, that he may have another trial. I will put within
          his reach power that will enable him to overcome in the struggle with evil.”</p>
      <p>This is where human beings stand today. Christ has bought us with His life, and we belong to Him. All our
          powers, physical, mental, and spiritual, belong to Him; and to withhold from Him that which is His own is
          robbery.</p>
      <p>Imagine, if possible, the nature and degree of Christ’s sufferings. This suffering in humanity was to prevent
          the outpouring of the wrath of God upon the whole of those for whom Christ died. Yea, for the church this
          great sacrifice will be efficacious throughout eternity. Can we compute the amount of her transgression in
          figures? Impossible. Then who can approach unto a conception of what Christ has endured when standing in the
          place of surety for His church ...? ... [He was] the only One who could bear the strokes in behalf of the
          sinner and because of His innocence not be consumed.... In the sacrifice of God’s <nobr>only-begotten</nobr>
          Son is demonstrated</p>
      <p>the awful glory of divine justice and holiness.</p>
      <p>By pledging His own life Christ has made Himself responsible for every man and woman on the earth. He stands in
          the presence of God, saying, “Father, I take upon Myself the guilt of that soul. It means death to him if he
          is left to bear it. If he repents he shall be forgiven. My blood</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[43]</span><span class="ft27">shall cleanse him from all sin. I gave My life for the sins of
          the world.”</span></p>
