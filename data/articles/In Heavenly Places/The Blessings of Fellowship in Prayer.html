      <p><strong>Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a
          book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Malachi.3.16"><span class="ft6">Malachi
          3:16</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>If Christians would associate together, speaking to each other of the love of God, and of the precious truths
          of redemption, their own hearts would be refreshed, and they would refresh one another. We may be daily
          learning more of our heavenly Father, gaining a fresh experience of His grace; then we shall desire to speak
          of His love; and as we do this, our own hearts will be warmed and encouraged. If we thought and talked more of
          Jesus and less of self, we should have far more of His presence.</p>
      <p>Let small companies assemble in the evening, at noon, or in the early morning to study the Bible. Let them have
          a season of prayer, that they may be strengthened, enlightened, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.... If</p>
      <p>you yourselves will open the door to receive it, a great blessing will come to you. Angels of God will be in
          your assembly. You will feed upon the leaves of the tree of life.</p>
      <p>The fact that the Lord has been represented as hearkening to the words spoken by His witnesses, tells us that
          Jesus is in our very midst. He says, “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
          midst.” One person is not to do all the witnessing for Jesus, but every one who loves God is to testify of the
          preciousness of His grace and truth.</p>
      <p>Praying together will bind hearts to God in bonds that will endure; confessing Christ openly and bravely,
          exhibiting in our characters His meekness, humility, and love, will charm others with the beauty of holi-
          ness.</p>
      <p>God will remember those who have met together and thought upon His name, and He will spare them from the great
          conflagration. They will be as precious jewels in His sight.... It is not a vain thing to serve God.</p>
      <p>There is a priceless reward for those who devote their life to His service. <span class="ft45">[93]</span></p>
