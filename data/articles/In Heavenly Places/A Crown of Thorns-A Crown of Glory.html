    <h1>Would You Be Ready? December 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the</strong></p>
      <p>Son of man cometh. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.24.44"><span class="ft9">Matthew
          24:44</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Suppose that today Christ should appear in the clouds of heaven, who</p>
      <p>... would be ready to meet Him? Suppose we should be translated into the kingdom of heaven just as we are.
          Would we be prepared to unite with the saints of God, to live in harmony with the royal family, the children
          of the heavenly King? What preparation have you made for the judgment? Have you made your peace with God? ...
          Are you seeking to help those around you, those in your home, those in your neighborhood, those with whom you
          come in contact that are not keeping the commandments of God?</p>
      <p>... Remember that profession is worthless without a practice that enters into the daily life. God knows whether
          we are keeping His law in truth. He knows just what we are doing, just what we are thinking and saying. Are we
          getting ready to meet the King? When He comes in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, will you be
          able to say, “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.25.9"><span class="ft21">Isaiah 25:9</span></a>)? To those
          who can say this Christ will say, “Come up higher. Upon this earth you have loved Me. You have loved to do My
          will. You can now enter the Holy City and receive the crown of everlasting life.”</p>
      <p>If it were possible for us to be admitted into heaven as we are, how many of us would be able to look upon God?
          How many of us have on the wedding garment? How many of us are without spot or wrinkle or any such thing?
          ...</p>
      <p>This is our washing and ironing <nobr>time—the</nobr> time when we are to cleanse our robes of character in the
          blood of the Lamb. John says, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.1.29"><span class="ft39">John 1:29</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>Shall we not let our sins go? ...</p>
      <p>I entreat you, brethren and sisters, to labor earnestly to secure the crown of everlasting life. The reward
          will be worth the conflict, worth the effort.... In the race in which we are running, everyone may receive
          the</p>
      <p>reward <nobr>offered—a</nobr> crown of everlasting life. I want this crown; I mean by God’s help to have it. I
          mean to hold fast to the truth, that I may see the</p>
