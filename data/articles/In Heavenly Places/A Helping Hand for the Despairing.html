    <h1>A Helping Hand for the Despairing, October 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; let him know, that he which
          converteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of
          sins. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.5.19"><span class="ft6">James 5:19,
          20</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many who err and who feel their shame and folly. They look upon their mistakes and errors until they
          are driven almost to desperation. These souls we are not to neglect. When one has to swim against the stream,
          there is all the force of the current driving him back. Let a helping hand then be held out to him as was the
          Elder Brother’s hand to the sinking Peter. Speak to him hopeful words....</p>
      <p>Thy brother, sick in spirit, needs thee as thou thyself has needed a brother’s love. He needs the experience of
          one who has been as weak as he, one who can sympathize with him and help him. The knowledge of our own
          weakness should help us to help another in his need. Never should we pass by one suffering soul without
          seeking to impart to him the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</p>
      <p>It is fellowship with Christ, personal contact with a living Saviour, that enables the mind and heart and soul
          to triumph over the lower nature. Tell the wanderer of an almighty Hand that will hold him up, of an infinite
          humanity in Christ that pities him. It is not enough for him to believe in law and force, things that have no
          pity and never hear the call for help. He needs to clasp a hand that is warm, to trust in a heart full of
          tenderness. Keep his mind stayed on the thought of a divine presence ever beside him, ever looking upon him
          with pitying love. Bid him think of a Father’s heart that ever grieves over sin, of a Father’s hand stretched
          out still, of a Father’s voice saying, “Let him take hold of my strength, and make peace with me ...” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.27.5"><span class="ft10">Isaiah 27:5</span></a>).</p>
      <p>As you engage in this work you have companions unseen by human eyes. Angels of heaven were beside the Samaritan
          who cared for the wounded stranger. Angels from the heavenly courts stand by the side of all who do God’s
          service in ministering to their fellow men. And you have the cooperation of Christ Himself. He is the
          restorer, and as you</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[296]</span><span class="ft27">work under His supervision you will see great
          results.</span></p>
