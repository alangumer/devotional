    <h1>Building on Christ, May 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a
          precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.28.16"><span class="ft41">Isaiah
          28:16</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>“Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.3.11"><span class="ft10">1 Corinthians
          3:11</span></a>). “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Acts.4.12"><span class="ft10">Acts 4:12</span></a>). Christ the
          Word, the revelation of <nobr>God—the</nobr> manifestation of His character, His law, His love, His
          <nobr>life—is</nobr> the only foundation upon which we can build a character that will endure.</p>
      <p>We build on Christ by obeying His word. It is not he who merely enjoys righteousness, that is righteous, but he
          who does righteousness. Holiness is not rapture; it is the result of surrendering all to God; it is doing the
          will of our heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>Religion consists in doing the words of Christ; not doing to earn God’s favor, but because, all undeserving, we
          have received the gift of His love. Christ places the salvation of man, not upon profession merely, but upon
          faith that is made manifest in works of righteousness. “As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
          sons of God” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.8.14"><span class="ft17">Romans
          8:14</span></a>). Not those whose hearts are touched by the Spirit, not those who now and then yield to its
          power, but they that are led by the Spirit, are the sons of God.</p>
      <p>We are to be sons and daughters of God, growing into a holy temple in the Lord. “No more strangers and
          foreigners, but <nobr>fellow-citizens</nobr> with the saints, and of the household of God; ... built upon the
          foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.2.19"><span class="ft30">Ephesians 2:19, 20</span></a>).
          This is our privilege....</p>
      <p>Every character is to be weighed in the balances of the sanctuary; if the moral character and spiritual
          advancement do not correspond with the opportunities and blessings, “wanting” is written against the name. The
          Light of the world is our leader, and the path has been growing brighter and brighter as we have advanced in
          the footsteps of Jesus. O that we may keep close to our Leader! ... Those who humbly study the character
          of</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[131]</span><span class="ft27">Jesus will reflect His image more and more.</span></p>
