    <h1>“Arise, Shine”, November 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen</strong></p>
      <p>upon thee. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.60.1"><span class="ft9">Isaiah
          60:1</span></a>.</p>
      <p>In a special sense <nobr>Seventh-day</nobr> Adventists have been set in the world as watchmen and light
          bearers. To them has been entrusted the last message of mercy for a perishing world. On them is shining
          wonderful light from the Word of God. What manner of persons, then, ought they to be? ...</p>
      <p>It is the purpose of God to glorify Himself in His people before the world. He longs to make them channels
          through which He can pour His boundless love and mercy.... Let us come up to the help of the Lord, to the</p>
      <p>help of the Lord against the mighty powers of darkness. Satan is working with intensity of purpose to enslave
          and destroy souls. Let us take a firm stand against him. He who is fully consecrated to the service of God
          will be made strong for the battle. He will be strengthened with “all might.” He who feels his weakness, and
          wrestles with God as did Jacob, saying, “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Genesis.32.26"><span class="ft21">Genesis 32:26</span></a>), will go
          forth with the fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit. The atmosphere of heaven will surround him. He will go
          about doing good. His influence will be a positive force in favor of the religion of Christ.</p>
      <p>God calls for light bearers, who will fill the world with the light and peace and joy that come from Christ. He
          calls for humble men, men who cherish a sense of their weakness and who remember what the service of God
          demands of <nobr>them—the</nobr> propriety of speech and action which shows the power of the grace of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>Time is precious. The destiny of souls is in the balance. God is holding back His judgments, waiting for the
          message to be sounded to all. There are many who have not yet heard the testing message of truth for this
          time. The last call of mercy is to be proclaimed throughout the earth. Heavenly angels have long been waiting
          for human agents ... to cooperate with them in the great work to be done. They are waiting for you. So vast is
          the field, so comprehensive the design, that every sanctified heart will be pressed</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[315]</span><span class="ft27">into service as an agent of divine power.</span></p>
