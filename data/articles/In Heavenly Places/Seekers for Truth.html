    <h1>Seekers for Truth, November 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the
          behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Chronicles.16.9"><span class="ft6">2 Chronicles
          16:9</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>In every place, in regions afar as well as nearer home, there are God- fearing men and women searching for
          truth. They know that there is a God; they offer their prayers to Him; they trust Him; they act just as
          Christians act. From the story of Cornelius [<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Acts.10.1"><span
          class="ft21">Acts 10</span></a>] we learn that God will lead every one who is willing to be led. He led
          Cornelius. He drew out His servant’s heart in prayer. He prepared him to receive the light of His truth, and
          He chose to enlighten the mind of Cornelius through the agency of one who had already received light from
          above.... The Lord</p>
      <p>noticed every act of Cornelius. All heaven observed the giving of alms and the praying of this devout
          centurion....</p>
      <p>Thus it is today. The Lord has His eye upon every soul that is seeking Him. He is interested in every soul
          needing help, and He will not leave one in the darkness of error, but step by step will lead him into the full
          light of the truth that is shining from every page of the Scriptures.... The</p>
      <p>Lord sees our every act. He knows just what progress we have made in the Christian pathway. How kind, how
          tender, our Great Shepherd is! With intense interest He looks down from His exalted throne upon the sheep of
          His pasture, and gives them grace and strength....</p>
      <p>Constantly the heavenly agencies are communicating with men and women on the earth. We cannot see personally
          the angels of God round about us; nevertheless they are with us, guiding and directing. We are to be so fully
          under the influence of the Spirit of God that we shall be susceptible to His leadings.</p>
      <p>Whenever we are impressed to say or do something to help a fellow being, we should be ready to respond at once
          to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. We can be ready to do this only when we are living in close relation
          with God. The giving of alms, the earnest prayers offered, are but indications that we are doing the works of
          a Christian, and that we are</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[323]</span><span class="ft27">submitting our minds to the molding influence of God’s
          Spirit.</span></p>
