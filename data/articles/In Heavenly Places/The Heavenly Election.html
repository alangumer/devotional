      <p><strong>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do
          these things, ye shall never fall. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Peter.1.10"><span
          class="ft6">2 Peter 1:10</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>This is the only election regarding which the Bible speaks. Fallen in sin, we may become partakers of the
          divine nature and attain to a knowledge far in advance of any scientific learning. By partaking of the flesh
          and the blood of our crucified Lord, we shall gain life eternal. In the sixth of John we read: “Whoso eateth
          my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.6.54"><span class="ft10">John 6:54</span></a>). “It is the
          spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and
          they are life” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.6.63"><span class="ft10">verse
          63</span></a>).</p>
      <p>None need lose eternal life. Everyone who chooses daily to learn of the heavenly Teacher will make his calling
          and election sure. Let us humble our hearts before God and follow on to know Him whom to know aright is life
          eternal.</p>
      <p>“Give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so
          an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
          Christ” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Peter.1.10"><span class="ft10">2 Peter 1:10,
          11</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Here are your <nobr>life-insurance</nobr> papers. This is not an insurance policy the value of which someone
          else will receive after your death; it is a policy that assures you a life measuring with the life of
          <nobr>God—even</nobr> eternal life. O what an assurance! what a hope! Let us ever reveal to the world that we
          are seeking for a better country, even a heavenly. Heaven has been made for us, and we want a part in it. We
          cannot afford to allow anything to separate us from God and heaven. In this life we must be partakers of the
          divine nature. Brethren and sisters, you have only one life to live. O let it be a life of virtue, a life hid
          with Christ in God!</p>
      <p>Unitedly we are to help one another gain perfection of character. To this end, we are to cease all criticism.
          Onward and still onward we may advance toward perfection, until at last there will be ministered unto us
          an</p>
