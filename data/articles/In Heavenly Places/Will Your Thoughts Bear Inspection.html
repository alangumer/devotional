      <p><strong>The Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the</strong></p>
      <p>imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of</p>
      <p>thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. <a

      <p>You must give an account to God of your thoughts, of your words, of your time, and of your actions....</p>
      <p>You can never enter heaven unless you enjoy the communion of God here below, for this is our
          <nobr>fitting-up</nobr> place for heaven. God should be the object of the soul’s highest reverence, love, and
          fear. This world is the only school in which you can receive a preparation for the higher grade. Those who do
          not love to retain God in their thoughts in this world, those who consider it irksome to be in subjection to
          God in this life, will never have enjoyment with Christ in the future life. The very things they choose and
          love here in <nobr>self-pleasing</nobr> are educating their tastes so that heavenly discipline will be a
          restraint. Let your soul be brought under discipline to God....</p>
      <p>He who created man, who paid such a price for his redemption, is greatly dishonored when man chooses a low,
          earthly level, a life of frivolity and cheapness.... All who are content to turn away from that knowledge</p>
      <p>which will make them wise unto salvation in this life and the future, who accept of earthly, frivolous things,
          are feeding their souls upon brackish water when Jesus Christ invites them, “If any man thirst, let him come
          unto me, and drink” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.7.37"><span class="ft10">John
          7:37</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Let your soul be absorbed in meditating upon the glorious truths con- tained in the Word of God, and you will
          have no constant craving for something which you have not. You will despise cheap, vain thoughts. You will be
          ever trying to meet the elevated standard of virtue and ho- liness which is kept before you in the gospel. You
          will seek for higher attainments in the divine life. Converse with God through the medium of His Word....</p>
      <p>By contemplating the lofty ideal He has placed before you, you will be uplifted into a pure and holy
          atmosphere, even the presence of God. When you abide here, there goes forth from you a light which
          irradiates</p>
