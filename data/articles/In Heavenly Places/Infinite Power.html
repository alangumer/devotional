    <h1>Infinite Power, January 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who is this cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel,
          travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.63.1"><span class="ft6">Isaiah 63:1</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son of God came to this world to redeem the fallen race. He has given us
          evidence of His great power. He will enable those who receive Him to build up characters free from all the
          tendencies that Satan reveals. We can resist the enemy and all his forces. The battle will be won, the victory
          gained, by him who chooses Christ as his leader, determined to do right because it is right.</p>
      <p>Our divine Lord is equal to any emergency. With Him nothing is impossible. He has shown His great love for us
          by living a life of self- denial and sacrifice and by dying a death of agony. Come to Christ just as you
          are.... Cast yourself wholly on His mercy. There is no difficulty</p>
      <p>within or without that cannot be surmounted in His strength.</p>
      <p>Some have stormy tempers; but He who calmed the stormy Sea of Galilee will say to the troubled heart, “Peace,
          be still.” There is no nature so rebellious that Christ cannot subdue it, no temper so stormy that He cannot
          quell it, if the heart is surrendered to His keeping.</p>
      <p>He who commits his soul to Jesus need not despond. We have an <nobr>all-powerful</nobr> Saviour. Looking to
          Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith, you can say, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present
          help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried
          into the midst of the sea” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.46.1"><span class="ft10">Psalm
          46:1, 2</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>Let us have more confidence in our Redeemer. Turn not from the waters of Lebanon to seek refreshment at broken
          cisterns, which can hold no water. Have faith in God. Trustful dependence on Jesus makes victory not only
          possible but certain. Though multitudes are pressing on in the wrong way, though the outlook be ever so
          discouraging, yet we may have full assurance in our Leader; for “I am God,” He declares, “and there is none
          else” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.45.22"><span class="ft17">Isaiah 45:22</span></a>).
          He is infinite in power, and able to save all who</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[18]</span><span class="ft27">come to Him. There is no other in whom we can safely
          trust.</span></p>
