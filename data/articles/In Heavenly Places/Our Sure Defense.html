    <h1>Our Sure Defense, December 7</h1>

      <p><strong>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
          which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.3.10"><span class="ft41">Revelation
          3:10</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan is now more earnestly engaged in playing the game of life for souls than at any previous time; and unless
          we are constantly on our guard, he will establish in our hearts, pride, love of self, love of the world, and
          many other evil traits. He will also use every possible device to unsettle our faith in God and in the truths
          of His Word. If we have not a deep experience in the things of God, if we have not a thorough knowledge of His
          Word, we shall be beguiled to our ruin by the errors and sophistries of the enemy. False doctrines will sap
          the foundations of man, because they have not learned to discern truth from error. Our only safeguard against
          the wiles of Satan is to study the Scriptures diligently, to have an intelligent understanding of the reasons
          of our faith, and faithfully to perform every known duty. The indulgence of one known sin will cause weakness
          and darkness and subject us to fierce temptation....</p>
      <p>Are our supplications ascending to God in living faith? Are we open- ing the door of the heart to Jesus and
          closing every means of entrance to Satan? Are we daily obtaining clearer light and greater strength, that we
          may stand in Christ’s righteousness? Are we emptying our hearts of all selfishness, and cleansing them,
          preparatory to receiving the latter rain from heaven?</p>
      <p>Now is the time when we are to confess and forsake our sins, that they may go beforehand to judgment and be
          blotted out. Now is the time to “cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
          holiness in the fear of God” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.7.1"><span
          class="ft17">2 Corinthians 7:1</span></a>). It is dangerous to delay this work. Satan is even now seeking by
          disasters upon sea and land to seal the fate of as many as possible. What is the defense of the people of God
          at this time? It is a living connection with heaven. If we would dwell in safety from the noisome pestilence,
          if we would be preserved from dangers seen and unseen, we must hide in God; we must secure the</p>
