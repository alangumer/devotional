    <h1>Strength Through Prayer, March 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord</strong></p>
      <p>our maker. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.95.6"><span class="ft9">Psalm
          95:6</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Christ has given His disciples assurance that special seasons for de- votion are necessary. Prayer went before
          and sanctified every act of His ministry.... The night seasons of prayer which the Saviour spent in the</p>
      <p>mountain or in the desert were essential to prepare Him for the trials He must meet in the days to follow. He
          felt the need of the refreshing and invigorating of soul and body, that He might meet the temptations of
          Satan; and those who are striving to live His life will feel this same need....</p>
      <p>Christ has pledged Himself to be our substitute and surety, and He neglects no one. There is an inexhaustible
          fund of perfect obedience accruing from His obedience. In heaven His merits, His <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and
          <nobr>self-sacrifice,</nobr> are treasured up as incense to be offered up with the prayers of His people. As
          the sinner’s sincere, humble prayers ascend to the throne of God, Christ mingles with them the merits of His
          life of perfect obedience. Our prayers are made fragrant by this incense....</p>
      <p>Let all remember that the mysteries of God’s kingdom cannot be learned by reasoning. True faith, true
          <nobr>prayer—how</nobr> strong they are! The prayer of the Pharisee had no value, but the prayer of the
          publican was heard in the courts above, because it showed dependence reaching forth to lay hold of
          Omnipotence. Self was to the publican nothing but shame. Thus it must be with all who seek God. Faith and
          prayer are the two arms which the needy suppliant lays upon the neck of infinite Love....</p>
      <p>We speak with Jesus Christ as we walk by the way, and He says, “I am at thy right hand.” We may walk in daily
          companionship with Christ. When we breathe out our desire, it may be inaudible to any human ear, but that word
          cannot die away into silence nor can it be lost, though the activities of business are going on. Nothing can
          drown the soul’s desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery, to the heavenly
          courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and the prayer is</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[70]</span><span class="ft27">heard. Ask then; “Ask, and it shall be given you.”</span></p>
