    <h1>“More than Conquerors”, February 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that</strong></p>
      <p>loved us. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.8.37"><span class="ft9">Romans
          8:37</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Through the power that Jesus gives, we can be “more than conquerors.” But we cannot manufacture this power.
          Only through the Spirit of God can we receive it.</p>
      <p>We need a deep insight into the nature of Christ and into the mystery of His love, “which passeth knowledge”
          (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.3.19"><span class="ft10">Ephesians 3:19</span></a>).
          We are to live in the warm, genial rays of the Sun of Righteousness. Nothing but Christ’s loving compassion,
          His divine grace, His almighty power, can enable us to baffle the relentless foe and subdue the opposition of
          our own hearts. What is our strength? The joy of the Lord. Let the love of Christ fill our hearts, and then we
          shall be prepared to receive the power that He has for us.</p>
      <p>Let us thank God every day for the blessings that are ours. If the human agent will humble himself before God,
          . . realizing his utter inability to do the work that needs to be done in order that his soul may be purified;
          if he will cast away his own righteousness, Christ will abide in his heart. He will put His hand to the work
          of creating him anew, and will continue the work till he is complete in Him....</p>
      <p>Beholding Christ for the purpose of becoming like Him, the seeker after truth sees the perfection of the
          principles of God’s law, and he becomes dissatisfied with everything but perfection.... But he knows that</p>
      <p>with the Redeemer there is saving power that will gain for him the victory in the conflict. The Saviour will
          strengthen and help him as he comes pleading for grace and efficiency.</p>
      <p>Christ will never neglect the work that has been placed in His hands. He will inspire the resolute disciple
          with a sense of the perversity, the sin- stained condition, the depravity, of the heart upon which He is
          working. The true penitent learns the uselessness of <nobr>self-importance.</nobr> Looking to Jesus, comparing
          his own defective character with the Saviour’s perfect character, he says only—</p>
      <p>“In my hand no price I bring; Simply to Thy cross I cling.”</p>
