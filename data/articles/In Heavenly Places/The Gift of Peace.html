    <h1>The Gift of Peace, January 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
          Jesus. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Philippians.4.7"><span class="ft30">Philippians
          4:7</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued we can find no rest. The masterful passions of the heart
          no human power can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to control the raging storm. But He
          who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However fierce the
          tempest, those who turn to Jesus with the cry, “Lord, save us,” will find deliverance. His grace, which
          reconciles the soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart is at rest....
          “Being justified by faith, we have peace</p>
      <p>with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.5.1"><span
          class="ft6">Romans 5:1</span></a>). “The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness
          quietness and assurance for ever” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.32.17"><span
          class="ft6">Isaiah 32:17</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Whoever consents to renounce sin and open his heart to the love of Christ, becomes a partaker of this heavenly
          peace. There is no other ground of peace than this. The grace of Christ, received into the heart, subdues
          enmity; it allays strife and fills the soul with love. He who is at peace with God and his fellow men cannot
          be made miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil surmisings will find no room there; hatred cannot
          exist. The heart that is in harmony with God is a partaker of the peace of heaven and will diffuse its blessed
          influence on all around. The spirit of peace will rest like dew upon hearts weary and troubled with worldly
          strife.</p>
      <p>Christ’s followers are sent to the world with the message of peace. Whoever, by the quiet, unconscious
          influence of a holy life, shall reveal the love of Christ; whoever, by word or deed, shall lead another to
          renounce sin and yield his heart to God is a peacemaker.</p>
      <p>And “blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.5.9"><span class="ft40">Matthew 5:9</span></a>). The spirit
          of peace is evidence of their connection with heaven. The sweet savor of Christ surrounds them. The fragrance
          of the life, the loveliness of the character, reveal to the world the fact that they are children of God. Men
          take knowledge of them that they have</p>
