    <h1>To the Glory of God, November 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace
          of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Thessalonians.1.12"><span
          class="ft6">2 Thessalonians 1:12</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>It is our duty to be very jealous of the glory of God, and bring no evil report even by the sadness of the
          countenance or by the ill advised words, as though the requirements of God were a restriction upon our
          liberty. The whole person is privileged to bear a decided testimony in every <nobr>line—in</nobr> features, in
          temper, in words, in <nobr>character—that</nobr> the service of the Lord is good....</p>
      <p>God loves His <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people, because through their obedience they give honor to His
          holy name, testifying of their love for God.... Our faith and intensity of zeal should be proportionate to the
          great</p>
      <p>light which shines upon our pathway. Faith, humble, trusting faith in <nobr>God—in</nobr> our homes, in our
          neighborhood, in our <nobr>churches—will</nobr> reveal itself. The Holy Spirit’s working will not, cannot be
          hindered. God delights to reveal Himself to His people as a Father, as a God in whom they can trust
          implicitly....</p>
      <p>When the farmers seek to recommend or exhibit their products, they do not gather up the poorest but the best
          specimens. The women possess a zeal to bring the very best golden lumps of butter, molded and prettily
          stamped. The men bring the best yield of vegetables of every kind. The very best and most attractive fruit is
          brought, and their appearance does the skillful workers credit. The variety of <nobr>fruits—the</nobr> apples,
          peaches, apricots, oranges, lemons, and <nobr>plums—all</nobr> these are very attractive.... No</p>
      <p>one would bring the most dwarfed specimens, but the very choicest which the land can produce.</p>
      <p>And why should not Christians living in these last days reveal the most attractive fruit in unselfish actions?
          Why should not the fruit of the com- <nobr>mandment-keeping</nobr> people of God appear in the very best
          representation of good works? Their words, their deportment, their dress should bear fruit of the very best
          quality. By their fruits, Christ said, ye shall know them.... Let the church members have the precious traits
          of the character</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[327]</span><span class="ft27">of Christ.</span></p>
