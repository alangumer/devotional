    <h1>The Faith That Avails, April 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that</strong></p>
      <p>virtue is gone out of me. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.8.46"><span class="ft9">Luke
          8:46</span></a>.</p>
      <p>There are two kinds of connection between the branches and the vine. The one is deceptive, superficial.</p>
      <p>The crowd pressing upon Christ had no living union with Him by genuine faith. But a poor woman who had been
          many years a great sufferer and had spent all her living upon physicians but was made no better, but rather
          worse, thought if she could get within reach of Him, if she could only touch the hem of His garment, she would
          be made whole. Christ understood all that was in her heart, and He placed Himself where she could have the
          opportunity she desired. He would use that act to distinguish the touch of genuine faith from the casual
          contact of those who were crowding about Him....</p>
      <p>When the woman reached forth her hand and touched the hem of His garment, she thought this stealthy touch would
          not be known by anyone; but Christ recognized that touch and responded to her faith by His healing power. She
          realized in a moment that she was made whole, and the Lord Jesus would not let such faith pass unnoticed. He
          turned Him about quickly and said, “Who touched me?” All the disciples were pressing close around Him, and
          Peter said, “The multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? And Jesus said,
          Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.8.45"><span class="ft17">Luke 8:45, 46</span></a>).</p>
      <p>When the woman saw that she was not hid she came tremblingly and cast herself at His feet, telling the whole
          story. For twelve years she had been afflicted, but as soon as her finger touched the hem of His garment she
          was made whole. Jesus said to her, “Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace”
          (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.8.48"><span class="ft10">verse 48</span></a>). The mere
          touch of faith brought its reward.</p>
      <p>The faith which avails to bring us in vital contact with Christ expresses on our part supreme preference,
          perfect reliance, entire consecration....</p>
      <p>It works in the life of the follower of Christ true obedience to God’s commandments, for love to God and love
          to man will be the result of vital</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[109]</span><span class="ft27">connection with Christ.</span></p>
