      <p>God’s Word is our light. It is Christ’s message to His heritage, who have been bought with the price of His
          blood. It was written for our guidance, and if we make this Word our counselor, we shall never walk in strange
          paths. Our words, whether we are in the home or associating with those outside the home, will be kind,
          affectionate, and pure. If we study the Word and make it a part of our lives, we shall have a wholesome
          experience, which will always speak forth the truth. We shall search our hearts diligently, comparing our
          daily speech and tenor of life with the Word, that we may make no mistake.</p>
      <p>There are many in this age of the world who act as if they were at liberty to question the words of the
          Infinite, to review His decisions and statutes, endorsing, revising, reshaping, and annulling at their
          pleasure. We are never safe while we are guided by human opinions, but we are safe when we are guided by a
          “Thus saith the Lord.” We cannot trust the salvation of our souls to any lower standard than the decisions of
          an infallible Judge.</p>
      <p>Those who make God their guide and His Word their counselor, behold the lamp of life. God’s living oracles
          guide their feet in straight paths. Those who are thus led do not dare to judge the Word of God, but ever hold
          that His Word judges them. They get their faith and religion from the Word of the living God. It is the guide
          and counselor that directs their path. The Word is indeed a light to their feet and a lamp to their path. They
          walk under the direction of the Father of light, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. He
          whose tender mercies are over all His works makes the path of the just as a shining light, which shineth more
          and more unto the perfect day.</p>
      <p>The Bible is the voice of God to His people. As we study the living oracles, we are to remember that God is
          speaking to His people out of His Word.... If we realized the importance of searching the Scriptures, how</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[133]</span><span class="ft27">much more diligently we would study them!</span></p>
