    <h1>Trust When You Have Failed, April 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may
          apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Philippians.3.12"><span class="ft6">Philippians
          3:12</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>In order to fight successfully in the battle against sin, you must keep close to Jesus. Do not talk unbelief;
          you have no excuse for doing this....</p>
      <p>Unbelief always separates the soul from Christ.</p>
      <p>It is not praiseworthy to talk of our weakness and discouragement. Let each one say, “I am grieved that I yield
          to temptation, that my prayers are so feeble, my faith so weak. I have no excuse to plead for being dwarfed in
          my religious life. But I am seeking to obtain completeness of character in Christ. I have sinned, and yet I
          love Jesus. I have fallen many times, and yet He has reached out His hand to save me. I have told Him all
          about my mistakes. I have confessed with shame and sorrow that I have dishonored Him. I have looked to the
          cross, and have said, All this He suffered for me. The Holy Spirit has shown me my ingratitude, my sin in
          putting Christ to open shame. He who knows no sin has forgiven my sin. He calls me to a higher, nobler life,
          and I press on to the things that are before.” ...</p>
      <p>The humility that bears fruit, filling the soul with a sense of the love of God, will speak for the one who has
          cherished it, in the great day when men will be rewarded according as their works have been. Happy will be the
          one of whom it can be said, “The Spirit of God never stirred this man’s soul in vain. He went forward and
          upward from strength to strength. Self was not woven into his life. Each message of correction, warning, and
          counsel he received as a blessing from God. Thus the way was prepared for him to receive still greater
          blessings, because God did not speak to him in vain. Each step upward on the ladder of progress prepared him
          to climb still higher. From the top of the ladder the bright beams of God’s glory shone upon him. He did not
          think of resting, but sought constantly to attain the wisdom and righteousness of Christ. Ever he pressed
          toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”</p>
