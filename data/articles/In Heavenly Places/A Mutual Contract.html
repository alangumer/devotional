      <p><strong>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe

      <p>Salvation is secured by a mutual contract. “As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
          of God.” Will you, with all your heart and mind and soul, enter into this contract?</p>
      <p>Look to your Redeemer in faith and loving trust, for power and wisdom to do the work of character building. He
          sits as a refiner, to purify the gold and silver from all dross. Then look continually unto Him, and no cheap
          or worthless material will be brought into the structure of your character building.</p>
      <p>By faith you may accept the merits of the blood of the Son of God, which He has shed that the sinner might not
          perish, but have everlasting life. God has laid upon Him all power, that He may impart help to every one who
          will break with Satan and acknowledge Christ as his only hope....</p>
      <p>When you are ready to cooperate with Him who can keep you from falling, your resolutions will be of some value.
          Christ, the chief Healer, will make you whole. He works mightily with every one who is in earnest. He will
          give strength and victory. All the mean and wicked traits of character can be taken away by the One who has
          purchased you as His property....</p>
      <p>Make a break with the enemy. Cast yourselves loose from the prince of the power of the air and from the legion
          of his associates.</p>
      <p>Satan will resist the efforts of those who choose to stand on the Lord’s side. He will resort to every kind of
          deception to frustrate their efforts. But God has given His Son to bear the sins of those who seek His truth
          and righteousness. He stands ready to impart grace to every one who looks to Him in faith....</p>
      <p>The exercise of faith and manly courage will enlarge the comprehen- sion of what it means to be a Christian. We
          are to seek for that faith which works by love and purifies the soul. We shall have severe conflicts with our
          hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil. There must be a firm dependence upon the Captain of our
          salvation. He will not fail to do His</p>
