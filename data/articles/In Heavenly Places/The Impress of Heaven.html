      <p><strong>See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern</strong></p>
      <p>shewed to thee in the mount. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.8.5"><span
          class="ft9">Hebrews 8:5</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The Lord gave an important lesson to His people in all ages when to Moses on the mount He gave instruction
          regarding the building of the tabernacle. In that work He required perfection in every detail.</p>
      <p>As wickedness in the world becomes more pronounced and the teach- ings of evil are more fully developed and
          widely accepted, the teachings of Christ are to stand forth exemplified in the lives of converted men and
          women....</p>
      <p>Into all to which the Christian sets his hand should be woven the thought of the life eternal. If the work
          performed is agricultural or me- chanical in its nature, it may still be after the pattern of the
          heavenly....</p>
      <p>Through the grace of Christ every provision has been made for the per- fecting of Christlike characters, and
          God is honored when His people in all their social and business dealings reveal the principles of
          heaven....</p>
      <p>The Lord demands uprightness in the smallest as well as the largest matters. Those who are accepted at last as
          members of the heavenly court will be men and women who here on earth have sought to carry out the Lord’s will
          in every particular, who have sought to put the impress of heaven upon their earthly labors. In order that the
          earthly tabernacle might represent the heavenly, it must be perfect in all its parts, and it must be in the
          smallest detail like the pattern in the heavens. So it is with the characters of those who are finally
          accepted in the sight of Heaven.</p>
      <p>The Son of God came down to earth that in Him men and women might have a representation of the perfect
          characters which alone God could accept. Through the grace of Christ every provision has been made for the
          salvation of the human family. It is possible for every transaction entered into by those who claim to be
          Christians to be as pure as were the deeds of Christ. And the soul who accepts the virtues of Christ’s
          character and appropriates the merits of His life is as precious in the sight of God</p>
