    <h1>The Secret of Spiritual Power, March 17</h1>

      <p><strong>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they
          shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. <a

          40:31</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Much prayer is necessary to successful effort. Prayer brings power. Prayer has “subdued kingdoms, wrought
          righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, ...</p>
      <p>turned to flight the armies of the aliens” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.11.33"><span
          class="ft9">Hebrews 11:33, 34</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Jesus lived in dependence upon God and communion with Him. To the secret place of the Most High, under the
          shadow of the Almighty, men now and then repair; they abide for a season, and the result is manifest in noble
          deeds; then their faith fails, the communion is interrupted, and the lifework marred. But the life of Jesus
          was a life of constant trust, sustained by continual communion; and His service for heaven and earth was
          without failure or faltering.</p>
      <p>Christian workers can never attain the highest success until they learn the secret of strength. They must give
          themselves time to think, to pray, to wait upon God for a renewal of physical, mental, and spiritual power.
          They need the uplifting of His Spirit. Receiving this, they will be quickened by fresh life. The wearied frame
          and tired brain will be refreshed, the burdened heart will be rested.</p>
      <p>Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power. No other means of grace can be
          substituted, and the health of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart into immediate contact with the
          <nobr>Well-spring</nobr> of life, and strengthens the sinew and muscle of the religious experience.</p>
      <p>Family prayer and public prayer have their place, but it is secret com- munion with God that sustains the
          <nobr>soul-life.</nobr> It was in the mount with God that Moses beheld the pattern of that wonderful building
          which was to be the <nobr>abiding-place</nobr> of His glory. It is in the mount with <nobr>God—the</nobr>
          secret place of <nobr>communion—that</nobr> we are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. Thus we
          shall be enabled so to fashion our <nobr>character-building</nobr> that to us may be fulfilled the promise, “I
          will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.” (<a
