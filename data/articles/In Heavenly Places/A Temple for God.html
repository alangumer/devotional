    <h1>A Temple for God, July 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of</strong></p>
      <p>God dwelleth in you? <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.3.16"><span class="ft9">1
          Corinthians 3:16</span></a>.</p>
      <p>From eternal ages it was God’s purpose that every created being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should
          be a temple for the indwelling of the Creator. Because of sin, humanity ceased to be a temple for God....</p>
      <p>God designed that the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual witness to the high destiny open to every soul.
          But the Jews had not understood the significance of the building they regarded with so much pride.... The
          courts of the temple at Jerusalem, filled with the tumult of</p>
      <p>unholy traffic, represented all too truly the temple of the heart, defiled by the presence of sensual passion
          and unholy thoughts. In cleansing the Temple from the world’s buyers and sellers, Jesus announced His mission
          to cleanse the heart from the defilement of <nobr>sin—from</nobr> the earthly desires, the selfish lusts, the
          evil habits that corrupt the soul.... Only Christ can</p>
      <p>cleanse the soul temple.... His presence will cleanse and sanctify the soul,</p>
      <p>so that it may be a holy temple unto the Lord, and “an habitation of God through the Spirit” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.2.22"><span class="ft10">Ephesians 2:22</span></a>).</p>
      <p>By this beautiful and impressive figure God’s Word shows the regard He places on our physical organism and the
          responsibility resting upon us to preserve it in the best condition. Our bodies are Christ’s purchased
          possession, and we are not at liberty to do with them as we please. Man has done this. He has treated his body
          as if its laws had no penalty. Through perverted appetite its organs and powers have become enfeebled,
          diseased, crippled....</p>
      <p>When men and women are truly converted they will conscientiously regard the laws of life that God has
          established in their being, thus seeking to avoid physical, mental, and moral feebleness. Obedience to these
          laws must be made a matter of personal duty. We ourselves must suffer the ills of violated law. We must answer
          to God for our habits and practices. Therefore the question for us is not, “What will the world say?” but,
          “How</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[192]</span><span class="ft27">shall I, claiming to be a Christian, treat the habitation God
          has given me?”</span></p>
