    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance</strong></p>
      <p>of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the</p>
      <p>present truth. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Peter.1.12"><span class="ft9">2 Peter
          1:12</span></a>.</p>
      <p>No matter how long we may have been traveling in the way of life eternal we need often to recount the mercies
          of our heavenly Father toward us and gather hope and courage from the promises of His Word....Peter</p>
      <p>realized the value of constant vigilance in the Christian life, and he felt impelled by the Holy Spirit to urge
          upon the believers the importance of exercising great carefulness in the daily life....</p>
      <p>“Always in remembrance.” Oh, if only we were to keep before our minds those things that pertain to our eternal
          welfare, we should not engage in any foolishness or idle speaking! Our lifework is before us. It is for us to
          give diligence to make our calling and election sure, by giving heed to the plain instruction contained in
          God’s Holy Word....</p>
      <p>There are many wrong things which we allow to pass by unnoticed, when by our godly conversation we might set an
          example of rightdoing that would be a standing rebuke to the evildoers. We cannot afford by our example to
          seem to sanction wrongdoing. There is a heaven to win and a hell to shun. In large churches of believers...
          there is special danger of lowering the standard. Where many are gathered together some are more liable to
          grow careless and indifferent than they would be if isolated and made to stand alone. But even under adverse
          circumstances we may watch unto prayer and set an example in godly conversation that will be a powerful
          testimony for the right.... We cannot afford to speak words that</p>
      <p>would discourage our fellow pilgrims in the Christian pathway. Christ has given His life in order that we might
          live with Him in glory. Throughout eternity He will bear in His hands the prints of the cruel nails by which
          He was transfixed to the cross of Calvary....</p>
      <p>We are now fitting up for the future, eternal life; and soon, if faithful, we shall see the gates of the city
          of our God swing back on their glittering hinges that the nations who have kept the truth may enter in to
          their eternal</p>
