    <h1>Learning of God Through His Works, January 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise
          thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.145.9"><span
          class="ft6">Psalm 145:9, 10</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>We love to contemplate the character and love of God in His created works. What evidences has He given the
          children of men of His power, as well as of His parental love! He has garnished the heavens and made grand and
          beautiful the earth.</p>
      <p>“O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! ... When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy
          fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the
          son of man, that thou visitest him?” “All thy works praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.8.1"><span class="ft30">Psalm 8:1, 3, 4</span></a>; <a

      <p>Had our world been formed with a perfectly level surface the monotony would have fatigued the eye and wearied
          the senses. God has adorned our world with grand mountains, hills, valleys, and ranges of mountains. The
          rugged granite, bare mountains, also the mountains decorated with evergreens and verdure, and the valleys with
          their softened beauty make the world a mirror of loveliness. The goodness, wisdom, and power of God are
          manifest everywhere. In mountains, rocks, hills, and valleys, I see the works of divine power. I can never be
          lonely while viewing the grand scenery of nature. On the journey over the plains and mountains I have had
          feelings of the deepest reverence and awe while viewing the frowning precipice and <nobr>snow-capped</nobr>
          mountain heights.</p>
      <p>The mountains, hills, and valleys should be to us as schools in which to study the character of God in His
          created works. The works of God which we may view in the <nobr>ever-varying</nobr><nobr>scenes—in</nobr>
          mountains, hills, and valleys, in trees, shrubs, and flowers, in every leaf, every spire of
          <nobr>grass—should</nobr> teach us lessons of the skill and love of God and of His infinite power.</p>
      <p>Those who study nature cannot be lonesome. They love the quiet hours of meditation, for they feel that they are
          brought in close communion with</p>
