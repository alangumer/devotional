    <h1>A Relationship of Interdependence, October 7</h1>

      <p><strong>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the
          members rejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.12.26"><span class="ft6">1 Corinthians 12:26,
          27</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>In the Lord’s plan human beings have been made necessary to one another. To every one God has entrusted
          talents, to be used in helping others to walk in the path of right. It is by unselfish service for others that
          we improve and increase our talents.</p>
      <p>Like the different parts of a machine, all are closely related to one another, and all dependent upon one great
          Center. There is to be unity in diversity. No member of the Lord’s firm can work successfully in independence.
          Each is to work under the supervision of God; all are to use their entrusted capabilities in His service, that
          each may minister to the perfection of the whole....</p>
      <p>He who claims to be a Christian should examine himself and see if he is as kind and considerate of his fellow
          beings as he desires his fellow beings to be of him.... Christ taught that rank or wealth should make no</p>
      <p>difference in our treatment of one another and that in the light of heaven all are brethren. Earthly
          possessions or worldly honor do not count in God’s valuation of man. He created all men equal; He is no
          respecter of persons. He values a man according to the virtue of his character.</p>
      <p>To possess true godliness means to love one another, to help one another, to make apparent the religion of
          Jesus in our lives. We are to be consecrated channels through which the love of Christ flows to those who need
          help.... He who approaches nearest to obedience to the divine law</p>
      <p>will be of the most service to God. He who follows Christ, reaching out after His goodness, His compassion, His
          love for the human family, will be accepted by God as a worker together with Him....</p>
      <p>When the Lord’s people are filled with meekness and tenderness for one another, they will realize that His
          banner over them is love and His fruit will be sweet to their taste. Heaven will begin on earth. They
          will</p>
