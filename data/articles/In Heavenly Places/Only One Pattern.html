    <h1>Only One Pattern, February 17</h1>

      <p><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
          image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.3.18"><span class="ft6">2 Corinthians
          3:18</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>If we gaze even a moment upon the sun in its meridian glory, when we turn away our eyes, the image of the sun
          will appear in everything upon which we look. Thus it is when we behold Jesus; everything we look upon
          reflects His image, the Sun of Righteousness. We cannot see anything else, or talk of anything else. His image
          is imprinted upon the eye of the soul, and affects every portion of our daily life, softening and subduing our
          whole nature. By beholding, we are conformed to the divine similitude, even the likeness of Christ. To all
          with whom we associate we reflect the bright and cheerful beams of His righteousness.</p>
      <p>Jesus was a perfect pattern of what we should be. He was the strictest observer of His Fatherâ€™s law, yet He
          moved in perfect freedom. He had all the fervor of the enthusiast, yet He was calm, sober, and
          <nobr>self-possessed.</nobr> He was elevated above the common affairs of the world, yet He did not exclude
          Himself from society. He dined with publicans and sinners, played with little children, and took them in His
          arms and blessed them. He graced the wedding feast with His presence. He shed tears at the grave of Lazarus.
          He was a lover of the beautiful in nature and used the lilies to illustrate the value of natural simplicity in
          the sight of God, above artificial display. He used the occupation of the husbandman to illustrate the most
          sublime truths....</p>
      <p>His zeal never degenerated into passion nor His consistency into selfish obstinacy. His benevolence never
          savored of weakness nor His sympathy of sentimentalism. He combined the innocence and simplicity of the child
          with manly strength, <nobr>all-absorbing</nobr> devotion to God with tender love for man. He possessed
          commanding dignity combined with winning grace of humility. He manifested unyielding firmness with gentleness.
          May we live daily in close connection with this perfect, faultless character.</p>
      <p>We have not six patterns to follow, nor five; we have only one, and</p>
