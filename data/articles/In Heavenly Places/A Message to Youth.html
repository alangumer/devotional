    <h1>A Message to Youth, July 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye
          have overcome the wicked one.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.2.14">1 John 2:14</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>The children and youth, with their fresh talent, energy, and courage, their quick susceptibilities, are loved
          of God, and He desires to bring them into harmony with divine agencies....</p>
      <p>Our children stand, as it were, at the parting of the ways. On every hand the world’s enticements to
          <nobr>self-seeking</nobr> and <nobr>self-indulgence</nobr> call them away from the path cast up for the
          ransomed of the Lord. Whether their lives shall be a blessing or a curse depends upon the choice they
          make....</p>
      <p>They belong to Christ. They are the purchase of His blood, the claim of His love. They live because He keeps
          them by His power. Their time, their strength, their capabilities, are His, to be developed, to be trained, to
          be used for Him....</p>
      <p>Young men and young women, gather a stock of knowledge.... Keep</p>
      <p>reaching higher and still higher. It is the ability to put to the tax the powers of mind and body, ever keeping
          eternal realities in view, that is of value now. Seek the Lord most earnestly, that you may become more and
          more refined, more spiritually cultured. Then you will have the very best diploma that any one can
          <nobr>have—the</nobr> endorsement of God.</p>
      <p>However large, however small, your talents, remember that what you have is yours only in trust. Thus God is
          testing you, giving you opportunity to prove yourself true.... To Him belong your powers of body, mind,
          and</p>
      <p>soul, and for Him these powers are to be used. Your time, your influence, your capabilities, your
          <nobr>skill—all</nobr> must be accounted for to Him who gives all....</p>
      <p>With such an army of workers as our youth rightly trained might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified,
          risen, and <nobr>soon-coming</nobr> Saviour might be carried to the whole world! How soon might the end
          <nobr>come—the</nobr> end of suffering and sorrow and sin! How soon, in place of a possession here, with its
          blight of sin and pain, our children might receive their inheritance where “the righteous shall inherit the
          land, and dwell</p>
