      <p>In order for our character building to be pleasing to God, we must constantly advance in spirituality. We must
          regard as worthless anything that lessens faith and confidence in our Redeemer. The more light there is
          shining into our souls, the greater the demand upon us to reflect that light to others. God desires you to let
          your light shine forth to the world. He will be glorified in our individual reflection of His
          character....</p>
      <p>Resting in the love of Christ, trusting the Redeemer and <nobr>Life-giver</nobr> to work out for you the
          salvation of your soul, you will know, as you draw nearer and still nearer to Him, what it means to endure the
          seeing of Him who is invisible. God desires us to rest content in His love. The contentment that Christ
          bestows is a gift worth infinitely more than gold and silver and precious stones....</p>
      <p>Your perceptive faculties will increase in power and soundness if your whole being, body, soul, and spirit, is
          consecrated to the accomplishment of a holy work. Make every effort in and through the grace of Christ to
          attain to the high standard set before you. You can be perfect in your sphere as God is perfect in His sphere.
          Has not Christ declared, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect”?</p>
      <p>You are not to regard yourself as merely a passive recipient of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. God has
          entrusted to you precious talents, and He requires the improvement of these talents. Interest from the
          principal lent is His due.... Submitting your will to His will, you will improve in</p>
      <p>speech and in spiritual conceptions....</p>
      <p>You are carefully to guard the powers of the mind. Your thoughts are to be kept under the control of the Holy
          Spirit.... It is your work to</p>
      <p>advance toward perfection, making constant improvement, until at last you are pronounced worthy to receive
          immortal life. And even then the</p>
      <p>work of progression will not cease, but will continue throughout eternity. <span class="ft45">[187]</span></p>
