    <h1>Heart Work, May 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden</strong></p>
      <p>part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.51.6"><span
          class="ft9">Psalm 51:6</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Truth must become truth to the receiver, to all intents and purposes. It must be stamped on the heart. “With
          the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.10.10"><span class="ft30">Romans 10:10</span></a>). “Thou
          shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
          strength” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Mark.12.30"><span class="ft30">Mark 12:30</span></a>).
          This is the service that God accepts.... The heart is the</p>
      <p>citadel of the being, and until that is wholly on the Lord’s side the enemy will gain constant victories over
          us through his subtle temptations....</p>
      <p>Full and abundant is the provision that has been made that we may have mercy, grace, and peace. Why, then, do
          human beings act as if they entertained the idea that the truth is a yoke of bondage? It is because the heart
          has never tasted and seen that the Lord is good.</p>
      <p>The world is full of false teaching; and if we do not resolutely search the Scriptures for ourselves, we shall
          accept the world’s errors for truth, adopt its customs, and deceive our own hearts. Its doctrines and customs
          are at variance with the truth of God....</p>
      <p>It is a matter of the highest importance and interest to us that we understand what truth is, and our petitions
          should go forth with intense earnestness that we may be guided into all truth.</p>
      <p>Truth is sacred, divine. It is stronger and more powerful than anything else in the formation of a character
          after the likeness of Christ. In it there is fullness of joy. When it is cherished in the heart the love of
          Christ is preferred to the love of any human being. This is Christianity. This is the love of God in the soul.
          Thus pure, unadulterated truth occupies the citadel of the being....</p>
      <p>When the truth as it is in Jesus molds our characters it will be seen to be truth indeed. As it is contemplated
          by the believer it will grow brighter, shining with its original beauty. It will increase in value, quickening
          and vivifying the mind and subduing selfish, unChristlike coarseness of character. It will elevate our
          aspirations, enabling us to reach the perfect</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[141]</span><span class="ft27">standard of holiness.</span></p>
