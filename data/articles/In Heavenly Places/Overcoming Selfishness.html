    <h1>Overcoming Selfishness, August 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they
          may be saved. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.10.33"><span class="ft6">1
          Corinthians 10:33</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>There exists in the hearts of many an element of selfishness which clings to them like the leprosy. They have
          so long consulted their own wishes, their own pleasure and convenience, that they do not feel that others have
          claims upon them. Their thoughts, plans, and efforts are for themselves. They live for self, and do not
          cultivate disinterested benevolence, which if exercised, would increase and strengthen until it would be their
          delight to live for others’ good. This selfishness must be seen and overcome, for it is a grievous sin in the
          sight of God. They need to exercise a more special interest for humanity; and in thus doing, they would bring
          their souls into closer connection with Christ, and would be imbued with His Spirit, so that they would cleave
          to Him with so firm a tenacity that nothing could separate them from His love.</p>
      <p>The man whose experience is least to be envied is the one who shuts up his sympathies within his own heart.
          Those who get the most good out of life, who feel the truest satisfaction, are those who receive to give.
          Those who live for self are always in want, for they are never satisfied. There is no Christianity in shutting
          our sympathies up in our own selfish hearts. We are to bring brightness and blessing into the lives of others.
          The Lord has chosen us as channels through which to communicate His blessings.</p>
      <p>The time is coming when the earth shall reel to and fro and shall be removed like a cottage. But the thoughts,
          the purposes, the acts of God’s workers, although now unseen, will appear at the great day of final
          retribution and reward. Things now forgotten will then appear as witnesses, either to approve or to
          condemn.</p>
      <p>Love, courtesy, <nobr>self-sacrifice—these</nobr> are never lost. When God’s chosen ones are changed from
          mortality to immortality, their words and deeds of goodness will be made manifest, and will be preserved
          through the eternal ages. No act of unselfish service, however small or simple, is ever lost. Through the
          merits of Christ’s imputed righteousness, the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[233]</span><span class="ft27">fragrance of such words and deeds is forever
          preserved.</span></p>
