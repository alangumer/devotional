    <h1>The Precious Attribute of Meekness, August 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.5.5"><span class="ft9">Matthew 5:5</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Meekness is a precious, Christian attribute. The meekness and low- liness of Christ are only learned by wearing
          Christ’s yoke.... That yoke</p>
      <p>signifies entire submission.</p>
      <p>The heavenly universe looks upon an absence of meekness and low- liness of heart. The
          <nobr>self-exaltation,</nobr> the feeling of swelling importance, makes the human agent so large in his own
          estimation that he feels that he has no need of a Saviour, no need to wear Christ’s yoke. But the invitation
          to each soul is, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find
          rest unto your souls” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.11.29"><span class="ft10">Matthew
          11:29</span></a>).</p>
      <p>The power of God awaits our demand upon it.... Pure spiritual power</p>
      <p>is fresh every morning and new every evening. It lifts men above worldly ambition and expels all selfishness
          from the soul....</p>
      <p>Selfishness and covetousness have spoiled many lives.... Those who</p>
      <p>behold Jesus lose sight of self. By the eye of faith they behold Him who is invisible. They see the King in His
          beauty and the land that is very far off. They practice economy, and reveal justice and righteousness,
          mortifying self in the place of exalting self....</p>
      <p>The submission which Christ demands, the <nobr>self-surrender</nobr> of the will which admits truth in its
          sanctifying power, which trembles at the word of the Lord, are brought about by the work of the Holy Spirit.
          There must be a transformation of the entire being, heart, soul, and character.... Only at</p>
      <p>the altar of sacrifice, and from the hand of God, can the selfish, grasping man receive the celestial torch
          which reveals his own incompetence and leads him to submit to Christ’s yoke, to learn His meekness and
          lowliness.</p>
      <p>As learners we need to meet with God at the appointed place. Then Christ puts us under the guidance of the
          Spirit, who leads us into all truth, placing our <nobr>self-importance</nobr> in submission to Christ. He
          takes the things of Christ as they fall from His lips and conveys them with living power to the obedient soul.
          Thus we may take a perfect impress of the Author of</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[237]</span><span class="ft27">truth.</span></p>
