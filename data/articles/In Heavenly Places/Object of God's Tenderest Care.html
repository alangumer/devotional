      <p><strong>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also
          are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.2.21"><span class="ft6">Ephesians 2:21,
          22</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The living church of God is individually a habitation of God through the Spirit, that man may become a
          <nobr>well-built</nobr> temple for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God, that the Lord Jesus Christ may
          dwell in his innermost being, ennobling and sanctifying his human nature by His divine attributes.</p>
      <p>The church of Christ is to be in the world but not of the world. In calling His people together in church
          capacity, God designs that they shall form one Christian family and daily be fitting for membership in the
          family above.</p>
      <p>God thus forms the believers in His Word in one body, that their influence may be a blessing to one another and
          to the world. Each member converted reveals a transformation of character, and he is strengthened and
          sustained by the courage and faith of the whole. The weakest saint, if he believes in Christ, is a member of
          Christ’s body; and if he lives in humble dependence upon God, he will become strong; for he has a right to all
          the privileges of a child of God.</p>
      <p>The church is the object of God’s tenderest love and care. If the members will allow Him, He will reveal His
          character through them. He says to them, “Ye are the light of the world.” Those who walk and talk with God
          practice the gentleness of Christ. In their lives, forbearance, meekness, and <nobr>self-restraint</nobr> are
          united with holy earnestness and diligence. As they advance heavenward, the sharp, rough edges of character
          are worn off, and godliness is seen. The Holy Spirit, full of grace and power, works upon mind and heart.</p>
      <p>Christ has made provision that His church shall be a transformed body illumined with the light of heaven,
          possessing the glory of Immanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual
          atmosphere of light and peace.</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy
          Spirit upon the heart and lives a</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[284]</span><span class="ft27">life wholly consecrated to God.</span></p>
