    <h1>Safeguarding the Moral Powers, July 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against
          the soul. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.2.11"><span class="ft30">1 Peter
          2:11</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>There is an alarming commonness in conversation at the present day, which shows a low state of thoughts and
          morals. True dignity of character is very rare. True modesty and reserve are seldom seen. There are but few
          who are pure and undefiled.... God looks upon these things with</p>
      <p>displeasure....</p>
      <p>Polluted thoughts harbored become habit, and the soul is scarred and defiled. Once do a wrong action and a blot
          is made which nothing can heal but the blood of Christ; and if the habit is not turned from with firm
          determination, the soul is corrupted and the streams flowing from this defiling fountain corrupt others.</p>
      <p>There are men and women who invite temptation; they place them- selves in positions where they will be tempted,
          where they cannot but be tempted, when they place themselves in society that is objectionable. The best way to
          keep safe from sin is to move with due consideration at all times and under all circumstances, never to move
          or act from impulse. Move with the fear of God ever before you and you will be sure to act right; then leave
          your reputation with God. Slander cannot then sully your character one particle. No one can degrade our
          character but ourselves, by our own course of action....</p>
      <p>The mind must be kept meditating upon pure and holy subjects. An im- pure suggestion must be dismissed at once,
          and pure, elevating thoughts, holy contemplation, be entertained, thus obtaining more and more knowl- edge of
          God, by training the mind in the contemplation of heavenly things. God has simple means open to every
          individual case, sufficient to secure the great end, the salvation of the soul.</p>
      <p>Resolve to reach a high and holy standard; make your mark high; act with earnest purpose, as did Daniel,
          steadily, perseveringly, and nothing that the enemy can do will hinder your improvement. Notwithstanding
          inconveniences, changes, perplexities, you may constantly advance in</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[198]</span><span class="ft27">mental vigor and moral power.</span></p>
