    <h1>Fragrant in Word, June 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the
          day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
          condemned.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.12.36">Matthew 12:36, 37</a><span
          class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>As the prophet Isaiah beheld the glory of the Lord, he was amazed, and overwhelmed with a sense of his own
          weakness and unworthiness, he cried, “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I
          dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.6.5"><span class="ft39">Isaiah 6:5</span></a>).... Let every
          soul who claims</p>
      <p>to be a son or a daughter of God examine himself in the light of Heaven; let him consider the polluted lips
          that make him “undone.” They are the medium of communication.... Then let them not be used in bringing
          from</p>
      <p>the treasure of the heart words that will dishonor God and discourage those around you, but use them for the
          praise and glory of God, who has formed them for this purpose.... When the love of Jesus is the theme of</p>
      <p>contemplation, the words coming from human lips will be full of praise and thanksgiving to God and to the
          Lamb.</p>
      <p>How many words are spoken in lightness and foolishness, in jesting and joking! This would not be so did the
          followers of Christ realize the truth of the words, “Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
          account thereof in the day of judgment.” ...</p>
      <p>The vision given to Isaiah represents the condition of God’s people in the last days.... As they look by faith
          into the holy of holies, and see</p>
      <p>the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, they perceive that they are a people of unclean
          <nobr>lips—a</nobr> people whose lips have often spoken vanity and whose talents have not been sanctified and
          employed to the glory of God.... If they will humble their souls before God, there is hope for them.</p>
      <p>The bow of promise is above the throne, and the work done for Isaiah will be performed in them.</p>
      <p>Be fragrant in your words. Remember that you are either a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Let
          us be as fragrant flowers. Let the love of Christ pervade your lives. Let your words be such that they
          will</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[178]</span><span class="ft27">be as apples of gold in pictures of silver.</span></p>
