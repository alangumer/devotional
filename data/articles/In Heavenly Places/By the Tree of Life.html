    <h1>By the Tree of Life, December 28</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for
          thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and
          nation. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.5.9"><span class="ft6">Revelation
          5:9</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Do we expect to get to heaven at last and join the heavenly choir? Just as we go into the grave we will come
          up, as far as the character is concerned.... Now is the time for washing and ironing....</p>
      <p>John saw the throne of God and around that throne a company, and he inquired, Who are these? The answer came,
          “These are they which ...</p>
      <p>have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.7.14"><span class="ft17">Revelation 7:14</span></a>).
          Christ leads them to the fountains of living waters, and there is the tree of life and there is the precious
          Saviour. Here is presented to us a life that measures with the life of God. There is no pain, sorrow,
          sickness, or death there. All is peace and harmony and love....</p>
      <p>Now is the time to receive grace and strength and power to combine with our human efforts that we can form
          characters for everlasting life. When we do this we will find that the angels of God will minister unto us,
          and we shall be heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. And when the last trump shall sound, and the
          dead shall be called from their prison house and changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the crowns
          of immortal glory shall be placed upon the heads of the overcomers. The pearly gates will swing back for the
          nations that have kept the truth and they will enter in. The conflict is ended.</p>
      <p>“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.25.34"><span class="ft17">Matthew 25:34</span></a>). Do we
          want this benediction? I do, and I believe you do. May God help you that you may fight the battles of this
          life and gain a victory day by day and at last be among the number that shall cast their crowns at Jesus’ feet
          and touch the golden harps and fill all heaven with sweetest music. I want you to love my Jesus.... Do not
          reject my Saviour, for He has paid an infinite price for</p>
      <p>you. I see in Jesus matchless charms, and I want you to see these charms. <span class="ft59">[370]</span></p>
