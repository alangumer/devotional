    <h1>Under Which Standard? February 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold
          to the one, and despise the other.</strong></p>
      <p>Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.6.24"><span
          class="ft9">Matthew 6:24</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Every individual in our world will be arrayed under one of two ban- <nobr>ners—the</nobr> chosen and loyal
          under the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Prince Immanuel, and all others under Satan’s standard....</p>
      <p>There is to be no compromise with the powers of darkness. Individ- ually we must take our stand. If we are not
          at enmity with the prince of darkness, the serpent, his folds encircle us and all our powers; his sting is in
          our hearts. All who range themselves under the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of the Prince of Life will
          henceforth count Satan as a foe, and will in God’s strength oppose him as a deadly enemy. They will take the
          helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. And what will they do in order to
          hold vantage ground? “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto
          with all perseverance” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.6.18"><span
          class="ft21">Ephesians 6:18</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>We should be quick to discern danger. We should see the hateful character of sin and should expel it from the
          soul. The doers of the Word know that in Jesus there is strength, which becomes their own by faith. They are
          clothed with righteousness that God will accept, for it is the righteousness of Christ. Clad in this armor of
          God, the panoply of heaven, they successfully resist the serpent’s wiles. Not one soul has a moment to
          lose.... The concerns of eternity are of sufficient importance to take</p>
      <p>precedence over every other enterprise. “What must I do to be saved?” should be the great and solemn question
          with us now.</p>
      <p>I wish that all could appreciate the wonderful working of God in behalf of man. For fallen angels there has
          been no atonement; but for fallen man a full and ample offering has been made, to save to the uttermost all
          who shall come unto God by Him.</p>
      <p>God beholds in all His children the image of His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son. He looks upon them with a love
          greater than any language can express. He enfolds them in the arms of His love. The Lord rejoices over
          His</p>
