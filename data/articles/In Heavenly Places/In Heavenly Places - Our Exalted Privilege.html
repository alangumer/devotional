      <p><strong>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in
          sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
          heavenly places in Christ Jesus. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.2.4"><span
          class="ft6">Ephesians</span></a><nobr><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.2.4"><span
          class="ft6">2:4-6</span></a>.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>As God raised Christ from the dead, that He might bring life and immortality to light through the gospel, and
          thus save His people from their sins, so Christ has raised fallen human beings to spiritual life, quickening
          them with His life, filling their hearts with hope and joy.</p>
      <p>Christ gave Himself for the redemption of the race, that all who believe in Him may have everlasting life.
          Those who appreciate this great sacrifice receive from the Saviour that most precious of all
          <nobr>gifts—a</nobr> clean heart. They gain an experience that is more valuable than gold or silver or
          precious stones. They sit together in heavenly places in Christ, enjoying in communion with Him the joy and
          peace that He alone can give. They love Him with heart and mind and soul and strength, realizing that they are
          His <nobr>blood-bought</nobr> heritage. Their spiritual eyesight is not dimmed by worldly policy or worldly
          aims. They are one with Christ as He is one with the Father.</p>
      <p>Christ “gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
          people, zealous of good works” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Titus.2.14"><span
          class="ft10">Titus 2:14</span></a>). He made an offering so complete that through His grace every one may
          reach the standard of perfection. Of those who receive His grace and follow His example it will be written in
          the book of life, “Complete in <nobr>Him—without</nobr> spot or stain.”</p>
      <p>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,” ... “who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
          in heavenly places in Christ” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.1.3"><span
          class="ft21">Ephesians 1:3</span></a>). What is there left for us to ask, that is not included in this
          merciful, abundant provision? Through the merits of Christ we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in
          heavenly places in Christ. It is our privilege to draw nigh to God, to breathe in the atmosphere of His
          presence.... Nothing short of abiding in the presence of Christ will bring</p>
