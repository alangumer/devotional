    <h1>Pressing Against the Current, September 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at
          the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.13.23"><span class="ft6">Luke 13:23,
          24</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>When we read that many will seek to enter in and shall not be able, then we want to understand what we shall do
          in order to succeed. This to us is a mournful statement, that there are those who will fail to enter in at the
          strait gate because they only seek to enter in, and do not strive....</p>
      <p>We are in a world where sin and iniquity prevail, and we want to know what we shall do in order to inherit
          life. We cannot any of us afford to miss the great reward that is presented before the overcomer. We want to
          know that the steps that we are taking are heavenward instead of earthward....</p>
      <p>A great and solemn responsibility rests upon us who profess to obey God’s commandments, to show to the world
          around us that we are bending our steps heavenward. And as we press against the current that is bearing all
          down, then we should know for what we should strive. We are to press toward the mark of the prize of our high
          calling in Christ Jesus. We cannot remain in listless resistance and yet gain the prize....</p>
      <p>We are to grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus, and we are thus growing up a precious
          temple unto the Lord. He says, “I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they
          shall be my people” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Corinthians.6.16"><span class="ft30">2
          Corinthians 6:16</span></a>).... What we want is the</p>
      <p>Spirit of God in our souls. We want our faces set constantly heavenward. And when we see that sin in us is
          striving for the mastery, then we must strive....</p>
      <p>The pitying Saviour stands right by your side to help you. He would send every angel out of glory while you are
          struggling to overcome sin, so that Satan cannot have the victory over you. Christ ... took man’s human nature
          upon Him that He might come right down to man in the temptation wherewith man is beset. The pitiful Redeemer
          knows just how to help us</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[264]</span><span class="ft27">in every one of our strivings.</span></p>
