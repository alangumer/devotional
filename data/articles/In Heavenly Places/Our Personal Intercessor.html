    <h1>Our Personal Intercessor, March 13</h1>

      <p><strong>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the
          right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. <a

      <p>The Lord Jesus is your personal intercessor.... Repeat over and over</p>
      <p>many times through the day, “Jesus has died for me. He saw me in peril, exposed to destruction, and poured out
          His life to save me. He does not behold the soul as a trembling suppliant prostrate at His feet without pity,
          and He will not fail to raise me up.” He has become the advocate for man. He has lifted up those who believe
          in Him and placed a treasurehouse of blessing at their demand. Men cannot bestow one blessing upon their
          fellows, they cannot remove one stain of sin. It is only the merit and righteousness of Christ that will avail
          anything, but this is placed to our account in rich fullness. We may draw upon God every moment. As we turn to
          Him, He answers, “Here I am.”</p>
      <p>Christ proclaims Himself our Intercessor. He would have us know that He has graciously engaged to be our
          Substitute. He places His merit in the golden censer to offer up with the prayers of His saints, so that the
          prayers of His dear children may be mingled with the fragrant merit of Christ as they ascend to the Father in
          the cloud of incense.</p>
      <p>The Father hears every prayer of His contrite children. The voice of supplication from the earth unites with
          the voice of our Intercessor, who pleads in heaven, whose voice the Father always hears. Let our prayers
          therefore continually ascend to God. Let them not come up in the name of any human being, but in the name of
          Him who is our Substitute and Surety. Christ has given us His name to use....</p>
      <p>Jesus receives and welcomes you as His own friend. He loves you; He has pledged Himself to open before you all
          the treasures of His grace for your appropriation. He says, “At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say
          not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved
          me, and have believed that I came out from God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.16.26"><span class="ft21">John 16:26, 27</span></a>). He
          virtually says, Make use of My name, and it will be your passport to the heart of My Father, and to all
          the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[80]</span><span class="ft27">riches of His grace.</span></p>
