    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him
          endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.12.2"><span class="ft6">Hebrews
          12:2</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The cross speaks life, and not death, to the soul that believes in Jesus. Welcome the precious
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> rays that shine from the cross of Calvary. Reach up for the blessing, believe for the
          blessing....</p>
      <p>Walk not in the shadow of the cross. Do not give expression to weeping, lamentation, and woe; but encourage
          your soul to hope and joy. The cross points upward to a living Saviour, who is your advocate, and is pleading
          in your behalf.... When you are deeply shadowed it is because</p>
      <p>Satan has interposed himself between you and the bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness....</p>
      <p>I have indeed been halting under the shadow of the cross. It is not a common thing for me to be overpowered and
          to suffer so much depression of spirits as I have suffered for the last few months. I would not be found to
          trifle with my own soul and thus trifle with my Saviour. I would not teach that Jesus is risen from the tomb,
          and that He is ascended on high and lives to make intercession for us before the Father, unless I carry out my
          teachings by practice and believe in Him for His salvation, casting my helpless soul upon Jesus for His grace,
          for righteousness, for peace and love.</p>
      <p>I must trust in Him irrespective of the changes of my emotional atmo- sphere. I must show forth the praises of
          Him who has called me out of darkness into His marvelous light. My heart must be steadfast in Christ, my
          Saviour, beholding His love and gracious goodness. I must not trust Him now and then, but always, that I may
          manifest the results of abiding in Him who has bought me with His precious blood. We must learn to believe the
          promises, to have an abiding faith....</p>
      <p>Let us live in the sunlight of the cross of Calvary. Let us no longer dwell in the shadow, complaining of our
          sorrows, for this only deepens our trouble. Let us never forget, even when we walk in the valley, that Christ
          is as much with us when we walk trustingly there as when we are</p>
