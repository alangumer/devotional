    <h1>Using Our Talents for God, August 5</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and
          delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every
          man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.25.14"><span class="ft6">Matthew 25:14,
          15</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The parable of the Talents... has a personal and individual application to every man, woman, and child
          possessed of the powers of reason....</p>
      <p>When the master of the house called his servants he gave to every man his work. The whole family of God are
          included in the responsibility of using their Lordâ€™s goods. Every individual, from the lowliest and most
          obscure to the greatest and most exalted, is a moral agent endowed with abilities for which he is accountable
          to God.... The spiritual, mental, and physical</p>
      <p>ability, the influence, station, possessions, affections, sympathies, all are precious talents to be used in
          the cause of the Master for the salvation of souls for whom Christ died.</p>
      <p>How few appreciate these blessings! How few seek to improve their talent and increase their usefulness in the
          world! The Master has given to every man his work. He has given to every man according to his ability, and his
          trust is in proportion to his capacity.... Let the businessman do his</p>
      <p>business in a way that will glorify his Master because of his fidelity. Let him carry his religion into
          everything that is done and reveal to men the spirit of Christ. Let the mechanic be a diligent and faithful
          representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks of life in the cities of Judea....</p>
      <p>Those who have been blessed with superior talents should not depreci- ate the value of the services of those
          who are less gifted than themselves. The smallest trust is a trust from God. With the blessing of God, the one
          talent through diligent use will be doubled, and the two used in the service of Christ will be increased to
          four; and thus the humblest instrument may grow in power and usefulness.</p>
      <p>The earnest purpose, the <nobr>self-denying</nobr> efforts, are all seen, appreciated, and accepted by the God
          of heaven.... Use your gift in meekness, in</p>
      <p>humility, in trusting faith, and wait till the day of reckoning, and you will</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[225]</span><span class="ft27">have no cause for grief or shame.</span></p>
