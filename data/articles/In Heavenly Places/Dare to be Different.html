    <h1>Dare to be Different, June 9</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
          the Father is not in him. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.2.15"><span class="ft6">1 John
          2:15</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Those who claim to know the truth and understand the great work to be done for this time are to consecrate
          themselves to God, soul, body, and spirit. In heart, in dress, in language, in every respect, they are to be
          separate from the fashions and practices of the world. They are to be a peculiar and holy people. It is not
          their dress that makes them peculiar; but because they are a peculiar and holy people, they cannot carry the
          marks of likeness to the world.</p>
      <p>As a people we are to prepare the way of the Lord. Every iota of ability God has given us must be put to use in
          preparing the people after God’s fashion, after His spiritual mold, to stand in this great day of God’s
          preparation.... Many who suppose they are going to heaven are blindfolded</p>
      <p>by the world. Their ideas of what constitutes a religious education and religious discipline are vague, resting
          only upon possibilities. There are many who have no intelligent hope, and are running great risk in practicing
          the very things which Jesus has taught that they should not do, in eating, drinking, and dressing, binding
          themselves up with the world in a variety of ways. They have yet to learn the serious lesson so essential to
          growth in spirituality, to come out from the world and be separate.</p>
      <p>The heart is divided, the carnal mind craves conformity, similarity to the world in so many ways, that the mark
          of distinction from the world is scarcely distinguishable. Money, God’s money, is expended in order to make an
          appearance after the world’s customs; the religious experience is contaminated with worldliness, and the
          evidence of <nobr>discipleship—Christ’s</nobr> likeness in <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and cross
          <nobr>bearing—is</nobr> not discernible by the world or by the universe of heaven.</p>
      <p>The question to be settled is, “Are we willing to separate ourselves from the world, that we may become
          children of God?” This is not the work of a moment or of a day.... It is a lifelong work. Love to God
          must</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[168]</span><span class="ft27">be a living principle, underlying every act and word and
          thought.</span></p>
