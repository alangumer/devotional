    <h1>We are God’s Property, August 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people,
          and the sheep of his pasture. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.100.3"><span
          class="ft6">Psalm 100:3</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>God has created man and given him all his faculties of body, soul, and spirit. The Lord Jesus has bought him
          with a price so full, so ample, that there could be no competition. What can man offer to God that is not
          already the Lord’s own? God gave the faculties, and every working of these faculties belongs to God. This
          means that your experience from first to last is to be yoked up with Christ. Learning the lessons of meekness
          and lowliness of heart makes you a partaker of Christ’s sufferings and appreciative of the virtues of the life
          of Christ.</p>
      <p>There will be a constant prayer, Keep me by Thy power; let not my feet slide; let not my heart be filled with
          ambitious plans to exalt myself....</p>
      <p>Teach me how to practice the art of <nobr>self-emptying</nobr> in order to be supplied with the grace of Christ
          and have that love Christ prayed that I might have, “as I have loved you” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.13.34"><span class="ft10">John 13:34</span></a>). I must
          receive grace that I may supply others with that grace. Oh, give my soul much nearness to God, that I may
          receive His disposition and love my brethren. Help me, O Lord, to realize that I am of myself unable to do
          anything in its true, pure bearings. Self, self, will be continually active for recognition, even in the very
          holiest of exercises....</p>
      <p>Our work individually is to copy the character of Christ, who gave His life to make it possible for us to do
          this. Shall we evidence to the world that we are children of God, bought with a price, and that we are bearing
          fruit in speech, in tone of voice, and in kindness of redeeming love, showing what it means to keep the
          commandments of God?....</p>
      <p>The grace given cost Heaven a price it is impossible for us to measure. That grace is our choicest treasure,
          and Christ means that it shall be communicated through us. It is sacred, in the name of Jesus, to the saving
          of the soul. It is the revealing of the honor of God, an unfolding of His glory. And shall any man or woman
          professing godliness misinterpret the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[221]</span><span class="ft27">gift, ignore the Giver, and present a substitute?</span></p>
