    <h1>The Vital Threads of Influence, June 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths</strong></p>
      <p>of the righteous. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.2.20"><span class="ft9">Proverbs
          2:20</span></a>.</p>
      <p>It is generally the case that in school associations there are developed two classes of
          <nobr>persons—those</nobr> who seek to do the right and those who solicit others to enter into evil....</p>
      <p>In associating with the careless and reckless it is an easy matter to come to view things as they do and to
          lose all sense of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. Guard yourself on this one point in particular. Do
          not be influenced and led astray by those you have reason to know by their words and actions are not in
          connection with God. “By their fruits ye shall know them” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.7.20"><span class="ft10">Matthew 7:20</span></a>)....</p>
      <p>Satan is seeking to imbue every soul that is not connected with Jesus Christ with his own spirit, and every
          soul who refuses to connect with Jesus Christ will be brought into connection with the enemy of Christ. There
          are threads of influence leading out from these souls to bind and draw other souls by human influence until
          they shall be placed under the control of Satan, and their feet be led into false paths.... This danger
          is</p>
      <p>common to all. You will be tempted to choose your own way and to have your own will, while disregarding the
          will of God....</p>
      <p>Let nothing draw you away from the work of character building, but do your work for time and for eternity....
          Live a life of consistency, and</p>
      <p>fashion your character after the divine Pattern. If you live carelessly and do not watch unto prayer, you will
          surely fall a prey to the enemy and will yield to enticements to sin; thus you will lay upon the foundation
          stone, wood, hay, and stubble, which will be consumed in the last great day.</p>
      <p>Every heart is moved or drawn of Jesus Christ. As you become stu- dents of Scripture the Spirit of God takes
          the things of God and impresses them upon the soul. The golden threads that extend from the souls of those who
          make God their strength will fasten through the threads of influence to other souls and draw them to Christ.
          This is the work to be done by those who place on the foundation stone precious material, for</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[172]</span><span class="ft27">they cooperate with Jesus Christ.</span></p>
