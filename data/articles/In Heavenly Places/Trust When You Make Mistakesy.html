    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation:
          he is my defence; I shall not be moved. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.62.5"><span
          class="ft6">Psalm 62:5, 6</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>To each one of us has been given the inestimable privilege of being a child of God. Why, then, should we be
          unhappy? We are all sinful, but we have a Saviour who can take away our sins, for in Him is no sin. We all
          have many difficulties to meet, many perplexing problems to solve. But we have an <nobr>all-powerful</nobr>
          Helper, who will listen to our requests as willingly and gladly as He listened to the requests of those who,
          when He was on this earth in person, came to Him for help....</p>
      <p>Do you make mistakes? Do not let this discourage you. The Lord may permit you to make small mistakes in order
          to save you from making larger mistakes. Go to Jesus, and ask Him to forgive you, and then believe that He
          does. “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.John.1.9"><span class="ft40">1 John
          1:9</span></a>).</p>
      <p>When discouragement presses heavily upon you, read the following scriptures: ...</p>
      <p>“Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. Yet
          the Lord will command his lov- ingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my
          prayer unto the God of my life. I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning
          because of the oppression of the enemy? ... Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
          within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God” (<a

      <p>“God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. There- fore will not we fear, though the earth
          be removed, and though the moun- tains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar
          and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.” “For this God is our God for ever and
          ever: he will be our guide even unto</p>
