      <p><strong>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality</strong></p>

          2:10</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>Christ’s likeness in us is a grand truth, a practical truth. I am not merely a thing that God loves, made to be
          left the sport of Satan’s temptations; I am a child of God, begotten unto a lively hope, big with immortality
          and full of glory. We are to dwell in God, and God in us. Purity in us is like purity in God; love in my heart
          is a living principle, like the love in the heart of God; and all the treasures of heaven are at my command
          because I am redeemed by the blood of the Lamb....</p>
      <p>We are sons and daughters of God. Satan is the destroyer and Christ is the restorer. He will make us partakers
          of His holiness. God does not make light of sin, but He seeks to rescue us from sin. There is not in Jesus
          Christ harsh, stern repulsiveness or resentment; and if we have the character of Christ we shall have His
          mold. There is no forcing us to holiness, but</p>
      <p>... He wishes us to imitate His character, to admire <nobr>Him—true,</nobr> pure, generous, and loving....</p>
      <p>Happiness is composed of little things and great things.... If we would</p>
      <p>become like Christ and receive His fashion of character, we must in little things train the soul to daily
          progressive sanctification. We have no time to lose. Would you impress the seal to obtain a clear impression
          upon the wax, you do not dash it on by a violent action, but you place the seal carefully and firmly and press
          it down until the wax receives the mold. Just so the Lord is dealing with our souls.... Not now and then, but
          constantly</p>
      <p>the new life is implanted by the Holy Spirit after Christ’s likeness.</p>
      <p>Acts make habits and habits constitute character. There is no fear of overlooking great things, but there is
          peril in overlooking and undervaluing little things. God is the God of the whole man, and the little things
          are essential. God is a God of the whole man, and not a God of the part. He made all, He redeemed all, and He
          must be served in all, and then He will bless all, soul and body. Our entire life will then be glorified, and
          every</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[67]</span><span class="ft27">breath, every sound, every touch will be peace and light and
          happiness.</span></p>
