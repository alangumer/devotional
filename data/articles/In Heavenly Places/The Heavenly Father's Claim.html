    <h1>The Heavenly Father’s Claim, May 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always,
          that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Deuteronomy.5.29"><span class="ft6">Deuteronomy
          5:29</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>God stands toward His people in the relation of a father, and He has a father’s claim to our faithful service.
          Consider the life of Christ. Standing at the head of humanity, serving His Father, He is an example of what
          every son should and may be. The obedience that Christ rendered, God requires from human beings today. He
          served His Father in love, with willingness and freedom. “I delight to do thy will, O my God,” He declared:
          “yea, thy law is within my heart” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.40.8"><span
          class="ft21">Psalm 40:8</span></a>). Christ counted no sacrifice too great, no toil too hard, in order to
          accomplish the work which He came to do. At the age of twelve He said, “Wist ye not that I must be about my
          Father’s business?” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.2.49"><span class="ft21">Luke
          2:49</span></a>). He had heard the call, and had taken up the work. “My meat,” He said, “is to do the will of
          him that sent me, and to finish his work” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.4.34"><span
          class="ft21">John 4:34</span></a>).</p>
      <p>Thus we are to serve God. He only serves who acts up to the highest standard of obedience. All who would be
          sons and daughters of God must prove themselves <nobr>co-workers</nobr> with Christ and God and the heavenly
          angels. This is the test for every soul....</p>
      <p>God’s great object in the working out of His providences is to try men, to give them opportunity to develop
          character. Thus He proves whether they are obedient or disobedient to His commands. Good works do not purchase
          the love of God, but they reveal that we possess that love. If we surrender the will to God, we shall not work
          in order to earn God’s love. His love as a free gift will be received into the soul, and from love to Him we
          shall delight to obey His commandments.</p>
      <p>There are only two classes in the world today, and only two classes will be recognized in the
          <nobr>judgment—those</nobr> who violate God’s law and those who obey it. Christ gives the test by which we
          prove our loyalty or disloyalty. “If ye love me,” He says, “keep my commandments.... He</p>
      <p>that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me ...”</p>
