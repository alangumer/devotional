    <h1>The Shepherd’s Tender Care, January 19</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
          ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.15.7"><span class="ft6">Luke 15:7</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The beautiful parable that Christ gave of the one lost sheep, of the shepherd that left the ninety and nine to
          go in search of that which was lost, illustrates the care of the great Shepherd. He did not look carelessly
          over the sheep of the fold, and say, “I have ninety and nine, and it will cost me too much trouble to go in
          search of the straying one; let him come back, and I will open the door of the sheepfold and let him in; but I
          cannot go after him.” No.... He counts and recounts the flock, and when he is</p>
      <p>certain that one sheep is lost, he slumbereth not. He leaves the ninety and nine within the fold; however dark
          and tempestuous the night, however perilous and unpleasant the way, however long and tedious the search, he
          does not weary, he does not falter, until the lost is found.</p>
      <p>But when it is found, does he act indifferently? Does he call the sheep, and command the straying one to follow
          him? Does he threaten and beat it, or drive it before him, recounting the bitterness and discomfiture and
          anxiety that he has had on its account? No; he lays the weary, exhausted, wandering sheep on his shoulder, and
          ... returns it to the fold. His gratitude finds expression in melodious songs of rejoicing, and heavenly
          choirs respond to the shepherd’s note of joy.... For “joy shall be in heaven over</p>
      <p>one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.” Jesus says,
          “I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.10.14"><span class="ft39">John 10:14</span></a>). Just as a
          shepherd of earth knows his sheep, so does the chief Shepherd know His flock that are scattered throughout the
          whole world.... “And ye, my flock, the flock</p>
      <p>of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ezekiel.34.31"><span class="ft10">Ezekiel 34:31</span></a>).</p>
      <p>However lowly, however elevated we may be, whether we are in the shadow of adversity or in the sunshine of
          prosperity, we are His sheep,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[26]</span><span class="ft27">the flock of His pasture, and under the care of the chief
          Shepherd.</span></p>
