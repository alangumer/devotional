      <p><strong>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
          hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. <a

      <p>It seems almost too good to believe that the Father can and does love any member of the human family as He
          loves His Son. But we have the assurance that He does, and this assurance should bring joy to every heart,
          awakening the highest reverence and calling forth unspeakable gratitude. God’s love is not uncertain and
          unreal, but a living reality.</p>
      <p>The Creator of all worlds proposes to love those who believe in His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son as their
          personal Saviour, even as He loves His Son. Even here and now His gracious favor is bestowed upon us to this
          mar- velous extent.... Much as He has promised us for the life to come, He also</p>
      <p>bestows princely gifts upon us in this life, and as subjects of His grace, He would have us enjoy everything
          that will ennoble, expand, and elevate our characters. It is His design to fit us for the heavenly courts
          above.</p>
      <p>Those who live in close fellowship with Christ will be promoted by Him to positions of trust. The servant who
          does the best he can for his master is admitted to familiar intercourse with one whose commands he loves to
          obey. In the faithful discharge of duty we may become one with Christ, for those who are obeying God’s
          commands may speak to Him freely. The one who talks most familiarly with his divine Leader has the most
          exalted conception of His greatness and is the most obedient to His commands.</p>
      <p>In the life of man things sacred and secular are to be done, some in business lines, some in the ministry of
          the Word, and some in various trades; but when a man gives himself to Christ and loves God with the whole
          heart, mind, soul, and strength, he serves with a devotion that takes his whole being.... He recognizes the
          ownership of his powers and the</p>
      <p>ownership of himself. This consecration invests his whole life with a sacredness which makes him gentle, kind,
          and courteous. His every act is a consecrated act.... He is under Christ, being trained for the higher
          grade</p>
