    <h1>How to Study the Bible, May 11</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and</strong></p>
      <p>they are they which testify of me. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.5.39"><span

      <p>It is not enough to study the Bible as other books are studied. In order for it to be understood savingly, the
          Holy Spirit must move on the heart of the searcher. The same Spirit that inspired the Word must inspire the
          reader of the Word. Then will be heard the voice of heaven....</p>
      <p>The mere reading of the Word will not accomplish the result designed of heaven; it must be studied and
          cherished in the heart. The knowledge of God is not gained without mental effort. We should diligently study
          the Bible, asking God for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that we may understand His Word. We should take one
          verse and concentrate the mind on the task of ascertaining the thought which God has put in that verse for us.
          We should dwell on the thought till it becomes our own, and we know “what saith the Lord.”</p>
      <p>There is but little benefit derived from a hasty reading of the Scrip- tures. One may read the Bible through
          and yet fail to see its beauty or to comprehend its deep and hidden meaning. One passage studied until its
          significance is clear to the mind and its relation to the plan of salvation is evident, is of more value than
          the perusal of many chapters with no definite purpose in view and no positive instruction gained. Keep your
          Bible with you. As you have opportunity, read it; fix the texts in your memory. Even while you are walking the
          streets you may read a passage and meditate upon it, thus fixing it in mind.</p>
      <p>Times that will try men’s souls are just before us, and those who are weak in the faith will not stand the test
          of those days of peril. The great truths of revelation are to be carefully studied, for we shall all want an
          intelligent knowledge of the word of God. By Bible study and daily communion with Jesus we shall gain clear,
          <nobr>well-defined</nobr> views of individual responsibility and strength to stand in the day of trial and
          temptation. He whose life is united to Christ by hidden links will be kept</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[139]</span><span class="ft27">by the power of God through faith unto salvation.</span></p>
