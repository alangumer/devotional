    <h1>The Prayer Meeting a Precious Season, March 25</h1>

      <p><strong>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall
          ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together
          in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.18.19"><span
          class="ft6">Matthew 18:19, 20</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord has promised that where two or three are met together in His name, there will He be in the midst.
          Those who meet together for prayer will receive an unction from the Holy One. There is great need of secret
          prayer, but there is also need that several Christians meet together and unite with earnestness their
          petitions to God.</p>
      <p>Seek every opportunity to go where prayer is wont to be made. Those who are really seeking for communion with
          God will be seen in the prayer meeting, faithful to do their duty, and earnest and anxious to reap all the
          benefits they can gain. They will improve every opportunity of placing themselves where they can receive the
          rays of light from heaven.</p>
      <p>We meet together to edify one another by an interchange of thoughts and feelings, to gather strength, and
          light, and courage by becoming acquainted with one anotherâ€™s hopes and aspirations; and by our earnest,
          heartfelt prayers, offered up in faith, we receive refreshment and vigor from the Source of our strength.
          These meetings should be most precious seasons....</p>
      <p>All have not the same experience in their religious life. But those of diverse exercises come together and with
          simplicity and humbleness of mind talk out their experience. All who are pursuing the onward Christian course
          should have, and will have, an experience that is living, that is new and interesting. A living experience is
          made up of daily trials, conflicts, and temptations, strong efforts and victories, and great peace and joy
          gained through Jesus. A simple relation of such experiences gives light, strength, and knowledge that will aid
          others in their advancement in the divine life.</p>
      <p>Educate your mind to love the Bible, to love the prayer meeting, to love the hour of meditation, and, above
          all, the hour when the soul communes</p>
