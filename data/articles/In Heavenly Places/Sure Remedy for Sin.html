    <h1>Sure Remedy for Sin, January 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
          white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.1.18"><span class="ft6">Isaiah 1:18</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>That which should cause us the deepest joy is the fact that God forgives sin. If we take Him at His word and
          forsake our sins, He is ready and willing to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. He will give us a pure heart
          and the abiding presence of His Spirit, for Jesus lives to intercede for us. But ... spiritual things are
          spiritually discerned. It is a living, active, abiding faith that discerns the will of God, that appropriates
          the promises, and profits by the truths of His word. It is not because we are righteous, but because we are
          dependent, faulty, erring, and helpless ourselves, that we must rely upon Christ’s righteousness, and not upon
          our own.</p>
      <p>When you receive the words of Christ as if they were addressed to you personally, when each applies the truth
          to himself as if he were the only sinner on the face of the earth for whom Christ died, you will learn to
          claim by faith the merits of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour....</p>
      <p>Many feel that their faults of character make it impossible for them to meet the standard that Christ has
          erected, but all that such ones have to do is to humble themselves at every step under the mighty hand of God.
          Christ does not estimate the man by the amount of work he does, but by the spirit in which the work is
          performed.</p>
      <p>When He sees men lifting the burdens, trying to carry them in lowli- ness of mind, with distrust of self and
          with reliance upon Him, He adds to their work His perfection and sufficiency, and it is accepted of the
          Father. We are accepted in the Beloved. The sinner’s defects are covered by the perfection and fullness of the
          Lord our Righteousness. Those who with sincere will, with contrite heart, are putting forth humble efforts to
          live up to the requirements of God, are looked upon by the Father with pitying, tender love; He regards such
          as obedient children, and the righteousness</p>
