    <h1>Longing for Heaven, December 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for
          the living God. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.84.2"><span class="ft6">Psalm
          84:2</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>When Godâ€™s people take their eyes off the things of this world and place them on heaven and heavenly things
          they will be a peculiar people, because they will see the mercy and goodness and compassion that God has shown
          to the children of men. His love will call forth a response from them, and their lives will show to those
          around them that the Spirit of God is controlling them, that they are setting their affections on things
          above, not on the things of the earth.</p>
      <p>In thinking of heaven, we may put our imagination to the utmost stretch and think the loftiest thoughts that we
          are capable of thinking, and ours mind will grow weary in the effort to comprehend the breadth and depth and
          height of the subject. It is impossible for our minds to take in the great themes of eternity. It is
          impossible for us even to make an effort to understand these things without the effort affecting our whole
          character for good and having an uplifting influence on our minds. As we think of how Christ came to our world
          to die for fallen man, we understand something of the price that was paid for our redemption, and we realize
          that there is no true goodness or greatness apart from God.</p>
      <p>Only by the light shining from the cross of Calvary can we know to what depths of sin and degradation the human
          race has fallen through sin. Only by the length of the chain let down from heaven to draw us up can we know
          the depths to which we had sunk. And it is only by keeping the unseen realities in view that we can understand
          anything of the wonderful theme of redemption.</p>
      <p>We are almost home; we shall soon hear the voice of the Saviour richer than any music, saying, Your warfare is
          accomplished. Enter into the joy of thy Lord. Blessed, blessed benediction; I want to hear it from His
          immortal lips. I want to praise Him; I want to honor Him that sitteth on the throne. I want my voice to echo
          and <nobr>re-echo</nobr> through the courts of heaven. Will you be there? ... God help us, and fill us with
          all fullness</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[369]</span><span class="ft27">and power, and then we can taste of the joys of the world to
          come.</span></p>
