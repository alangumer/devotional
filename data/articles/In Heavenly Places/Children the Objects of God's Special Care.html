    <h1>Children the Objects of God’s Special Care, July 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save</strong></p>
      <p>thy children. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.49.25"><span class="ft9">Isaiah
          49:25</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The vows of David recorded in <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.101.1"><span
          class="ft30">Psalm 101</span></a>should be the vows of all upon whom rest the responsibilities of guarding the
          influences of the home. David declared: “I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.... I</p>
      <p>will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.101.2"><span class="ft10">Psalm 101:2, 3</span></a>).</p>
      <p>The enemy of souls will invent many things to lead the minds of our youth from firm faith in God to the
          idolatrous practices of the world. Let the cautions given to ancient Israel be carefully studied. Satan’s
          efforts to spoil the thoughts and confuse the judgment are unceasing, and we must be on our guard. We must be
          careful to maintain our allegiance to God as His peculiar people....</p>
      <p>We should endeavor to keep out of our homes every influence that is not productive of good. In this matter some
          parents have much to learn. To those who feel free to read story magazines and novels, I say: You are sowing
          seed, the harvest of which you will not care to gather. There is no spiritual strength to be gained from such
          reading. Rather it destroys the love for the pure truth of the Word. Through the agency of novels and story
          magazines Satan is working to fill with unreal and trivial thoughts the minds that should be diligently
          studying the Word of God. Thus he is robbing thousands upon thousands of the time and energy and
          <nobr>self-discipline</nobr> demanded by the stern problems of life.</p>
      <p>Let the youth be taught to give close study to the Word of God. Re- ceived into the soul, it will prove a
          mighty barricade against temptations. “Thy word,” the psalmist declares, “have I hid in mine heart, that I
          might not sin against thee.” “By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.119.11"><span class="ft10">Psalm 119:11</span></a>; <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.17.4"><span class="ft10">17:4</span></a>).</p>
      <p>If the counsels of the Word of God are faithfully followed, the saving grace of Christ will be brought to our
          youth; for the children who are trained to love and obey God, and who yield themselves to the molding</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[216]</span><span class="ft27">power of His Word, are the objects of God’s special care and
          blessing.</span></p>
