    <h1>A Time of Trouble, December 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the
          sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short
          time. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.12.12"><span class="ft6">Revelation
          12:12</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>As we approach the perils of the last days, the temptations of the enemy become stronger and more determined.
          Satan has come down in great power, knowing that his time is short; and he is working “with all deceivableness
          of unrighteousness in them that perish” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Thessalonians.2.10"><span class="ft21">2 Thessalonians
          2:10</span></a>). The warning comes to us through God’s Word that, if it were possible, he would deceive the
          very elect.</p>
      <p>Wonderful events are soon to open before the world. The end of all things is at hand. The time of trouble is
          about to come upon the people of God. Then it is that the decree will go forth forbidding those who keep the
          Sabbath of the Lord to buy or sell, and threatening them with punishment, and even death, if they do not
          observe the first day of the week as the Sabbath.</p>
      <p>“And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and
          there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at
          that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Daniel.12.1"><span class="ft21">Daniel 12:1</span></a>). By this we
          see the importance of having our names written in the book of life. All whose names are registered there will
          be delivered from Satan’s power, and Christ will command that their filthy garments be removed, and that they
          be clothed with His righteousness. “And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make
          up my jewels ...” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Malachi.3.17"><span class="ft21">Malachi
          3:17</span></a>).</p>
      <p>In the time of trouble Satan stirs up the wicked, and they encircle the people of God to destroy them. But he
          does not know that “pardon” has been written opposite their names in the books of heaven. He does not know
          that the command has been given, “Take away the filthy garments” from them, clothe them with “change of
          raiment,” and set “a fair miter” upon their heads (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Zechariah.3.4"><span class="ft10">Zechariah 3:4,
          5</span></a>)....</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[345]</span><span class="ft50">How precious in the sight of God are His people!</span></p>
