    <h1>God’s Plan for Support of His Work, October 23</h1>

      <p><strong>The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be</strong></p>
      <p>watered also himself. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.11.25"><span class="ft9">Proverbs
          11:25</span></a>.</p>
      <p>The Lord has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent on the consecrated ability and the voluntary gifts
          and offerings of His people. While He has called men to preach the Word, He has made it the privilege of the
          whole church to share in the work by contributing of their means to its support. And He has bidden them also
          to care for the poor, as representatives of Himself. A tithe of all our income the Lord claims as His own, to
          be devoted solely to the support of those who give themselves to the preaching of the gospel. And besides this
          He asks of us gifts and offerings for His cause and also to supply the needs of the poor....</p>
      <p>The Lord is ever bestowing His blessings and mercies upon men. Should He withdraw these gifts we should perish.
          Every moment He has His human family in view. “He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
          sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.5.45"><span
          class="ft21">Matthew 5:45</span></a>). He gives us “fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
          gladness” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Acts.14.17"><span class="ft21">Acts 14:17</span></a>).
          It is God who gives men power to get wealth. The quick, sharp thought, the ability to plan and execute, are
          from Him. It is He who blesses us with health and opens ways for us to acquire means by diligent use of our
          powers. And he says to us, “A portion of the money I have enabled you to gain is Mine. Put it into the
          treasury in tithes, in gifts and offerings, that there may be meat in Mine <nobr>house—that</nobr> there may
          be something to sustain those who carry the gospel of My grace to the world.”</p>
      <p>God might have carried forward His work in the world, and have provided for the poor, without the cooperation
          of man. He asks for our service and our gifts, not only that we may thus manifest our love for Him and our
          fellow men but because the service and sacrifice for the good of others will strengthen the spirit of
          beneficence in the giver’s heart, allying us more closely to Him who was rich, yet for our sakes became poor,
          that we through His poverty might be rich. And it is only as we thus imitate the</p>
