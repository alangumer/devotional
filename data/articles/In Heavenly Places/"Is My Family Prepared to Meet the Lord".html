    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
          Saviour Jesus Christ. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Peter.1.11"><span class="ft6">2 Peter
          1:11</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Let parents study the first chapter of the Second Epistle of Peter. Here is represented the exalted excellence
          of Bible truth. It teaches that the Christian’s experience is to be one of steady growth, of constant gain in
          graces and virtues that will give strength to the character and fit the soul for eternal life....</p>
      <p>It is the privilege of parents and children to grow together in the grace of Christ. Those who comply with the
          conditions laid down in the Word will find full provision for their spiritual needs and for power to
          overcome.... The Lord expects parents to make earnest united efforts in</p>
      <p>the training of their children for Him. In the home they are to cultivate the graces of the Spirit, in all
          their ways acknowledging Him who through the sanctification of the Spirit has promised to make us perfect in
          every good work....</p>
      <p>Shall the people who have a solemn message to bear for the enlighten- ment and salvation of the world, make
          little or no effort for the members of their own family who are unconverted to the truth? Will parents allow
          their minds to be engrossed with trifling matters to the neglect of the <nobr>all-important</nobr> question,
          “Is my family prepared to meet the Lord?” Will they assent to the great truths that are present truth for
          these last days, and be interested to see this message going to other peoples and lands, while they allow
          their children, their most precious possession, to go on unwarned of their danger and unprepared for the
          future? Shall those who, from the Word of God and through the witness of His Spirit, have had clear light
          concerning their duty allow the years to pass without making definite efforts to save their children?</p>
      <p>Christ is waiting for the cooperation of human agencies, that He may impress the hearts of our children and
          youth. With intense desire heavenly beings long to see parents making that preparation which is essential if
          they and their children stand loyal to God in the coming conflict, and enter</p>
