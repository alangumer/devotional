    <h1>Ask in Faith, March 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and
          ye shall have them. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Mark.11.24"><span class="ft6">Mark
          11:24</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>“If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which
          is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.7.11"><span class="ft10">Matthew 7:11</span></a>). These
          gifts are freely given to us by God. Oh, how weak is our faith, that we do not avail ourselves of the rich,
          glorious promises of God! It is His nature to bestow His gifts upon us. <nobr>All-wise</nobr> and
          <nobr>all-powerful,</nobr> He will give liberally to all who ask in faith. He is more merciful, more tender,
          more patient and loving than any earthly parent.</p>
      <p>The believer in Christ is consecrated to high and holy purpose....</p>
      <p>Called according to God’s purpose, set apart by grace divine, invested with Christ’s righteousness, imbued with
          the Holy Spirit, offering up the sacrifices of a broken and contrite heart, the true believer is indeed a
          representative of the Redeemer.</p>
      <p>Upon such a worshiper, God looks with delight. He will let His light shine into the chambers of the mind and
          into the soul temple if men, when they lack wisdom, will go to their closets in prayer and ask wisdom from Him
          who gives to all men liberally and upbraids not. The promise is, “It shall be given him. But let him ask in
          faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.1.5"><span class="ft21">James 1:5, 6</span></a>).... Show a
          firm, undeviating trust in God. Be ever true to</p>
      <p>principle. Waver not....</p>
      <p>All things are possible to those that believe. No one coming to the Lord in sincerity of heart will be
          disappointed. How wonderful it is that we can pray effectually, that unworthy, erring mortals possess the
          power of offering their requests to God!</p>
      <p>What higher power can man require than <nobr>this—to</nobr> be linked with the infinite God? Feeble, sinful man
          has the privilege of speaking to his Maker. We utter words that reach the throne of the Monarch of the
          universe. We pour out our heart’s desire in our closets. Then we go forth</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[82]</span><span class="ft27">to walk with God as did Enoch.</span></p>
