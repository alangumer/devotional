    <h1>A Chain of Earnest, Praying Believers, March 27</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even
          as it is with you. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.2.Thessalonians.3.1"><span class="ft6">2
          Thessalonians 3:1</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Among God’s people there should be at this time frequent seasons of sincere, earnest prayer. The mind should
          constantly be in a prayerful attitude. In the home and in the church let earnest prayers be offered in behalf
          of those who have given themselves to the preaching of the Word. Let believers pray as did the disciples after
          the ascension of Christ.</p>
      <p>A chain of earnest, praying believers should encircle the world. Let all pray in humility. A few neighbors may
          meet together to pray for the Holy Spirit. Let those who cannot leave home, gather in their children, and
          unite in learning to pray together. They may claim the promise of the Saviour: “Where two or three are
          gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.18.20"><span class="ft10">Matthew 18:20</span></a>).</p>
      <p>There is nothing more needed in the work than the practical results of communion with God. We should hold
          convocations for prayer, asking the Lord to open the way for the truth to enter the strongholds where Satan
          has set up his throne, and dispel the shadow he has cast athwart the pathway of those whom he is seeking to
          deceive and destroy. We have the assurance, “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much”
          (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.5.16"><span class="ft21">James 5:16</span></a>).</p>
      <p>In the Lord’s Prayer we have an example of a perfect petition. How simple, yet how comprehensive it is! This
          prayer should be taught to the children. Let all study carefully the principles contained in it. In response
          to the prayers of God’s people, angels are sent with heavenly blessings....</p>
      <p>Through daily prayer and consecration all may so relate themselves to their heavenly Father that He can bestow
          upon them rich blessings....</p>
      <p>Oh, how differently many would act were God to draw aside the veil that hides Him from our eyes, and reveal
          Himself seated on His throne in the high and holy place, not in silent grandeur, but surrounded with ten
          thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of holy, happy</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[94]</span><span class="ft27">beings, waiting to do His bidding!</span></p>
