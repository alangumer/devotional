    <h1>Let Us Ask of God, March 1</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not;
          and it shall be given him. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.James.1.5"><span class="ft6">James
          1:5</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the privilege of every believer first to talk with God in his closet, and then as God’s mouthpiece to
          talk with others. In order that we may have something to impart, we must daily receive light and blessing. Men
          and women who commune with God, who have an abiding Christ, who, because they cooperate with holy angels, are
          surrounded with holy influ- ences, are needed at this time. The cause needs those who have power to draw with
          Christ, power to express the love of God in words of encour- agement and sympathy.</p>
      <p>As the believer bows in supplication before God, and in humility and contrition offers his petition from
          unfeigned lips, he loses all thought of self. His mind is filled with the thought of what he must have in
          order to build up a Christlike character. He prays, “Lord, if I am to be a channel through which Thy love is
          to flow day by day and hour by hour, I claim by faith the grace and power that Thou hast promised.” He fastens
          his hold firmly on the promise, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, ...</p>
      <p>and it shall be given him.”</p>
      <p>How this dependence pleases the Master! How He delights to hear the steady, earnest pleading! ... With
          wonderful and ennobling grace the Lord sanctifies the humble petitioner, giving him power to perform the most
          difficult duties. All that is undertaken is done unto the Lord, and this elevates and sanctifies the lowliest
          calling. It invests with new dignity every word, every act, and links the humblest worker ... with the highest
          of the angels in the heavenly courts....</p>
      <p>The sons and daughters of God have a great work to do in the world. They are to accept the Word of God as the
          man of their counsel and to impart it to others. They are to diffuse light. All who have received the
          engrafted word will be faithful in giving that word to others. They will speak the words of Christ. In
          conversation and in deportment they will give evidence of a daily conversion to the principles of truth. Such
          believers will be a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men, and God</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[68]</span><span class="ft27">will be glorified in them.</span></p>
