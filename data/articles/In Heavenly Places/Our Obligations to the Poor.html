    <h1>Our Obligations to the Poor, November 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye</strong></p>
      <p>gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
          was in prison, and ye came unto me. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.25.35"><span

      <p>While the world needs sympathy, while it needs the prayers and as- sistance of God’s people, while it needs to
          see Christ in the lives of His followers, the people of God are equally in need of opportunities that draw out
          their sympathies, give efficiency to their prayers, and develop in them a character like that of the divine
          pattern.</p>
      <p>It is to provide these opportunities that God has placed among us the poor, the unfortunate, the sick, and the
          suffering. They are Christ’s legacy to His church, and they are to be cared for as He would care for them. In
          this way God takes away the dross and purifies the gold, giving us that culture of heart and character which
          we need.</p>
      <p>The Lord could carry forward His work without our cooperation. He is not dependent on us for our money, our
          time, or our labor. But the church is very precious in His sight. It is the case which contains His jewels,
          the fold which encloses His flock, and He longs to see it without spot or blemish or any such things. He
          yearns after it with unspeakable love. This is why He has given us opportunities to work for Him, and He
          accepts our labors as tokens of our love and loyalty.</p>
      <p>In placing among us the poor and the suffering, the Lord is testing us to reveal to us what is in our
          hearts.... The culture of the mind and heart is</p>
      <p>more easily accomplished when we feel such tender sympathy for others that we bestow our benefits and
          privileges to relieve their necessities....</p>
      <p>Good works cost us a sacrifice, but it is in this very sacrifice that they provide discipline. These
          obligations bring us into conflict with natural feelings and propensities, and in fulfilling them we gain
          victory after victory over the objectionable traits of our characters.</p>
      <p>The world will be convinced not so much by what the pulpit teaches as by what the church lives. The preacher
          announces the theory of the</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[325]</span><span class="ft27">gospel, but the practical piety of the church demonstrates its
          power.</span></p>
