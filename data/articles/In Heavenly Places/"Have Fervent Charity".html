    <h1>“Have Fervent Charity”, October 13</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for</strong></p>
      <p>charity shall cover the multitude of sins. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.4.8"><span
          class="ft9">1 Peter 4:8</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Followers of Christ will not exhibit characteristics that are cheap and selfish, but in word, spirit, and
          action they will reveal the tenderness of Christ.... A domineering, overbearing spirit is not of God and
          should not</p>
      <p>be exercised toward believers or unbelievers, however lowly may be their station. Christians are required to
          represent Christ in all their dealings with those for whom He has given His precious life....</p>
      <p>He who continually beholds Christ will make it manifest in his spirit, in his words, in his course of action.
          He will not crowd anyone, will not push tried souls into stronger temptation or indifferently leave them on
          Satan’s battleground. He will reach out a hand to help and seek to draw souls upward and heavenward. As a
          laborer together with God he will see to it that the feet of the tempted ones are firmly planted on the Rock
          of Ages....</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the forgiving love of Christ.... We should let those</p>
      <p>who are in danger understand that we appreciate them, that we are not willing to give them up. Speak to them,
          pray with them, and exhort them in love....</p>
      <p>The religion of the Bible is to guide the conduct of everyone who sincerely believes in Christ. The Bible must
          guide us in our dealings in daily life. We may make a profession of being followers of Christ, and yet if we
          are not doers of His Word we shall be like the counterfeit coin. We shall not have the right ring. Everyone of
          us is a member of the human family. We owe it to God to love Him, to manifest affection for Him in our ways
          and words. We owe it to every member of the human family, whether black or white, high or low, to treat him
          with kindness and to manifest interest for his soul. As members of one family we are all brethren....</p>
      <p>Children of God are citizens of heaven. They are the purchase of the Son of God, His <nobr>blood-bought</nobr>
          family. Every soul is precious in His sight,</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[294]</span><span class="ft27">more precious than fine gold, even the golden wedge of
          Ophir.</span></p>
