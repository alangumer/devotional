    <h1>The Spirit of Submission, March 23</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Pray without ceasing. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Thessalonians.5.17"><span
          class="ft9">1 Thessalonians 5:17</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Pray often to your heavenly Father. The oftener you engage in prayer, the closer your soul will be drawn into a
          sacred nearness to God. The Holy Spirit will make intercession for the sincere petitioner with groanings which
          cannot be uttered, and the heart will be softened and subdued by the love of God. The clouds and shadows which
          Satan casts about the soul will be dispelled by the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, and the chambers
          of mind and heart will be illuminated by the light of Heaven.</p>
      <p>But be not discouraged if your prayers do not seem to obtain an im- mediate answer. The Lord sees that prayer
          is often mixed with earthliness. Men pray for that which will gratify their selfish desires, and the Lord does
          not fulfill their requests in the way which they expect. He takes them through tests and trials, He brings
          them through humiliations, until they see more clearly what their necessities are. He does not give to men
          those things which will gratify a debased appetite and which will prove an injury to the human agent and make
          him a dishonor to God. He does not give men that which will gratify their ambition and work simply for
          <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> When we come to God we must be submissive and contrite of heart, subordinating
          everything to His sacred will.</p>
      <p>In the Garden of Gethsemane, Christ prayed to His Father, saying, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
          pass from me” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.26.39"><span class="ft39">Matthew
          26:39</span></a>). The cup which He prayed should be removed from Him, that looked so bitter to His soul, was
          the cup of separation from God in consequence of the sin of the world.... “Nevertheless not what I will, but
          what thou</p>
      <p>wilt” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.26.39"><span class="ft19">Matthew
          26:39</span></a>). The spirit of submission that Christ manifested in offering up His prayer before God is the
          spirit that is acceptable to God. Let the soul feel its need, its helplessness, its nothingness; let all its
          energies be called forth in an earnest desire for help, and help will come....</p>
      <p>Let faith pierce the darkness. Walk with God in the dark as well as in the light, repeating the words, “He is
          faithful that promised” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.10.23"><span
          class="ft30">Hebrews</span></a></p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[90]</span><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.10.23"><span
          class="ft44">10:23</span></a>). Through the trial of our faith we shall be trained to trust in God.</p>
