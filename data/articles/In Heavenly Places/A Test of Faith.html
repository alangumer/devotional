    <h1>A Test of Faith, April 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an
          inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Hebrews.11.8"><span class="ft6">Hebrews
          11:8</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>God selected Abraham as His messenger through whom to commu- nicate light to the world. The word of God came to
          him, not with the presentation of flattering prospects in this life of large salary, of great appreciation and
          worldly honor. “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land
          that I will shew thee” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Genesis.12.1"><span class="ft17">Genesis
          12:1</span></a>), was the divine message to Abraham. The patriarch obeyed.... He forsook his country, his
          home, his relatives, and all pleasant</p>
      <p>associations connected with his early life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger.</p>
      <p>Abraham ... might have reasoned and questioned the purposes of God in this. But he showed that he had perfect
          confidence that God was leading him; he did not question whether it was a fertile, pleasant country or whether
          or not he should have ease. He went at God’s bidding. This is a lesson to every one of us....</p>
      <p>There are those who may be in favorable positions ... in all the things of this life, but God may have a work
          for them to do elsewhere, a work that they could not do among their relatives and friends. The very position
          of ease and the relatives who surround them may prevent them from developing the very traits of character
          which God would have them develop. But God sees that to change their position and to send them where their
          surroundings will be entirely different will be the very best place for them to develop a character which will
          glorify Him....</p>
      <p>When we set ourselves where all is convenience and ease, we do not feel so much the necessity of depending
          moment by moment upon God. God in His providence brings us into positions where we shall feel our necessity of
          His help and strength....</p>
      <p>It is stated of Abraham that he looked for a city whose builder and maker is God.... So with every one of us.
          We are only pilgrims and</p>
      <p>strangers in this world. We are seeking the city which Abraham looked</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[113]</span><span class="ft27">for, whose builder and maker is God.</span></p>
