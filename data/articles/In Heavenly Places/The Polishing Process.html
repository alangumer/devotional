    <h1>The Polishing Process, September 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange
          thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his
          glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Peter.4.12"><span class="ft6">1 Peter 4:12,
          13</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Not without a purpose does God send trial to His children. He never leads them otherwise than they would choose
          to be led if they could see the end from the beginning, and discern the glory of the purpose which they are
          fulfilling as workers together with Him. He subjects them to discipline to humble them, to lead them, through
          trial and affliction, to see their weakness and draw near to Him....</p>
      <p>Christians are Christ’s jewels. They are to shine brightly for Him, shedding forth the light of His loveliness.
          Their luster depends on the polishing they receive. They may choose to be polished or to remain unpolished.
          But everyone who is pronounced worthy of a place in the Lord’s temple must submit to the polishing process.
          Without the polishing that the Lord gives, they can reflect no more light than a common pebble. Christ says to
          man, You are mine. I have bought you. You are now only a rough stone; but if you will place yourself in My
          hands, I will polish you, and the luster with which you shall shine will bring honor to My name. No man shall
          pluck you out of My hand. I will make you My peculiar treasure. On My coronation day, you will be a jewel in
          My crown of rejoicing.</p>
      <p>The Divine Worker spends little time on worthless material. Only the precious jewels does He polish after the
          similitude of a palace, cutting away all rough edges. This process is severe and trying; it hurts human pride.
          Christ cuts deep into the experience that man in his <nobr>self-sufficiency</nobr> has regarded as complete
          and takes away <nobr>self-uplifting</nobr> from the character. He cuts away the surplus surface, and putting
          the stone to the polishing wheel, presses it close, that all roughness may be worn away. Then, holding the
          jewel up to the light, the Master sees in it a reflection of Himself, and He pronounces it worthy of a place
          in His casket. Blessed</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[268]</span><span class="ft27">be the experience, however severe, that gives new value to the
          stone.</span></p>
