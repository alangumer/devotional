    <h1>An Audience with the Most High, May 7</h1>

      <p><strong>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye
          heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually
          worketh also in you that believe. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Thessalonians.2.13"><span
          class="ft6">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The Bible is God’s voice speaking to us just as surely as though we could hear Him with our ears. The word of
          the living God is not merely written, but spoken. Do we receive the Bible as the oracle of God? If we realized
          the importance of this Word, with what awe would we open it, and with what earnestness would we search its
          precepts. The reading and contemplating of the Scriptures would be regarded as an audience with the Most
          High.</p>
      <p>God’s Word is a message to us to be obeyed, a volume to be perused diligently, and with a spirit willing to
          take in the truths written for the admonition of those upon whom the ends of the world are come. It must not
          be neglected for any other book.... When we open the Bible, let us</p>
      <p>compare our lives with its requirements, measuring our character by the great moral standard of
          righteousness.</p>
      <p>The life of Christ, that gives life to the world, is in His Word. It was by His word that Jesus healed disease
          and cast out demons; by His word He stilled the sea, and raised the dead; and the people bore witness that His
          word was with power. He spoke the Word of God, as He had spoken to all the prophets and teachers of the Old
          Testament. The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ. It is our source of power.</p>
      <p>As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is sus- tained by the Word of God.... As we
          must eat for ourselves in order to</p>
      <p>receive nourishment, so we must receive the Word for ourselves. We are not to obtain it merely through the
          medium of another mind.</p>
      <p>Yes, the Word of God is the bread of life.... It gives immortal vigor</p>
      <p>to the soul, perfecting the experience, and bringing joys that will abide</p>
