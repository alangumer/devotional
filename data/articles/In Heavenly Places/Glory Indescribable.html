    <h1>Glory Indescribable, December 17</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the
          name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and
          that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <a

      <p>The Father’s wisdom and glory shine forth in His [Christ’s] majesty. He is exalted and precious to all who
          believe. But His own personal glory, who can describe it? He comes with His divine nature plainly
          <nobr>revealed—He</nobr> who was denied and rejected by man, who stood at the bar of Pilate as a
          criminal....</p>
      <p>Christ is now acknowledged as the King of Glory. “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.21.9"><span class="ft39">Matthew 21:9</span></a>). The
          question of His divinity is forever settled. Where are those who held the Saviour bound at Pilate’s bar, who
          smote Him in the face, who scourged Him, who drove the nails through His hands and feet? those who mocked Him,
          saying, “He saved others; himself he cannot save....” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.27.42"><span class="ft39">Matthew 27:42</span></a>)? Where
          is</p>
      <p>the puny arm that will be lifted against Him now? The scene is changed. At the name of Jesus every knee shall
          bow, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Christ, Lord of heaven and earth....</p>
      <p>The glory of Christ’s humanity did not appear when He was upon the earth. He was regarded as a man of sorrows,
          and acquainted with grief. We hid as it were our faces from Him. But He was pursuing the path the plan of God
          had devised. That same humanity now appears as He descends from heaven, robed in glory, triumphant,
          exalted.... His</p>
      <p>believing people have made their calling and election sure. They come forth at the first resurrection, and the
          song is sung by innumerable voices, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,
          and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away
          all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
          be any more pain: for the former things are passed away” (<a
