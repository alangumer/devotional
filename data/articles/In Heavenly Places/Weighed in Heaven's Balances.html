    <h1>Weighed in Heaven’s Balances, May 29</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Samuel.2.3"><span class="ft9">1</span></a></strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Samuel.2.3">Samuel 2:3</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>The Lord is a God of knowledge. In His Word He is represented as weighing men, their development of character
          and all their motives, whether they be good or evil....</p>
      <p>It is for the eternal interest of everyone to search his own heart and to improve every <nobr>God-given</nobr>
          faculty. Let all remember that there is not a motive in the heart of any man that the Lord does not clearly
          see. The motives of each one are weighed as carefully as if the destiny of the human agent depended upon this
          one result.... God in heaven is true, and there</p>
      <p>is not a design, however intricate, or a motive, however carefully hidden, that He does not clearly understand.
          He reads the secret devisings of every heart.</p>
      <p>Men may plan out crooked actions for the future, thinking that God does not understand; but in that great day
          when the books are opened, and every man is judged by the things written in the books, those actions will
          appear as they are....</p>
      <p>There are many who need now to consider the words, “TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
          wanting” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Daniel.5.27"><span class="ft10">Daniel
          5:27</span></a>). God’s holy, everlasting, immutable law is the standard by which man is to be tried. This law
          defines what we shall do and what we shall not do, saying, Thou shalt, and, Thou shalt not. This law is summed
          up in the two great principles, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
          and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.10.27"><span class="ft10">Luke 10:27</span></a>).</p>
      <p>This means just what it says. O how few will be prepared to meet the law of God in the great day of judgment!
          ... Man, weighed against God’s holy law, is found wanting.</p>
      <p>We are enlightened by the precepts of the law, but no man can by them be justified. Weighed and found wanting
          is our inscription by nature. But Christ is our mediator, and accepting Him as our Saviour, we may claim the
          promise, “Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through</p>
