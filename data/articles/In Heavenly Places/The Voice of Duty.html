    <h1>The Voice of Duty, August 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ecclesiastes.9.10">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a><span

      <p>The voice of duty is the voice of <nobr>God—an</nobr> inborn, <nobr>heaven-sent</nobr> guide. Whether it be
          pleasing or unpleasing, we are to do the duty that lies directly in our pathway. If the Lord would have us
          bear a message to Nineveh, it will not be pleasing to Him for us to go to Joppa or Capernaum. God has reasons
          for sending us to the place to which our feet are directed....</p>
      <p>It is the little foxes that spoil the vines, the little neglects, the little deficiencies, the little
          dishonesties, the little departures from principle, that blind the soul and separate it from God.</p>
      <p>It is the little things of life that develop the spirit and determine the character. Those who neglect the
          little things will not be prepared to endure severe tests when they are brought to bear upon them. Remember
          that the character building is not finished till life ends. Every day a good or bad brick is placed in the
          structure. You are either building crookedly or with the exactness and correctness that will make a beautiful
          temple for God. Therefore, in looking for great things to do, neglect not the little opportunities that come
          to you day by day. He who neglects the little things, and yet flatters himself that he is ready to do
          wonderful things for the Master, is in danger of failing altogether. Life is made up, not of great sacrifices
          and of wonderful achievements, but of little things.</p>
      <p>Whatever your hands find to do, do it with your might. Make your work pleasant with songs of praise. If you
          would have a clean record in the books of heaven, never fret or scold. Let your daily prayer be, “Lord, help
          me to do my best.... Give me energy and cheerfulness. Help me to</p>
      <p>bring into my service the loving ministry of the Saviour.”</p>
      <p>Look upon every duty, however humble, as sacred because it is part of God’s service. Do not allow anything to
          make you forgetful of God. Bring Christ into all that you do. Then your lives will be filled with brightness
          and thanksgiving. You will do your best, moving forward cheerfully in</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[227]</span><span class="ft27">the service of the Lord, your hearts filled with His
          joy.</span></p>
