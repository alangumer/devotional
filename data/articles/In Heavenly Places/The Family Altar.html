    <h1>The Family Altar, July 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the</strong></p>
      <p>name of the Lord. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Genesis.12.8"><span class="ft9">Genesis
          12:8</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Abraham, the friend of God, set us a worthy example. His was a life of prayer and humble obedience, and he was
          as a light in the world. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his altar, calling for the
          morning and evening sacrifice of each member of his family....</p>
      <p>From Christian homes a similar light should shine forth. Love should be revealed in action. It should flow out
          in all home intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish courtesy. There are homes
          where these principles are carried <nobr>out—homes</nobr> where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From
          these homes morning and evening prayer comes up before God as sweet incense, and His mercies and blessings
          descend upon the suppliants like the morning dew.</p>
      <p>We must have more religion. We need the strength and grace that are born of earnest prayer. This means of grace
          should be diligently used in order to gain spiritual muscle. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings
          us up to Him. It makes us realize more and more our great needs, and hence our obligation to God and our
          dependence upon Him. It leads us to feel our own nothingness and the weakness of our judgment. God has made
          earnest prayer the condition of the bestowal of His richest blessings....</p>
      <p>This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself and your family to God for that day. Make no
          calculation for months or years, for they are not yours. One brief day is given you, and that one day work for
          yourself and your family as though it were your last. Surrender all your plans to God, to be carried out or
          given up, as His providence shall indicate. In this manner you may day by day be giving your life with its
          plans and purposes into the hands of God, accepting His plans instead of your own, no matter how much they may
          interfere with your arrangements nor how many pleasant projects may have to be abandoned. Thus the life will
          be molded more and more after the divine Model; and “the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
          keep your hearts and minds</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[214]</span><span class="ft27">through Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
