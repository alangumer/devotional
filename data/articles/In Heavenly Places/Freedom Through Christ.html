    <h1>Freedom Through Christ, May 19</h1>

      <p><strong>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with
          the yoke of bondage.</strong></p>

      <p>In the beginning God placed man under law as an indispensable con- dition of his very existence. He was a
          subject of the divine government, and there can be no government without law....</p>
      <p>God is omnipotent, omniscient, immutable. He always pursues a straightforward course. His law is
          <nobr>truth—immutable,</nobr> eternal truth. His precepts are consistent with His attributes. But Satan makes
          them appear in a false light. By perverting them, he seeks to give human beings an unfavorable impression of
          the Lawgiver. Throughout his rebellion he has sought to represent God as an unjust, tyrannical being....</p>
      <p>As a result of Adam’s disobedience every human being is a transgres- sor of the law, sold under sin. Unless he
          repents and is converted, he is under bondage to the law, serving Satan, falling into the deceptions of the
          enemy, and bearing witness against the precepts of Jehovah. But by perfect obedience to the requirements of
          the law, man is justified. Only through faith in Christ is such obedience possible. Men may comprehend the
          spirituality of the law, they may realize its power as a detector of sin, but they are helpless to withstand
          Satan’s power and deceptions, unless they accept the atonement provided for them in the remedial sacrifice of
          Christ, who is our <nobr>Atonement—our</nobr><nobr>At-one-ment—with</nobr> God.</p>
      <p>Those who believe on Christ and obey His commandments are not under bondage to God’s law; for to those who
          believe and obey, His law is not a law of bondage, but of liberty. Everyone who believes on Christ, everyone
          who relies on the keeping power of a risen Saviour that has suffered the penalty pronounced upon the
          transgressor, everyone who resists temptation and in the midst of evil copies the pattern given in the Christ
          life, will through faith in the atoning sacrifice of Christ become a partaker of the divine nature, having
          escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Everyone who by faith obeys God’s commandments will
          reach the condition of sinlessness in which Adam lived before his</p>
