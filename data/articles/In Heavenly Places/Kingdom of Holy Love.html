    <h1>Kingdom of Holy Love, December 31</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign
          for ever and ever. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Revelation.11.15"><span class="ft6">Revelation
          11:15</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>The government of the kingdom of Christ is like no earthly govern- ment. It is a representation of the
          characters of those who compose the kingdom.... His court is one where holy love presides and whose
          offices</p>
      <p>and appointments are graced by the exercise of charity. He charges His servants to bring pity and
          <nobr>loving-kindness,</nobr> His own attributes, into all their office work....</p>
      <p>The power of Christ alone can work the transformation in heart and mind that all must experience who would
          partake with Him of the new life in the kingdom of God.... In order to serve Him aright, we must be</p>
      <p>born of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind and give us a new capacity for knowing
          and loving God. It will give us willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true worship.</p>
      <p>“Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the
          stakes thereof shall ever be re- moved, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the
          glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams.... For</p>
      <p>the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King; he will save us.... And the inhabitant
          shall not say, I am sick: the people that</p>
      <p>dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity” (<a

      <p>“Be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create,” the Lord exhorts; “for, behold, I create Jerusalem a
          rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of
          weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.... And</p>
      <p>they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They
          shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the
          days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.... They</p>
      <p>shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord” (<a
