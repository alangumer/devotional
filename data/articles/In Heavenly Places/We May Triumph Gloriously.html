      <p><strong>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have</strong></p>
      <p>peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I</p>
      <p>have overcome the world. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.16.33"><span class="ft9">John
          16:33</span></a>.</p>
      <p>“These things have I spoken unto you,” the Saviour said, “that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy
          might be full” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.15.11"><span class="ft10">John
          15:11</span></a>). The work of overcoming is not a joyless work; no, indeed. It means communication with
          Heaven. You can go to God in prayer; you can ask, and receive; you can believe, hanging your helpless soul on
          Christ. It means that humanity can work the will and ways of God. Humanity and divinity are combined for this
          very purpose.</p>
      <p>God sends trials to prove who will stand faithful under temptation. He brings us into trying positions to see
          if we will trust in a power out of and above ourselves. Everyone has undiscovered traits of character that
          must come to light through trial. God allows those who are <nobr>self-sufficient</nobr> to be sorely tempted
          that they may understand their helplessness. He suffers the deep waters of affliction to go over our souls, in
          order that we may know Him and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, in order that we may have deep heart longings to
          be cleansed from defilement, and may come forth from the trial purer, holier, happier. Often we enter the
          furnace of affliction with our souls darkened with selfishness; but if patient under the crucial test, we
          shall come forth reflecting the divine character. When His purpose in the affliction is accomplished “he shall
          bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Psalm.37.6"><span class="ft17">Psalm 37:6</span></a>).</p>
      <p>“Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Mark.14.38"><span class="ft21">Mark 14:38</span></a>). Watch against
          the stealthy approach of the enemy, watch against old habits and natural inclinations, lest they assert
          themselves; force them back, and watch. Watch the thoughts, watch the plans, lest they become
          <nobr>self-centered.</nobr> Watch over the souls that Christ has purchased with His own blood. Watch for
          opportunities to do them good.</p>
      <p>A great crisis is just before us. To meet its trials and temptations and to perform its duties will require
          persevering faith. But we may triumph gloriously; not one watching, praying, believing soul will be ensnared
          by</p>
