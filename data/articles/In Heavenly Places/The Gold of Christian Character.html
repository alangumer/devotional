    <h1>The Gold of Christian Character, June 15</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving</strong></p>
      <p>favour rather than silver and gold. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Proverbs.22.1"><span
          class="ft9">Proverbs 22:1</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Men may aspire to renown. They may desire to possess a great name. With some the possession of houses and lands
          and plenty of money, that which will make them great according to the measure of the world, is the height of
          their ambition. They desire to reach the place where they can look down with a sense of superiority upon those
          who are poor. All such are building on the sand, and their house will fall suddenly. Superiority of position
          is not true greatness. That which does not increase the value of the soul is of no real value in itself. That
          which alone is worth obtaining is greatness of soul in the sight of Heaven. The true and exalted nature of
          your work you may never know. The value of your own being you can only measure by the value of that Life given
          to save all who will receive it.</p>
      <p>Every man will have some estimate of his own worth when he becomes a laborer together with Christ, doing the
          work that Christ did, filling the world with Christ’s righteousness, bearing a commission from the Most
          High.... The commission given to the disciples is given to all who are</p>
      <p>connected with Christ. They are to make any and every sacrifice for the joy of seeing souls saved who are
          perishing out of Christ....</p>
      <p>The highest honor that can be conferred upon human beings, be they young or old, rich or poor, is to be
          permitted to lift up the oppressed, to comfort the <nobr>feeble-minded.</nobr> The world is full of suffering.
          Go, and preach the gospel to the poor; heal the sick. This is the work to be connected with the gospel
          message. “The poor have the gospel preached to them” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.11.5"><span class="ft17">Matthew 11:5</span></a>).
          Colaborers with God are to fill the space they occupy in the world with the love of Jesus.... The love of
          Christ in the heart is</p>
      <p>expressed in the actions. If love for Christ is dull the love for those for whom Christ died will
          degenerate....</p>
      <p>True riches are genuine faith and genuine love. These make the character complete in Christ. If there were more
          faith, simple, trusting faith in Jesus, there would be love, pure love, which is the gold of Christian</p>
