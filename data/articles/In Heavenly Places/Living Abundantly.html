    <h1>Living Abundantly, February 23</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it</strong></p>
      <p>more abundantly. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.10.10"><span class="ft9">John
          10:10</span></a>.</p>
      <p>There can be no such thing as a narrow life for any soul connected with Christ. Those who love Jesus with heart
          and mind and soul and their neighbor as themselves have a broad field in which to use their ability and
          influence. There is no talent to be used for selfish gratification. Self must die, and our lives be hid with
          Christ in God....</p>
      <p>The Lord would have us value our souls according to the <nobr>estimate—as</nobr> far as we can comprehend
          <nobr>it—that</nobr> Christ has placed upon them.... Jesus</p>
      <p>died that He might redeem man from eternal ruin. Then we are to hold ourselves as property purchased. “Ye are
          not your own.” “Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
          God’s” (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.6.19"><span class="ft17">1 Corinthians
          6:19, 20</span></a>). All our powers of mind and soul and body are the Lord’s. Our time belongs to Him. We are
          to place ourselves in the very best possible condition to do His service, keeping constantly in connection
          with Christ, and considering daily the costly sacrifice made for us that we should be made the righteousness
          of God in Him....</p>
      <p>Those who are emptied of self, the thoughtful and conscientious, cannot raise their eyes to Christ, the living
          Saviour, without feelings of awe and the deepest humility. To behold Jesus continually will make the soul
          alive unto God. We shall love Jesus, we shall love the Father who sent Him into the world, for we see Him in a
          wondrous light, full of grace and truth. Jesus declares, “All things are delivered unto me of my Father” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.11.27"><span class="ft10">Matthew 11:27</span></a>); ...
          “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.28.18"><span class="ft10">Matthew 28:18</span></a>). What
          for? That He may give gifts unto men, that they may lay all their powers under tribute to make known the
          wondrous love wherewith He hath loved us....</p>
      <p>When we estimate all our talents in the light of the cross of Calvary, we shall so live for Christ and so let
          our light shine before men that our</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[61]</span><span class="ft27">lives will never seem narrow. Who can estimate the value of the
          soul?</span></p>
