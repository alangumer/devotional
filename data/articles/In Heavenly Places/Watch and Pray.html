    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed</strong></p>
      <p>is willing, but the flesh is weak. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Matthew.26.41"><span
          class="ft9">Matthew 26:41</span></a>.</p>
      <p>We are pilgrims and strangers in this world, traveling a path beset with dangers from those who have rejected
          the only One who could save them. Ingenious subterfuges and scientific problems will be held out before us, to
          tempt us to swerve from our allegiance, but we are not to heed them. Let every soul be on the alert. The
          adversary is on your track. Be vigilant, watching carefully lest some masterly snare shall take you
          unaware....</p>
      <p>The experience of the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane contains a lesson for the Lord’s people today....
          They did not realize the necessity</p>
      <p>of watchfulness and earnest prayer in order to withstand temptation. Many today are fast asleep, as were the
          disciples. They are not watching and praying lest they enter into temptation. Let us often read and give
          careful study to those portions of God’s Word that have special reference to these last days, pointing out the
          dangers that will threaten God’s people.</p>
      <p>We need keen, sanctified perception. This perception is not to be used in criticizing and condemning one
          another, but in discerning the signs of the times. We are to keep our hearts with all diligence that we may
          not make shipwreck of faith. Those who neglect to watch and pray in these days of peril; those who neglect to
          unite with their brethren in seeking the Lord, but who stand aloof from God’s appointed agencies in the
          church, are in grave danger of strengthening themselves in their own way, following the impulses of their own
          minds, and of refusing to heed the admonitions of the Lord....</p>
      <p>Let every believer closely examine himself to ascertain what are his weak points. Let him cherish a spirit of
          humility and plead with the Lord for grace and wisdom and for the faith that works by love and purifies the
          soul. Let him cast away all <nobr>self-confidence....</nobr><nobr>Self-confidence</nobr> leads to a</p>
      <p>lack of watchfulness.... Those who walk humbly before God, distrustful</p>
      <p>of their own wisdom, will realize their danger and will know the power of</p>
