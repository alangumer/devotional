      <p><strong>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and
          increasing in the knowledge of God. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Colossians.1.10"><span
          class="ft6">Colossians 1:10</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Let us study Paul’s prayer for his Colossian brethren. “For this cause we also,” he wrote, “since the day we
          heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will
          in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
          fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to
          his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Colossians.1.9"><span class="ft10">Colossians</span></a><nobr><a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Colossians.1.9"><span class="ft10">1:9-11</span></a>).</nobr></p>
      <p>How complete this prayer is! There is no limit to the blessings that it is our privilege to receive. We may be
          “filled with the knowledge of his will.” The Holy Ghost would never have inspired Paul to offer this prayer in
          behalf of his brethren if it had not been possible for them to receive an answer from God in accordance with
          the request....</p>
      <p>To the church at Ephesus Paul wrote: “For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
          of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his
          glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
          faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the
          breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
          might be filled with all the fulness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
          that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ
          Jesus throughout all ages, world without end” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.3.14"><span class="ft21">Ephesians</span></a><nobr><a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Ephesians.3.14"><span class="ft21">3:14-21</span></a>).</nobr></p>
      <p>Here are brought to view the possibilities of the Christian life. How far short of reaching this standard falls
          the church of today! ... Self, self, <nobr>self—all</nobr> this is manifest.... When shall we awake? When
          shall we meet</p>
