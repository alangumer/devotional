    <h1>Revealing Christ’s Likeness, June 29</h1>

      <p><strong>The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for
          ever. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.32.17"><span class="ft30">Isaiah
          32:17</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ will be to His people all that these words express if they will heed the invitation to come to Him. He
          will be to them life and power, strength and efficiency, wisdom and holiness. God calls upon us to live the
          Christ life, to reveal this life to the world.</p>
      <p>We can, we can, reveal the likeness of our divine Lord. We can know the science of spiritual life. We can honor
          our Maker. But do we do it? Oh, what an illustrious example we have in the life that Christ lived on this
          earth! He has shown us what we can accomplish through cooperation with divinity. We are to seek for the union
          of which He speaks when He says, “Abide in me, and I in you” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.15.4"><span class="ft17">John 15:4</span></a>). This union is
          deeper, stronger, truer, than any other union and is productive of all good. Those who are thus united to the
          Saviour are controlled by His will and are moved by His love to suffer with those who suffer, to rejoice with
          those who rejoice, to feel a deep sympathy for every one in weakness, sorrow, or distress.</p>
      <p>Wherever I go I shall urge the people to keep Christ uplifted. He is always the same, yesterday, today, and
          forever, always seeking to do us good, always encouraging and guiding us, leading us onward step by step. What
          He is <nobr>today—a</nobr> faithful high priest, touched with the feeling of our <nobr>infirmities—He</nobr>
          will be tomorrow and forevermore. He is our guide, our teacher, our counselor, our friend, ever bestowing His
          blessings upon us in response to our faith. He invites us to abide with Him. When we do this, when we make our
          home with Him, all friction, all ill temper, all irritation, will cease....</p>
      <p>I know that when I ask the Lord to be my helper He will not deny me, because it is my one desire to do His will
          and glorify His name. I am weak, but in depending wholly upon Him, I obtain strength. In laying my burden upon
          the Burden Bearer, I find comfort and strength and hope. This is my <nobr>desire—to</nobr> find abiding rest
          at His feet. While I keep firm hold of His hand, He leads me safely. The living God shall be the joy and</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[188]</span><span class="ft27">rejoicing of my soul.</span></p>
