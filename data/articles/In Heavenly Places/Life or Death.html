    <h1>Life or Death? December 20</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life</strong></p>
      <p>through Jesus Christ our Lord. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.6.23"><span
          class="ft9">Romans 6:23</span></a>.</p>
      <p>“All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Romans.3.23"><span class="ft30">Romans 3:23</span></a>). But Christ
          gave His life to save the sinner from the death sentence. He died that we might live.... By His death He
          brought salvation within the</p>
      <p>reach of all....</p>
      <p>The abundant evidence given by God that He desires the salvation of all, will be the condemnation of those who
          refuse the gift of heaven. At the last great day, when all will be rewarded or punished according to their
          obedience or disobedience, the cross of Calvary will appear plainly before those standing before the Judge of
          all the earth to receive sentence for eternity. They are made capable of comprehending something of the love
          that God has expressed for fallen human beings. They see how greatly He has been dishonored by those who have
          continued in transgression, choosing sides with Satan and showing contempt for the law of Jehovah....</p>
      <p>Today angels are sent to minister to those who shall be heirs of salva- tion, to help them to escape from the
          thralldom of Satan’s power.... Each</p>
      <p>human being is given the freedom of choice. It is his to decide whether he will stand under the black banner of
          rebellion or under the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> banner of Prince Emmanuel. With deep solicitude Heaven
          watches the conflict between good and evil. None but the obedient can enter the gates of the city of God. Upon
          those who choose to continue in transgression the death sentence must at last be pronounced. The earth will be
          purified from their misdoings, their defiance of God....</p>
      <p>God’s law is the transcript of His character, and those only who obey this law will be accepted by Him. Every
          departure from obedience to the law of God is rebellion. It is for the highest interest of man to obey the law
          of God, for conformity to the principles of this law is essential to the formation of a righteous character.
          The rules of life that the Lord has given will make men pure and happy and holy. Those only who obey</p>
      <p>these rules can hear from the lips of Christ the words, “Come up higher.” <span class="ft45">[362]</span></p>
