    <h1>Victory Over Death, December 12</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
          then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.1.Corinthians.15.54"><span class="ft6">1 Corinthians
          15:54</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>“And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Luke.24.36"><span class="ft39">Luke 24:36</span></a>).... Here we
          have before</p>
      <p>us the precious evidence that Christ is a living Saviour. A little while before, He was enclosed in Joseph’s
          new tomb, but He had burst the bands of death and walked forth a triumphant conqueror.... The angel of
          God</p>
      <p>said, He is risen. Wonderful testimony! The hope of the world! Christ had risen and their Saviour was a risen
          Saviour! ... Christ had obtained the victory, and although man had fallen and was condemned to death, yet he
          could live again. Those who sleep in Jesus will be called from their prison house ... to a glorious
          immortality.... He has risen, dear friends,</p>
      <p>and in your despondency you may know ... that Jesus is by your side to give you peace.</p>
      <p>I know what I am talking about. I have seen the time when I thought the waves were going over my head; in that
          time I felt my Saviour precious to me. When my eldest son was taken from me I felt my grief was very great,
          but Jesus came to my side and I felt His peace in my soul. The cup of consolation was placed to my lips.</p>
      <p>And then he who had stood by my side for <nobr>thirty-six</nobr> years ... was taken. We had labored together
          side by side in the ministry, but we had to fold the hands of the warrior and lay him down to rest in the
          silent grave. Again my grief seemed very great, but after all came the cup of consolation. Jesus is precious
          to me. He walked by my side ... and He will walk by your side. When our friends go into the grave they are
          beautiful to us. It may be our father or mother that we lay away: when they come forth those wrinkles are all
          gone but the figure is there, and we know them....</p>
      <p>We want to be prepared to meet these dear friends as they come forth in the resurrection morning.... Shall we
          lay hold upon the hope set before</p>
      <p>us in the gospel that we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is? <span class="ft45">[354]</span></p>
