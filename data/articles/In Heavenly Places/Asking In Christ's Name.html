      <p><strong>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the</strong></p>
      <p>Father may be glorified in the Son. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.John.14.13"><span

      <p>I am so thankful that we can trust in God. And the Lord is honored when we trust in Him, bringing to Him all
          our perplexities.... The Lord</p>
      <p>Jehovah did not deem the principles of salvation complete while invested only with His own love. By His own
          appointment He has placed at His altar an Advocate clothed in our nature. As our Intercessor, His office work
          is to introduce us to God as His sons and daughters. Christ intercedes in behalf of those who have received
          Him. To them He gives power, by virtue of His own merits, to become members of the royal family, children of
          the heavenly King. And the Father demonstrates His infinite love for Christ, who paid our ransom by His blood,
          by receiving and welcoming Christ’s friends as His friends. He is satisfied with the atonement made. He is
          glorified by the incarnation, the life, death, and mediation of His Son.</p>
      <p>In Christ’s name our petitions ascend to the Father. He intercedes in our behalf, and the Father lays open all
          the treasures of His grace for our appropriation, to enjoy and communicate to others. Ask in My name, Christ
          says. I do not say that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father Himself loveth you, because you have
          loved Me. Make use of My name. This will give your prayers efficiency, and the Father will give you the riches
          of His grace. Wherefore ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
      <p>What condescension! What a privilege is granted us! Christ is the connecting link between God and man.... As we
          approach God through</p>
      <p>the virtue of Christ’s merits, we are clothed with His priestly vestments. He places us close by His side,
          encircling us with His human arm, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. He puts His
          merits as sweet incense in a censer in our hands in order to encourage our petitions. He promises to hear and
          answer our supplications. Yes; Christ has become the medium of prayer between man and God. He also has become
          the medium of blessing between God and man. He has combined</p>
