    <h1>Graces to Cherish, August 25</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance: against such there is no law. <a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Galatians.5.22"><span
          class="ft6">Galatians 5:22, 23</span></a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Here is held out the very thing for which we are to labor: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love.” If we have
          the love of Christ in our souls it will be a natural consequence for us to have all the other
          <nobr>graces—joy,</nobr> peace, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance; and “against such there is no law.” The law of God does not condemn and hold in bondage those who
          have these graces, because they are obeying the requirements of the law of God. They are law keepers, and ...
          are not under the bondage of the law....</p>
      <p>We are to have love, and connected with this are joy, peace, long- suffering, patience. We see the restlessness
          of the world, their dissatisfied condition. They want something they have not. They want something to keep up
          an excitement or something for amusement. But for the Christian there is joy, there is peace, there is
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, meekness, forbearance, and patience; and to these things we want to
          open the door of our heart, cherishing the heavenly graces of the Spirit of God.... One</p>
      <p>cannot do it for another. You may set to work and obtain the graces of the Spirit, but that will not answer for
          me.... Each one individually must do</p>
      <p>the work, and determine through personal efforts to have the grace of God in the heart. I cannot form a
          character for you nor can you for me. It is a burden that rests upon every one individually, young or
          old.</p>
      <p>Christ says: “I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir” (<a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.13.12"><span class="ft17">Isaiah 13:12</span></a>). How? By
          the cultivation of the graces of the <nobr>Spirit—love,</nobr> joy, peace, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr>
          gentleness, goodness, meekness, faith. We want the living faith that will grasp the strong arm of Jehovah....
          We all need the graces of the Spirit of</p>
      <p>God in the heart.</p>
      <p>When the love of Christ is enshrined in the heart, like sweet fragrance it cannot be hidden. The holy influence
          it reflects through the character</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[245]</span><span class="ft27">will be manifest to all. Christ will be formed within, “the
          hope of glory.”</span></p>
