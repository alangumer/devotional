    <h1>The Most Powerful Argument, November 7</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour....</strong></p>
      <p>Therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God. <a
          href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.43.11"><span class="ft9">Isaiah</span></a></p>
      <p><a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.43.11">43:11, 12</a><span class="ft12">.</span></p>
      <p>Of His true followers the Lord says, “This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise”
          (<a href="https://egwwritings.org/?ref=en_kjv.Isaiah.43.21"><span class="ft10">verse 21</span></a>). They are
          My witnesses, My chosen representatives, in an apostate world....</p>
      <p>God calls for our cooperation. His requirements are just and reason- able.... When we take the name of Christ
          we pledge ourselves to represent</p>
      <p>Him. In order for us to be true to our pledge, Christ must be formed within, the hope of glory. The daily life
          must become more and more like the Christ life. We must be Christians in deed and in truth. Christ will have
          nothing to do with pretense. He will welcome to the heavenly courts those only whose Christianity is genuine.
          The lives of professed Christians who do not live the life of Christ are a mockery to religion.</p>
      <p>God does not ask us to purchase His favor by any costly sacrifice. He asks only for the service of a humble,
          contrite heart, which has gladly and thankfully accepted His free gift. The one who receives Christ as his
          personal Saviour has in his possession the salvation provided by Christ. And he is never to forget that as he
          has freely received, so he is freely to impart.</p>
      <p>Do you realize your value in the sight of God? He says, Ye are laborers together with Me. Are you letting your
          light shine in clear rays to a fallen world? Are you seeking to exercise every faculty and every power which
          God has given you? You may not be a minister, but you can be a witness. You may not be an eloquent speaker,
          but you can be eloquent in living Christ, you can be eloquent in letting your light shine before men.</p>
      <p>A true, lovable Christian is the most powerful argument that can be advanced in favor of Bible truth. Such a
          man is Christ’s representative. His life is the most convincing evidence that can be borne to the power of
          divine grace. When God’s people bring the righteousness of Christ into the daily life, sinners will be
          converted and victories over the enemy will</p>
      <p><span class="ft3">[319]</span><span class="ft27">be gained.</span></p>
