    <h1>The Disciples Revealed the Love of Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our
          lives for the brethren. 1 John 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>After the ascension of Christ, John stands forth as a faithful, earnest laborer for the Master.... He enjoyed
          the outpouring of the Spirit ... and with fresh zeal and power he</p>
      <p>continued to speak to the people the words of life, seeking to lead their thoughts to the Unseen. He was a
          powerful preacher, fervent, and deeply in earnest. In beautiful language and with a musical voice he told of
          the words and works of Christ, speaking in a way that impressed the hearts of those who heard him. The
          simplicity of his words, the sublime power of the truths he uttered, and the fervor that characterized his
          teachings, gave him access to all classes.</p>
      <p>The apostle’s life was in harmony with his teachings. The love of Christ which glowed in his heart led him to
          put forth earnest, untiring labor for his fellow men, especially for his brethren in the Christian
          church.</p>
      <p>Christ had bidden the ﬁrst disciples love one another as He had loved them. Thus they were to bear testimony to
          the world that Christ was formed within, the hope of glory. “A new commandment I give unto you,” He had said,
          “That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another” (John 13:34). At the time when
          these words were spoken, the disciples could not understand them; but after they had witnessed the sufferings
          of Christ, after His cruciﬁxion and resurrection, and ascension to heaven, and after the Holy Spirit had
          rested on them at Pentecost, they had a clearer conception of the love of God and of the nature of that love
          which they must have for one another....</p>
      <p>After the descent of the Holy Spirit, when the disciples went forth to proclaim a living Saviour, their one
          desire was the salvation of souls. They rejoiced in the sweetness of communion with saints. They were tender,
          thoughtful, <nobr>self-denying,</nobr> willing to make any sacriﬁce for the truth’s sake . In their daily
          association with one another, they revealed the love that Christ had enjoined upon them. By unselﬁsh words and
          deeds they strove to kindle this love in other hearts.</p>
      <p>Such a love the believers were ever to cherish. They were to go forward in willing obedience to the new
          commandment. So closely were they to be united with Christ that they would be enabled to fulﬁll all His
          requirements. Their lives were to magnify the power of a Saviour who could justify them by His
          <nobr>righteousness.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>546-548.</nobr></p>
