      <p><strong>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication
          sinneth against his own body. 1 Corinthians 6:18.</strong></p>
      <p>I have been shown that we live amid the perils of the last days. Because iniquity abounds, the love of many
          waxes cold. The word “many” refers to the professed followers of Christ. They are affected by the prevailing
          iniquity and backslide from God, but it is not necessary that they should be thus affected. The cause of this
          declension is that they do not stand clear from this iniquity. The fact that their love to God is waxing cold
          because iniquity abounds shows that they are, in some sense, partakers in this iniquity, or it would not
          affect their love for God and their zeal and fervor in His cause.</p>
      <p>A terrible picture of the condition of the world has been presented before me. Immorality abounds everywhere.
          Licentiousness is the special sin of this age. Never did vice lift its deformed head with such boldness as
          now. The people seem to be benumbed, and the lovers of virtue and true goodness are nearly discouraged by its
          boldness, strength, and prevalence. The iniquity which abounds is not merely conﬁned to the unbeliever and the
          scoffer. Would that this were the case, but it is not....</p>
      <p>Every Christian will have to learn to restrain his passions and be controlled by principle. The brain nerves
          which communicate with the entire system are the only medium through which Heaven can communicate to man and
          affect his inmost life. Whatever disturbs the circulation of the electric currents in the nervous system
          lessens the strength of the vital powers, and the result is a deadening of the sensibilities of the
          <nobr>mind.—Testimonies</nobr></p>
      <p>for the Church 2:346, 347.</p>
      <p>Moral principle, strictly carried out, becomes the only safeguard of the soul. If ever there was a time when
          the diet should be the most simple kind, it is now.... The less feverish</p>
      <p>the diet, the more easily can the passions be controlled. Gratiﬁcation of taste should not be consulted
          irrespective of physical, intellectual, or moral health....</p>
      <p>God has given you a habitation to care for and preserve in the best condition for His service and glory. Your
          bodies are not your own. “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you,
          which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your
          body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
          God dwelleth in <nobr>you?”—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 2:352, 353.</p>
