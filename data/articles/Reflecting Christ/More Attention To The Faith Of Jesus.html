    <h1>More Attention To “The Faith Of Jesus”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the ﬂesh, justiﬁed in the
          Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. 1
          Timothy 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Many people seem to be ignorant of what constitutes faith. Many complain of darkness and discouragements. I
          asked, Are your faces turned toward Jesus? Are you beholding Him, the Sun of Righteousness? You need plainly
          to deﬁne to the churches the matter of faith and entire dependence upon the righteousness of Christ.... There
          has been so little</p>
      <p>dwelling upon Christ, His matchless love, His great sacriﬁce made in our behalf, that Satan has nearly eclipsed
          the views we should have and must have of Jesus Christ. We must trust less in human beings for spiritual help
          and more, far more, in approaching Jesus Christ as our Redeemer.</p>
      <p>We may dwell with a determined purpose on the heavenly attributes of Jesus Christ; we may talk of His love, we
          may tell and sing of His mercies, we may make Him our own personal Saviour. Then we are one with Christ. We
          love that which Christ loved, we hate sin, that which Christ hated. These things must be talked of, dwelt
          upon....</p>
      <p>We are to keep before the mind the <nobr>sin-pardoning</nobr> Saviour. But we are to present Him in His true
          <nobr>position—coming</nobr> to die to magnify the law of God and make it honorable, and yet to justify the
          sinner who shall depend wholly upon the merits of the blood of a cruciﬁed and risen Saviour....</p>
      <p>The <nobr>soul-saving</nobr> message, the third angel’s message, is the message to be given to the world. The
          commandments of God and the faith of Jesus are both important, immensely important, and must be given with
          equal force and power. The ﬁrst part of the message has been dwelt upon mostly, the last part casually. The
          faith of Jesus is not comprehended. We must talk it, we must live it, we must pray it, and educate the people
          to bring this part of the message into their home life....</p>
      <p>Why are our lips so silent upon the subject of Christ’s righteousness and His love for the world? Why do we not
          give to the people that which will revive and quicken them into a new life? The apostle Paul is ﬁlled with
          transport and adoration as he declares, “Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was
          manifest in the ﬂesh, justiﬁed in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
          world, received up into glory.”...</p>
      <p>The character of Christ is an inﬁnitely perfect character, and He must be lifted up, He must be brought
          prominently into view, for He is the power, the might, the sanctiﬁcation and righteousness of all who believe
          in <nobr>Him.—Manuscript</nobr> 27, 1889.</p>
