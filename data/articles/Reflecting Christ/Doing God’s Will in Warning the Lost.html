    <h1>Doing God’s Will in Warning the Lost</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to
          the Lord, and not to men. Ephesians 6:6, 7.</strong></p>
      <p>Last night a scene was presented before me. I may never feel free to reveal all of it, but I will reveal a
          little.</p>
      <p>It seemed that an immense ball of ﬁre came down upon the world, and crushed large houses. From place to place
          rose the cry, “The Lord has come! The Lord has come!” Many were unprepared to meet Him, but a few were saying,
          “Praise the Lord!”</p>
      <p>“Why are you praising the Lord?” inquired those upon whom was coming sudden destruction.</p>
      <p>“Because we now see what we have been looking for.”</p>
      <p>“If you believed that these things were coming, why did you not tell us?” was the terrible response. “We did
          not know about these things. Why did you leave us in ignorance? Again and again you have seen us; why did you
          not become acquainted with us, and tell us of the judgment to come, and that we must serve God, lest we
          perish? Now we are lost!”</p>
      <p>Every church member is to train the intellect, in order that he may gain a clear understanding of the will of
          God concerning him; everyone is to educate the voice, that he may communicate a knowledge of the Scriptures to
          those who are in ignorance. May God help us to stand, like Daniel, in our lot and place during the days of
          probation that remain.</p>
      <p>Parents, teach your children regarding the things that are coming upon the earth, and lead them to prepare to
          meet their Lord in peace. Gain a knowledge of the Scriptures. Do not ﬁll the head with the nonsense of novels.
          Brain nerve power is required by those who desire to comprehend the truth so clearly that they can teach it
          intelligently to others. We have none too much brainpower. Never can we afford to use tobacco, or alcoholic
          liquors, or any other injurious substance; for we must strive to keep our minds clear for the work of saving
          souls. The Lord is pleased with those who manifest fervid earnestness in His service. It is the privilege of
          everyone to cultivate faithfully every <nobr>God-given</nobr> power.</p>
      <p>In that glad day ... the ransomed ones will exclaim: “Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb that was slain, and lives
          again, a triumphant Conqueror.” What joy the worker will then feel in going to those to whom he has spoken
          with trembling and in <nobr>fearfulness—those</nobr> to whom he has opened the Scriptures and with whom he has
          prayed, thus balancing their souls on the right side.... All His providences will then be made
          <nobr>plain.—Manuscript</nobr> 102, 1904.</p>
