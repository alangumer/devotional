    <h1>Abraham’s Unquestioning Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy father’s
          house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
          make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing. Genesis 12:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>God selected Abraham as His messenger through whom to communicate light to the world. The word of God came to
          him, not with the presentation of ﬂattering prospects in this life of large salary, of great appreciation and
          worldly honor. “Get thee out of thy country ... unto a land that I will shew thee” was the divine message to
          Abraham. The patriarch obeyed, and “went out, not knowing whither he went,” as God’s light bearer, to keep His
          name alive in the earth. He forsook his country, his home, his relatives, and all pleasant associations
          connected with his early life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger....</p>
      <p>Before God can use him, Abraham must be separated from his former associations, that he may not be controlled
          by human inﬂuence or rely upon human aid. Now that he has become connected with God, this man must henceforth
          dwell among strangers. His character must be peculiar, differing from all the world. He could not even explain
          his course of action so as to be understood by his friends, for they were idolaters. Spiritual things must be
          spiritually discerned; therefore his motives and his actions were beyond the comprehension of his kindred and
          friends.</p>
      <p>Abraham’s unquestioning obedience was one of the most striking instances of faith and reliance upon God to be
          found in the Sacred Record. With only the naked promise that his descendants should possess Canaan, without
          the least outward evidence, he followed on where God should lead, fully and sincerely complying with the
          conditions on his part, and conﬁdent that the Lord would faithfully perform His word. The patriarch went
          wherever God indicated his duty; he passed through wildernesses without terror; he went among idolatrous
          nations, with the one thought: “God has spoken; I am obeying His voice; He will guide, He will protect
          me.”</p>
      <p>Just such faith and conﬁdence as Abraham had the messengers of God need today. But many whom the Lord could use
          will not move onward, hearing and obeying the one Voice above all others.... The Lord would do much more for
          His servants if they were wholly</p>
      <p>consecrated to Him, esteeming His service above the ties of kindred and all other earthly
          <nobr>associations.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 4:523, 524.</p>
