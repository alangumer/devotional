    <h1>The Ground of Forgiveness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. Proverbs
          15:29.</strong></p>
      <p>We ourselves owe everything to God’s free grace. Grace in the covenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the
          Saviour effected our redemption, our regeneration, and our exaltation to heirship with Christ. Let this grace
          be revealed to others.</p>
      <p>Give the erring one no occasion of discouragement. Suffer not a Pharisaical hardness to come in and hurt your
          brother. Let no bitter sneer rise in mind or heart. Let no tinge of scorn be manifest in the voice. If you
          speak a word of your own, if you take an attitude of indifference, or show suspicion or distrust, it may prove
          the ruin of a soul. He needs a brother with the Elder Brother’s heart of sympathy to touch his heart of
          humanity. Let him feel the strong clasp of a sympathizing hand, and hear the whisper, Let us pray. God will
          give a rich experience to you both.</p>
      <p>Prayer unites us with one another and with God. Prayer brings Jesus to our side, and gives to the fainting,
          perplexed soul new strength to overcome the world, the ﬂesh, and the devil. Prayer turns aside the attacks of
          Satan.</p>
      <p>When one turns away from human imperfections to behold Jesus, a divine transformation takes place in the
          character. The Spirit of Christ working upon the heart conforms it to His image. Then let it be your effort to
          lift up Jesus. Let the mind’s eye be directed to “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”
          (John 1:29). And as you engage in this work, remember that “he which converteth the sinner from the error of
          his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins” (James 5:20).</p>
      <p>“But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses” (Matthew 6:15).
          Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit. He who is unmerciful toward others shows that he himself is not a
          partaker of God’s pardoning grace. In God’s forgiveness the heart of the erring one is drawn close to the
          great heart of Inﬁnite Love. The tide of divine compassion ﬂows into the sinner’s soul, and from him to the
          souls of others. The tenderness and mercy that Christ has revealed in His own precious life will be seen in
          those who become sharers of His grace....</p>
      <p>We are not forgiven because we forgive, but as we forgive. The ground of all forgiveness is found in the
          unmerited love of God; but by our attitude toward others we show whether we have made that love our
          <nobr>own.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, 250, 251.</p>
