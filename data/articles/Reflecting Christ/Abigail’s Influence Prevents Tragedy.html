    <h1>Abigail’s Inﬂuence Prevents Tragedy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: and
          blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood. 1 Samuel
          25:32, 33.</strong></p>
      <p>The piety of Abigail, like the fragrance of a ﬂower, breathed out all unconsciously in face and word and
          action. The Spirit of the Son of God was abiding in her soul. Her heart was full of purity, and gentleness,
          and sanctiﬁed love. Her speech, seasoned with grace, and full of kindness and peace, shed a heavenly inﬂuence.
          Better impulses came to David, and he trembled as he thought what might have been the consequences of his rash
          purpose. An entire household would have been slain, containing more than one precious,
          <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> person like Abigail, who had engaged in the blessed ministry of good. Her words
          healed the sore and bruised heart of David.</p>
      <p>Would that there were more women who would soothe the irritated feelings, prevent rash impulses, and quell
          great evils by words of calm and <nobr>well-directed</nobr> wisdom. “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they
          shall be called the children of God.”</p>
      <p>A consecrated Christian life is ever shedding light and comfort and peace. It is purity, tact, simplicity, and
          usefulness. It is controlled by that unselﬁsh love that sanctiﬁes the inﬂuence. It is full of Christ, and
          leaves a track of light wherever its possessor may go. Abigail was a wise reprover and counselor. David’s
          passion died away under the power of her inﬂuence and reasoning. He was convinced that he had taken an unwise
          course, and had lost control of his own spirit. He received the rebuke with humility of heart.... He gave</p>
      <p>thanks and blessing because she advised him righteously.</p>
      <p>There are many who, when they are reproved or advised, think it praiseworthy if they receive the rebuke without
          becoming impatient. But how few take reproof with gratitude of heart, and bless those who seek to save them
          from pursuing an evil course.</p>
      <p>Abigail rejoiced that her mission had been successful, and that she had been instrumental in saving her
          household from death. David rejoiced that through her timely advice he had been prevented from committing
          deeds of violence and revenge. Upon reﬂection, he realized that it would have been a matter of disgrace to him
          before Israel, and a remembrance that would always have caused him the keenest remorse. He felt that he and
          his men had the greatest cause for gratitude....</p>
      <p>When David heard the tidings of the death of Nabal, he gave thanks that God had taken vengeance into His own
          <nobr>hands.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, October 26, 1888.</p>
