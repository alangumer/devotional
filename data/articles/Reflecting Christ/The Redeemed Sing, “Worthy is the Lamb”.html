    <h1>The Redeemed Sing, “Worthy is the Lamb!”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit
          of heaviness. Isaiah 61:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Millions went down to the grave loaded with infamy because they steadfastly refused to yield to the deceptive
          claims of Satan.... But now “God is judge himself” (Psalm 50:6).</p>
      <p>Now the decisions of earth are reversed.... They are no longer feeble, afﬂicted, scattered,</p>
      <p>and oppressed. Henceforth they are to be ever with the Lord.</p>
      <p>They stand before the throne clad in richer robes than the most honored of the earth have ever worn. They are
          crowned with diadems more glorious than were ever placed upon the brow of earthly monarchs. The days of pain
          and weeping are forever ended. The King of glory has wiped the tears from all faces; every cause of grief has
          been removed. Amid the waving of palm branches they pour forth a song of praise, clear, sweet, and harmonious;
          every voice takes up the strain, until the anthem swells through the vaults of heaven: “Salvation to our God
          which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” ...</p>
      <p>In this life we can only begin to understand the wonderful theme of redemption.... Yet</p>
      <p>with the utmost stretch of our mental powers we fail to grasp its full signiﬁcance. The length and the breadth,
          the depth and the height, of redeeming love are but dimly comprehended. The plan of redemption will not be
          fully understood, even when the ransomed see as they are seen and know as they are known; but through the
          eternal ages, new truth will continually unfold to the wondering and delighted mind. Though the griefs and
          pains and temptations of earth are ended and the cause removed, the people of God will ever have a distinct,
          intelligent knowledge of what their salvation has cost.</p>
      <p>The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the redeemed through all eternity. In Christ gloriﬁed
          they will behold Christ cruciﬁed.... As the nations of the saved look upon</p>
      <p>their Redeemer and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in His countenance; as they behold His
          throne, which is from everlasting to everlasting, and know that His kingdom is to have no end, they break
          forth in rapturous song: “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and hath redeemed us to God by His own
          most precious blood!” ...</p>
      <p>Mercy, tenderness, and parental love are seen to blend with holiness, justice, and power. While we behold the
          majesty of His throne, high and lifted up, we see His character in its gracious manifestations, and
          comprehend, as never before, the signiﬁcance of that endearing title, “Our <nobr>Father.”—The</nobr> Great
          Controversy, <nobr>650-652.</nobr></p>
