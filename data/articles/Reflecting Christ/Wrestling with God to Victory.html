    <h1>Wrestling with God to Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son
          nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. Ezekiel 14:20.</strong></p>
      <p>Satan leads many to believe that God will overlook their unfaithfulness in the minor affairs of life; but the
          Lord shows in His dealings with Jacob that He will in no wise sanction or tolerate evil. All who endeavor to
          excuse or conceal their sins, and permit them to remain upon the books of heaven, unconfessed and unforgiven,
          will be overcome by Satan. The more exalted their profession and the more honorable the position which they
          hold, the more grievous is their course in the sight of God....</p>
      <p>Jacob’s history is also an assurance that God will not cast off those who have been deceived and tempted and
          betrayed into sin, but who have returned unto Him with true repentance. While Satan seeks to destroy this
          class, God will send His angels to comfort and protect them in the time of peril.</p>
      <p>The assaults of Satan are ﬁerce and determined, his delusions are terrible; but the Lord’s eye is upon His
          people, and His ear listens to their cries. Their afﬂiction is great, the ﬂames of the furnace seem about to
          consume them; but the Reﬁner will bring them forth as gold tried in the ﬁre. God’s love for His children
          during the period of their severest trial, is as strong and tender as in the days of their sunniest
          prosperity; but it is needful for them to be placed in the furnace of ﬁre; their earthliness must be consumed,
          that the image of Christ may be perfectly reﬂected.</p>
      <p>The season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that can endure weariness, delay, and
          <nobr>hunger—a</nobr> faith that will not faint, though severely tried. The period of probation is granted to
          all to prepare for that time. Jacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His victory is an
          evidence of the power of importunate prayer. All who will lay hold of God’s promises, as he did, and be as
          earnest and persevering as he was, will succeed as he succeeded. Those who are unwilling to deny self, to
          agonize before God, to pray long and earnestly for His blessing, will not obtain it.</p>
      <p>Wrestling with <nobr>God—how</nobr> few know what it is! How few have ever had their souls drawn out after God
          with intensity of desire until every power is on the stretch. When waves of despair which no language can
          express sweep over the suppliant, how few cling with unyielding faith to the promises of God....</p>
      <p>If the messengers who bear the last solemn warning to the world would pray ... fervently and in faith, as did
          Jacob, they would ﬁnd many places where they could say: “I have seen God face to face, and my life is
          preserved” (Genesis 32:30). They would be accounted of heaven as princes, having power to prevail with God and
          <nobr>men.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, <nobr>620-622.</nobr></p>
