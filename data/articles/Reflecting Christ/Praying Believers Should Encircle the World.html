    <h1>Praying Believers Should Encircle the World</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Men ought always to pray, and not to faint. Luke 18:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Let our brethren and sisters remember that we are living on the verge of the eternal world. The cases of all
          are being tried in the heavenly courts, and it is high time to put away sin, and to work earnestly to save as
          many as possible.</p>
      <p>Among God’s people there should be, at this time, frequent seasons of sincere, earnest prayer. The mind should
          constantly be in a prayerful attitude. In the home and in the church, let earnest prayers be offered in behalf
          of those who have given themselves to the preaching of the Word. Let believers pray as did the disciples after
          the ascension of Christ.</p>
      <p>The members of our churches need to be converted, to become more <nobr>spiritual-minded.</nobr> A chain of
          earnest, praying believers should encircle the world. Let all pray in humility. A few neighbors may meet
          together to pray for the Holy Spirit. Let those who cannot leave home gather in their children, and unite in
          learning to pray together. They may claim the promise of the Saviour, “Where two or three are gathered
          together in my name, there am I in the midst of them” (Matthew 18:20)....</p>
      <p>In response to the prayers of God’s people, angels are sent with heavenly blessings. The Lord desires us to be
          far more successful in our missionary efforts. Through daily prayer and consecration all may so relate
          themselves to their heavenly Father that He can bestow upon them rich blessings.</p>
      <p>Especially do those young in the faith need to be wide awake, and on their guard against the strategies of
          Satan. They must adhere steadfastly to an unwavering faith in the great atoning sacriﬁce. They need not
          continue in sin. Through prayer they may receive grace that will enable them to overcome....</p>
      <p>How much more might have been accomplished had the time spent by God’s people in faultﬁnding been spent in
          encouraging one another, and in active service! How much better for voices to blend in prayer, in holy unison,
          than to be employed in ﬁnding <nobr>fault!—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 3, 1907.</p>
      <p>The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by
          talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience
          chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of
          <nobr>power.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 203.</p>
      <p>What we want most is...heart power, prayer to God in faith for His converting power....</p>
      <p>It is not brain power or purse power, but heart power, that the people need <nobr>now.—Letter</nobr> 20,
          1890.</p>
