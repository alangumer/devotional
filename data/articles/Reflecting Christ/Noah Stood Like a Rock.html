    <h1>Noah Stood Like a Rock</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.... But
          Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Genesis <nobr>6:6-8.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>The world was arrayed against God’s justice and His laws, and Noah was regarded as fanatic. Satan, when
          tempting Eve to disobey God, said to her, “Ye shall not surely die.” Great men, worldly, honored, and wise
          men, repeated the same story, “Ye shall not surely die.” “The threatenings of God,” they said, “are for the
          purpose of intimidating, and will never be veriﬁed. You need not be alarmed. Such an event as the destruction
          of the world by the God who made it, and the punishment of the beings He has created, will never take place.”
          ... So the people did not humble their hearts before God, but continued their disobedience and wickedness, the
          same as though God had not spoken to them through His servant.</p>
      <p>But Noah stood like a rock amid the tempest. He was surrounded by every species of wickedness and moral
          corruption; but amid popular contempt and ridicule, amid universal wickedness and disobedience, he
          distinguished himself by His holy integrity and unwavering faithfulness. While the world around him were
          disregarding God, and were indulging in all manner of extravagant dissipation which led to violence and crimes
          of every kind, the faithful preacher of righteousness declared to that generation that a ﬂood of water was to
          deluge the world because of the unsurpassed wickedness of its inhabitants. He warned them to repent and
          believe, and ﬁnd refuge in the ark.</p>
      <p>The message of Noah was to him a reality. Amid the scoffs and jeers of the world, he was an unbending witness
          for God. His meekness and righteousness were in bright contrast to the revolting crimes, intrigue, and
          violence continually practiced around him. A power attended his words; for it was the voice of God to man
          through His servant. Connection with God made him strong in the strength of inﬁnite power, while for one
          hundred and twenty years his solemn warning voice fell upon the ears of the men of that generation in regard
          to events, which, so far as human wisdom could judge, seemed impossible. Some were deeply convicted, and would
          have heeded the words of warning; but there were so many to jest and ridicule that they partook of the same
          spirit, resisted the invitations of mercy, refused to reform, and were soon among the boldest and most deﬁant
          scoffers; for none are so reckless, and go to such lengths in sin, as those who have once had light, but have
          resisted the convicting Spirit of God.... How simple and childlike, amid the unbelief of a scofﬁng</p>
      <p>world, was the faith of Noah.... He gave to the world an example of believing just what God</p>
      <p><nobr>said.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, April 1, 1886.</p>
