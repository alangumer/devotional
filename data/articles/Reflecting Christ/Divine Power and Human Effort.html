    <h1>Divine Power and Human Effort</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying
          ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. Titus
          2:11, 12.</strong></p>
      <p>While Christ is cleansing the sanctuary, the worshipers on earth should carefully review their life, and
          compare their character with the standard of righteousness. As they see their defects, they should seek the
          aid of the Spirit of God to enable them to have moral strength to resist the temptations of Satan, and to
          reach the perfection of the standard. They may be victors over the very temptations which seemed too strong
          for humanity to bear; for the divine power will be combined with their human effort, and Satan cannot overcome
          them.</p>
      <p>All heaven has been looking on with interest, and ready to do whatever God might appoint, to help fallen men
          and women to become what God would have them. God will work for His children, but not without their
          cooperation. They must have indomitable energy, and a constant desire to become all that it is possible for
          them to be.</p>
      <p>They should seek to cultivate their powers and develop characters that will be meet for a holy heaven. Then and
          then only will the servants of God be bright and shining lights in the world. Then they will bring energy into
          their Christian life, for they will put all their powers to the task, and respond to the efforts that have
          been made to uplift, reﬁne, and purify them, that they may shine in the courts above. They will bring all
          their powers under the control of the Spirit of God; they will study His Word, and listen for His voice, to
          direct, encourage, strengthen, and advance them in their religious experience.</p>
      <p>They will not be childish and be turned aside by the temptations of Satan. They will deny themselves, not
          appealing to their own sympathies, for they will be of a heroic spirit. They will hoard up the great and
          precious truths of God’s Word; they will feed upon them, and grow into strong, <nobr>well-developed</nobr> men
          and women in Christ, sons and daughters of God.</p>
      <p>The greatness of the truth which they contemplate will expand the mind and elevate the character. They will not
          be novices in the understanding of God’s Word, nor dwarfs in religious experience. Conﬂict with the enemies of
          truth will not shatter them nor weaken their energies; it will only serve to drive them nearer to Him who is
          mighty to save. They will receive the discipline that will give efﬁciency to all their faculties. Heaven will
          be brought near to them in sympathy and cooperation, and they will be indeed a spectacle to the world, to
          angels and to men; for they will be marked characters on account of their purity, their strength of purpose,
          their ﬁrmness, their usefulness in the <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, April 8, 1890.</p>
