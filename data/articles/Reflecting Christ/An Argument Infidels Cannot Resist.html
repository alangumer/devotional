    <h1>An Argument Inﬁdels Cannot Resist</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. John
          12:36.</strong></p>
      <p>A <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> Christian household is an argument that the inﬁdel cannot resist. He ﬁnds no place
          for his cavils [trivial faultﬁnding]. And the children of such a household are prepared to meet the
          sophistries of inﬁdelity. They have accepted the Bible as the basis of their faith, and they have a ﬁrm
          foundation that cannot be swept away by the incoming tide of skepticism.</p>
      <p>Said Christ, “Ye are the light of the world.” He has committed talents to our keeping. What are we doing with
          His entrusted gifts? Are we letting our light shine by using them for His glory and the beneﬁt of our fellow
          men, or are we using them to advance our own selﬁsh interests? Many are using them selﬁshly. They do not seem
          to realize that we are all <nobr>judgment-bound,</nobr> and must soon give an account for the use we have made
          of our <nobr>God-given</nobr> opportunities to do good. But what excuse will they give in that great day for
          not using in the cause of God their skill, their education, their tact, and their perseverance and zeal?</p>
      <p>We need divine help if we would keep our lights burning. But Jesus died to provide that aid. He extends the
          invitation: “Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with
          me.” Cling to the arm of Inﬁnite Power; then you will ﬁnd Him precious to your soul, and all heaven will be at
          your command. “If we walk in the light, as he is in the light,” we shall have the companionship of holy
          angels. To “Joshua” it was said, “Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt
          keep my charge,... I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.” And who are “these that stand
          by”? They are the angels of God. Joshua must have a living, conﬁding trust in God every day; and then angels
          would walk with him, and the power of God would rest upon him in all his labors.</p>
      <p>Then, Christian friends, fathers and mothers, let your light grow <nobr>dim—no,</nobr> never! Let your heart
          grow faint, or your hands <nobr>weary—no,</nobr> never! And by and by the portals of the celestial city will
          be opened to you; and you may present yourselves and your children before the throne, saying, “Here am I, and
          the children whom Thou hast given me.” And what a reward for faithfulness that will be, to see your children
          crowned with immortal life in the beautiful city of <nobr>God!—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, January 14,
          1886.</p>
