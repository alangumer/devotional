    <h1>All To Reveal Christ’s Spirit And Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The ofﬁcers answered, Never man spake like this man. John 7:46.</strong></p>
      <p>When Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, His disciples were gathered close about Him, and the multitude,
          ﬁlled with intense curiosity, also pressed as near as possible. Something more than usual was expected. Eager
          faces and listening attitudes gave evidence of the deep interest. The attention of all seemed riveted upon the
          speaker. His eyes were lighted up with unutterable love, and the heavenly expression upon His countenance gave
          meaning to every word uttered. Angels of heaven were in that listening throng. There, too, was the adversary
          of souls with his evil angels, prepared to counteract, as far as possible, the inﬂuence of the heavenly
          Teacher.</p>
      <p>The truths there uttered have come down through the ages and have been a light amid the general darkness of
          error. Many have found in them that which the soul most <nobr>needed—a</nobr> sure foundation of faith and
          practice. But in these words spoken by the greatest Teacher the world has ever known there is no parade of
          human eloquence. The language is plain, and the thoughts and sentiments are marked with the greatest
          simplicity. The poor, the unlearned, the most <nobr>simple-minded,</nobr> can understand them. The Lord of
          heaven was in mercy and kindness addressing the souls He came to save. He taught them as one having authority,
          speaking the words of eternal life.</p>
      <p>All should copy the Pattern as closely as possible. While they cannot possess the consciousness of power which
          Jesus had, they can so connect with the Source of strength that Jesus can abide in them and they in Him, and
          so His spirit and His power will be revealed in them.</p>
      <p>“Walk in the light, as he is in the light.” It is earthliness and selﬁshness that separate from God. The
          messages from heaven are of a character to arouse opposition. The faithful witnesses for Christ and the truth
          will reprove sin. Their words will be like a hammer to break the ﬂinty heart, like a ﬁre to consume the dross.
          There is constant need of earnest, decided messages of warning. God will have men who are true to duty. At the
          right time He sends His faithful messengers to do a work similar to that of <nobr>Elijah.—Testimonies</nobr>
          for the Church 5:253, 254.</p>
      <p>Men of the highest education in the arts and sciences have learned precious lessons from Christians in humble
          life who were designated by the world as unlearned. But these obscure disciples had obtained an education in
          the highest of all schools. They had sat at the feet of Him who spoke as “never man <nobr>spake.”—The</nobr>
          Desire of Ages, 251.</p>
