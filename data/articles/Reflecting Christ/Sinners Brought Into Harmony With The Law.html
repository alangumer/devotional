    <h1>Sinners Brought Into Harmony With The Law</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the ﬂesh, God sending his own Son in the
          likeness of sinful ﬂesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the ﬂesh: that the righteousness of the law might be
          fulﬁlled in us, who walk not after the ﬂesh, but after the Spirit. Romans 8:3, 4.</strong></p>
      <p>The law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy. While it promises life to the obedient, it declares
          that death is the portion of the transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him from the condemnation
          or the deﬁlement of sin. He must exercise repentance toward God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in
          Christ, His atoning sacriﬁce. Thus he obtains “remission of sins that are past” and becomes a partaker of the
          divine nature. He is a child of God, having received the spirit of adoption, whereby he cries: “Abba,
          Father”!</p>
      <p>Is he now free to transgress God’s law? Says Paul: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid:
          yea, we establish the law” (Romans 3:31). “How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”
          (chap. 6:2). And John declares: “This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments
          are not grievous” (1 John 5:3). In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought
          into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto
          life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of
          alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then “the
          righteousness of the law” will “be fulﬁlled in us, who walk not after the ﬂesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans
          8:4). And the language of the soul will be: “O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day” (Psalm
          119:97).</p>
      <p>“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul” (Psalm 19:7). Without the law, men have no just
          conception of the purity and holiness of God or of their own guilt and uncleanness. They have no true
          conviction of sin and feel no need of repentance. Not seeing their lost condition as violators of God’s law,
          they do not realize their need of the atoning blood of Christ. The hope of salvation is accepted without a
          radical change of heart or reformation of life. Thus superﬁcial conversions abound, and multitudes are joined
          to the church who have never been united to Christ.... By the Word and the Spirit of God</p>
      <p>are opened to men the great principles of righteousness embodied in His <nobr>law.—The</nobr> Great
          Controversy, <nobr>467-469.</nobr></p>
