    <h1>Three Hebrews Display The Power Of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath
          sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him. Daniel 3:28.</strong></p>
      <p>In their wonderful deliverance were displayed, before that vast assembly, the power and majesty of God. Jesus
          placed Himself by their side in the ﬁery furnace, and by the glory of His presence convinced the proud king of
          Babylon that it could be no other than the Son of God. The light of Heaven had been shining forth from Daniel
          and his companions, until all their associates understood the faith which ennobled their lives and beautiﬁed
          their characters. By the deliverance of His faithful servants, the Lord declares that He will take His stand
          with the oppressed and overthrow all earthly powers that would trample upon the authority of the God of
          heaven.</p>
      <p>What a lesson is here given to the fainthearted, the vacillating, the cowardly in the cause of God! What
          encouragement to those who will not be turned aside from duty by threats or peril! These faithful, steadfast
          characters exemplify sanctiﬁcation, while they have no thought of claiming the high honor. The amount of good
          which may be accomplished by comparatively obscure but devoted Christians cannot be estimated until the life
          records shall be made known, when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened.</p>
      <p>Christ identiﬁes His interest with this class; He is not ashamed to call them brethren. There should be
          hundreds where there is now one among us, so closely allied to God, their lives in such close conformity to
          His will, that they would be bright and shining lights, sanctiﬁed wholly, in soul, body, and spirit.</p>
      <p>The conﬂict still goes on between the children of light and the children of darkness. Those who name the name
          of Christ should shake off the lethargy that enfeebles their efforts, and should meet the momentous
          responsibilities that devolve upon them. All who do this may expect the power of God to be revealed in them.
          The Son of God, the world’s Redeemer, will be represented in their words and in their works, and God’s name
          will be <nobr>gloriﬁed.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>40-41.</nobr></p>
      <p>As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in the closing period of earth’s history the Lord will
          work mightily in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the right. He who walked with the Hebrew worthies
          in the ﬁery furnace will be with His followers wherever they are.... His chosen ones will stand
          <nobr>unmoved.—Prophets</nobr> and Kings, 513.</p>
