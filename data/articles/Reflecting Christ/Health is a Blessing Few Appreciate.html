    <h1>Health is a Blessing Few Appreciate</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and
          ye are not your own? 1 Corinthians 6:19.</strong></p>
      <p>Health is a blessing of which few appreciate the value; yet upon it the efﬁciency of our mental and physical
          powers largely depends. Our impulses and passions have their seat in the body, and it must be kept in the best
          condition physically and under the most spiritual inﬂuences in order that our talents may be put to the
          highest use.</p>
      <p>Anything that lessens physical strength enfeebles the mind and makes it less capable of discriminating between
          right and wrong. We become less capable of choosing the good and have less strength of will to do that which
          we know to be right.</p>
      <p>The misuse of our physical powers shortens the period of time in which our lives can be used for the glory of
          God. And it unﬁts us to accomplish the work God has given us to do. By allowing ourselves to form wrong
          habits, by keeping late hours, by gratifying appetite at the expense of health, we lay the foundation for
          feebleness. By neglecting physical exercise, by overworking mind or body, we unbalance the nervous system.
          Those who thus shorten their lives and unﬁt themselves for service by disregarding nature’s laws are guilty of
          robbery toward God.</p>
      <p>And they are robbing their fellow men also. The opportunity of blessing others, the very work for which God
          sent them into the world, has by their own course of action been cut short. And they have unﬁtted themselves
          to do even that which in a briefer period of time they might have accomplished. The Lord holds us guilty when
          by our injurious habits we thus deprive the world of good.</p>
      <p>Transgression of physical law is transgression of the moral law; for God is as truly the author of physical
          laws as He is the author of the moral law. His law is written with His own ﬁnger upon every nerve, every
          muscle, every faculty, which has been entrusted to man. And every misuse of any part of our organism is a
          violation of that law.</p>
      <p>All should have an intelligent knowledge of the human frame that they may keep their bodies in the condition
          necessary to do the work of the Lord. The physical life is to be carefully preserved and developed that
          through humanity the divine nature may be revealed in its fullness. The relation of the physical organism to
          the spiritual life is one of the most important branches of education. It should receive careful attention in
          the home and in the school.... All should place themselves in the best possible relation to life and
          health.</p>
      <p>Our habits should be brought under the control of a mind that is itself under the control of
          <nobr>God.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, <nobr>346-348.</nobr></p>
