    <h1>God’s Law Is Changeless</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be
          lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. John 12:31, 32.</strong></p>
      <p>Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make atonement for its
          transgression. None but Christ could redeem fallen man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into
          harmony with Heaven. Christ would take upon Himself the guilt and shame of <nobr>sin—sin</nobr> so offensive
          to a holy God that it must separate the Father and His Son. Christ would reach to the depths of misery to
          rescue the ruined <nobr>race.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 63.</p>
      <p>The plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper purpose than the salvation of man. It was not for this
          alone that Christ came to the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world might regard
          the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to vindicate the character of God before the universe. To
          this result of His great <nobr>sacriﬁce—its</nobr> inﬂuence upon the intelligences of other worlds, as well as
          upon <nobr>man—the</nobr> Saviour looked forward when just before His cruciﬁxion He said: “Now is the judgment
          of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will
          draw all men unto me.”</p>
      <p>The act of Christ in dying for the salvation of man would not only make heaven accessible to men, but before
          all the universe it would justify God and His Son in their dealing with the rebellion of Satan. It would
          establish the perpetuity of the law of God, and would reveal the nature and the results of sin.</p>
      <p>From the ﬁrst the great controversy had been upon the law of God. Satan had sought to prove that God was
          unjust, that His law was faulty, and that the good of the universe required it to be changed. In attacking the
          law he aimed to overthrow the authority of its Author. In the controversy it was to be shown whether the
          divine statutes were defective and subject to change, or perfect and immutable....</p>
      <p>Heaven marked the insult and mockery that He received, and knew that it was at Satan’s instigation.... They
          watched the battle between light and darkness as it waxed stronger. And</p>
      <p>as Christ in His expiring agony upon the cross cried out, “It is ﬁnished” (John 19:30), a shout of triumph rang
          through every world and through heaven itself.... Satan had revealed</p>
      <p>his true character.... The very fact that Christ bore the penalty of man’s transgression is a</p>
      <p>mighty argument to all created intelligences that the law is changeless; that God is righteous, merciful, and
          <nobr>self-denying;</nobr> and that inﬁnite justice and mercy unite in the administration of His
          <nobr>government.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, <nobr>68-70.</nobr></p>
