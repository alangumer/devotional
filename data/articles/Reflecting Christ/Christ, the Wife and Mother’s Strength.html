    <h1>Christ, the Wife and Mother’s Strength</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. Proverbs
          31:28.</strong></p>
      <p>It is true that the wheels of domestic machinery will not always run smoothly; there is much to try the
          patience and tax the strength. But while mothers are not responsible for circumstances over which they have no
          control, it is useless to deny that circumstances make a great difference with mothers in their lifework. But
          their condemnation is when circumstances are allowed to rule, and to subvert their principle, when they grow
          tired and unfaithful to their high trust, and neglect their known duty.</p>
      <p>The wife and mother who nobly overcomes difﬁculties, under which others sink for want of patience and fortitude
          to persevere, not only becomes strong herself in doing her duty, but her experience in overcoming temptations
          and obstacles qualiﬁes her to be an efﬁcient help to others, both by words and example. Many who do well under
          favorable circumstances seem to undergo a transformation of character under adversity and trial; they
          deteriorate in proportion to their troubles. God never designed that we should be the sport of
          circumstances....</p>
      <p>[The true wife and mother] will perform her duties with dignity and cheerfulness, not considering that it is
          degrading to do with her own hands whatever is necessary for her to do in a <nobr>well-ordered</nobr>
          household. If she looks to God for her strength and comfort, and in His wisdom and fear seeks to do her daily
          duty, she will bind her husband to her heart, and see her children coming to maturity, honorable men and
          women, having moral stamina to follow the example of their mother.</p>
      <p>There is no chance work in this life; the harvest will determine the character of the seed that has been
          sown....</p>
      <p>Mothers, you are developing character. Your compassionate Redeemer is watching you in love and sympathy, ready
          to hear your prayers, and render you the assistance which you need in your lifework. Love, joy, peace,
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, faith, and charity are the elements of the Christlike character.
          These precious graces are the fruits of the Spirit. They are the Christian’s crown and shield. The highest
          daydreaming and most exalted aspirations can aim at nothing higher. Nothing can give more perfect content and
          satisfaction.</p>
      <p>These heavenly attainments are not dependent upon circumstances, nor the will or imperfect judgment of man. The
          precious Saviour, who understands our heart struggles and the weaknesses of our natures, pities, and forgives
          us our errors, and bestows upon us the graces which we earnestly <nobr>desire.—The</nobr> Health Reformer,
          August, 1877.</p>
