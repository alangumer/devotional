    <h1>The Knowledge of God Is Vital</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the
          rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me.
          Jeremiah 9:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>Having received the faith of the gospel, ... the believer is to add to his character virtue, and thus cleanse
          the heart and prepare the mind for the reception of the knowledge of God. This knowledge is the foundation of
          all true education and of all true service. It is the only real safeguard against temptation; and it is this
          alone that can make one like God in character. Through the knowledge of God and of His Son, Jesus Christ, are
          given to the believer “all things that pertain unto life and godliness.” No good gift is withheld from him who
          sincerely desires to obtain the righteousness of God.</p>
      <p>“This is life eternal,” Christ said, “that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou
          hast sent” (John 17:3). And the prophet Jeremiah declared: ...</p>
      <p>“I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I
          delight, saith the Lord” (Jeremiah 9:24). Scarcely can the human mind comprehend the breadth and depth and
          height of the spiritual attainments of him who gains this knowledge.</p>
      <p>None need fail of attaining, in his sphere, to perfection of Christian character. By the sacriﬁce of Christ,
          provision has been made for the believer to receive all things that pertain to life and godliness. God calls
          upon us to reach the standard of perfection and places before us the example of Christ’s character. In His
          humanity, perfected by a life of constant resistance of evil, the Saviour showed that through cooperation with
          Divinity, human beings may in this life attain to perfection of character. This is God’s assurance to us that
          we, too, may obtain complete victory.</p>
      <p>Before the believer is held out the wonderful possibility of being like Christ, obedient to all the principles
          of the law.... The holiness that God’s Word declares he must have before</p>
      <p>he can be saved is the result of the working of divine grace as he bows in submission to the discipline and
          restraining inﬂuences of the Spirit of truth. Man’s obedience can be made perfect only by the incense of
          Christ’s righteousness, which ﬁlls with divine fragrance every act of obedience.</p>
      <p>The part of the Christian is to persevere in overcoming every fault. Constantly he is to pray to the Saviour to
          heal the disorders of his <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> soul. He has not the wisdom or the strength to overcome; these
          belong to the Lord, and He bestows them on those who in humiliation and contrition seek Him for
          <nobr>help.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>530-532.</nobr></p>
