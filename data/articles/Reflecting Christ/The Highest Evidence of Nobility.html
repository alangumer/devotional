    <h1>The Highest Evidence of Nobility</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a
          city. Proverbs 16:32.</strong></p>
      <p>He [who is slow to anger] has conquered <nobr>self—the</nobr> strongest foe man has to meet.</p>
      <p>The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian is <nobr>self-control.</nobr> He who can stand unmoved amid a
          storm of abuse is one of God’s heroes.</p>
      <p>To rule the spirit is to keep self under discipline; to resist evil; to regulate every word and deed by God’s
          great standard of righteousness. He who has learned to rule his spirit will rise above the slights, the
          rebuffs, the annoyances, to which we are daily exposed, and these will cease to cast a gloom over his
          spirit.</p>
      <p>It is God’s purpose that the kingly power of sanctiﬁed reason, controlled by divine grace, shall bear sway in
          the lives of human beings. He who rules his spirit is in possession of this power.</p>
      <p>In childhood and youth the character is most impressible. The power of <nobr>self-control</nobr> should then be
          acquired. By the ﬁreside and at the family board inﬂuences are exerted the results of which are as enduring as
          eternity. More than any natural endowment, the habits established in early years will decide whether a man
          shall be victorious or vanquished in the battle of life.</p>
      <p>In the use of language, there is, perhaps, no error that old and young are more ready to pass over lightly in
          themselves than hasty, impatient speech. They think it is a sufﬁcient excuse to plead, “I was off my guard,
          and did not really mean what I said.” But God’s Word does not treat it lightly....</p>
      <p>The largest share of life’s annoyances, its heartaches, its irritations, is due to uncontrolled temper. In one
          moment, by hasty, passionate, careless words, may be wrought evil that a whole lifetime’s repentance cannot
          undo. Oh, the hearts that are broken, the friends estranged, the lives wrecked, by the harsh, hasty words of
          those who might have brought help and healing!</p>
      <p>Overwork sometimes causes a loss of <nobr>self-control.</nobr> But the Lord never compels hurried, complicated
          movements. Many gather to themselves burdens that the merciful heavenly Father did not place on them. Duties
          He never designed them to perform chase one another wildly. God desires us to realize that we do not glorify
          His name when we take so many burdens that we are overtaxed and, becoming <nobr>heart-weary</nobr> and
          <nobr>brain-weary,</nobr> chafe and fret and scold. We are to bear only the responsibilities that the Lord
          gives us, trusting in Him, and thus keeping our hearts pure and sweet and <nobr>sympathetic.—The</nobr> Review
          and Herald, October 31, 1907.</p>
