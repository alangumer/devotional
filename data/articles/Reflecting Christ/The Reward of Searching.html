    <h1>The Reward of Searching</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest for her as
          silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and ﬁnd
          the knowledge of God. Proverbs <nobr>2:3-5.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>There must be earnest study and close investigation. Sharp, clear perceptions of truth will never be the reward
          of indolence. No earthly blessing can be obtained without earnest, patient, persevering effort. If men attain
          success in business, they must have a will to do and a faith to look for results. And we cannot expect to gain
          spiritual knowledge without earnest toil. Those who desire to ﬁnd the treasures of truth must dig for them as
          the miner digs for the treasure hidden in the earth. No halfhearted, indifferent work will avail. It is
          essential for old and young, not only to read God’s Word, but to study it with wholehearted earnestness,
          praying and searching for truth as for hidden treasure. Those who do this will be rewarded, for Christ will
          quicken the understanding....</p>
      <p>No one can search the Scriptures in the spirit of Christ without being rewarded. When man is willing to be
          instructed as a little child, when he submits wholly to God, he will ﬁnd the truth in His Word. If men would
          be obedient, they would understand the plan of God’s government. The heavenly world would open its chambers of
          grace and glory for exploration. Human beings would be altogether different from what they now are, for by
          exploring the mines of truth men would be ennobled. The mystery of redemption, the incarnation of Christ, His
          atoning sacriﬁce, would not be as they are now, vague in our minds. They would be not only better understood,
          but altogether more highly appreciated.</p>
      <p>In His prayer to the Father, Christ gave to the world a lesson which should be graven on mind and soul. “This
          is life eternal,” He said, “that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
          sent” (John 17:3). This is true education. It imparts power. The experimental knowledge of God and of Jesus
          Christ whom He has sent transforms man into the image of God. It gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing
          every impulse and passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher powers of the mind. It makes its
          possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings him into communion with the mind of the Inﬁnite, and
          opens to him the rich treasures of the universe.</p>
      <p>This is the knowledge which is obtained by searching the Word of God. And this treasure may be found by every
          soul who will give all to obtain <nobr>it.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, <nobr>111-114.</nobr></p>
