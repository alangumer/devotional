    <h1>Character is Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this
          grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ has given us no assurance that to attain perfection of character is an easy matter. A noble,
          <nobr>all-round</nobr> character is not inherited. It does not come to us by accident. A noble character is
          earned by individual effort through the merits and grace and Christ. God gives the talents, the powers of the
          mind; we form the character. It is formed by hard, stern battles with self. Conﬂict after conﬂict must be
          waged against hereditary tendencies. We shall have to criticize ourselves closely, and allow not one
          unfavorable trait to remain uncorrected....</p>
      <p>A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we can take from this world to
          the next. Those who are under the instruction of Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with
          them to the heavenly mansions....</p>
      <p>The heavenly intelligences will work with the human agent who seeks with determined faith that perfection of
          character which will reach out to perfection in action. To everyone engaged in this work Christ says, I am at
          your right hand to help you.</p>
      <p>As the will of man cooperates with the will of God, it becomes omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His
          command may be accomplished in His strength. All His biddings are <nobr>enablings.—Christ’s</nobr> Object
          Lessons, <nobr>331-333.</nobr></p>
      <p>Character is power. The silent witness of a true, unselﬁsh, godly life carries an almost irresistible inﬂuence.
          By revealing in our own life the character of Christ we cooperate with Him in the work of saving souls. It is
          only by revealing in our life His character that we can cooperate with Him. And the wider the sphere of our
          inﬂuence, the more good we may do. When those who profess to serve God follow Christ’s example, practicing the
          principles of the law in their daily life; when every act bears witness that they love God supremely and their
          neighbor as themselves, then will the church have power to move the world....</p>
      <p>We know not what results a day, an hour, or a moment may determine, and never should we begin the day without
          committing our ways to our heavenly Father.... When</p>
      <p>unconsciously we are in danger of exerting a wrong inﬂuence, the angels will be by our side, prompting us to a
          better course, choosing our words for us, and inﬂuencing our actions. Thus our inﬂuence may be a silent,
          unconscious, but mighty power in drawing others to Christ and the heavenly <nobr>world.—Christ’s</nobr> Object
          Lessons, <nobr>340-342.</nobr></p>
