    <h1>The World Needs Health Principles</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. Mark 16:18.</strong></p>
      <p>In teaching health principles, keep before the mind the great object of <nobr>reform—that</nobr> its purpose is
          to secure the highest development of body and mind and soul. Show that the laws of nature, being the laws of
          God, are designed for our good; that obedience to them promotes happiness in this life, and aids in the
          preparation for the life to come.</p>
      <p>Lead the people to study the manifestation of God’s love and wisdom in the works of nature. Lead them to study
          that marvelous organism, the human system, and the laws by which it is governed. Those who perceive the
          evidences of God’s love, who understand something of the wisdom and beneﬁcence of His laws, and the results of
          obedience, will come to regard their duties and obligations from an altogether different point of view.
          Instead of looking upon an observance of the laws of health as a matter of sacriﬁce or
          <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> they will regard it, as it really is, as an inestimable blessing.</p>
      <p>Every gospel worker should feel that the giving of instruction in the principles of healthful living is a part
          of his appointed work. Of this work there is great need, and the world is open for it.</p>
      <p>Everywhere there is a tendency to substitute the work of organizations for individual effort. Human wisdom
          tends to consolidation, to centralization, to the building up of great churches and institutions. Multitudes
          leave to institutions and organizations the work of benevolence; they excuse themselves from contact with the
          world, and their hearts grow cold. They become <nobr>self-absorbed</nobr> and unimpressible. Love for God and
          man dies out of the soul.</p>
      <p>Christ commits to His followers an individual <nobr>work—a</nobr> work that cannot be done by proxy. Ministry
          to the sick and the poor, the giving of the gospel to the lost, is not to be left to committees or organized
          charities. Individual responsibility, individual effort, personal sacriﬁce, is the requirement of the
          gospel.</p>
      <p>“Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,” is Christ’s command, “that my house may be
          ﬁlled” (Luke 14:23). He brings men into touch with those whom they seek to beneﬁt. “Bring the poor that are
          cast out to thy house,” He says. “When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him” (Isaiah 58:7). “They shall
          lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover” (Mark 16:18). Through direct contact, through personal
          ministry, the blessings of the gospel are to be <nobr>communicated.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing,
          <nobr>146-148.</nobr></p>
