    <h1>Christ Brought Spiritual and Physical Healing</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his beneﬁts: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who
          healeth all thy diseases. Psalm 103:2, 3.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ bade the paralytic arise and walk, “that ye may know,” He said, “that the Son of man hath power on earth
          to forgive sins.”</p>
      <p>The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the body. The spiritual healing was followed by
          physical restoration. This lesson should not be overlooked. There are today thousands suffering from physical
          disease, who, like the paralytic, are longing for the message, “Thy sins are forgiven.” The burden of sin,
          with its unrest and unsatisﬁed desires, is the foundation of their maladies. They can ﬁnd no relief until they
          come to the Healer of the soul. The peace which He alone can give would impart vigor to the mind, and health
          to the body.</p>
      <p>Jesus came to “destroy the works of the devil.” “In him was life,” and He says, “I am come that they might have
          life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” He is “a quickening spirit.” And He still has the same
          <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power as when on earth He healed the sick and spoke forgiveness to the sinner. He
          “forgiveth all thine iniquities,” He “healeth all thy diseases.”</p>
      <p>The effect produced upon the people by the healing of the paralytic was as if heaven has opened, and revealed
          the glories of the better world. As the man who had been cured passed through the multitude, blessing God at
          every step, and bearing his burden as if it were a feather’s weight, the people fell back to give him room,
          and with <nobr>awe-stricken</nobr> faces gazed upon him, whispering softly among themselves, “We have seen
          strange things today.” ...</p>
      <p>In the home of the healed paralytic there was great rejoicing.... He stood before them</p>
      <p>in the full vigor of manhood. Those arms that they had seen lifeless were quick to obey his will. The ﬂesh that
          had been shrunken and <nobr>leaden-hued</nobr> was now fresh and ruddy. He walked with a ﬁrm, free step. Joy
          and hope were written in every lineament of his countenance; and an expression of purity and peace had taken
          the place of marks of sin and suffering. Glad thanksgiving went up from that home, and God was gloriﬁed
          through His Son, who had restored hope to the hopeless, and strength to the stricken one. This man and his
          family were ready to lay down their lives for Jesus. No doubt dimmed their faith, no unbelief marred their
          fealty to Him who had brought light into their darkened <nobr>home.—The</nobr> Desire of Ages, 270, 271.</p>
