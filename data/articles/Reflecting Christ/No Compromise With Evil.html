    <h1>No Compromise With Evil</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord,
          and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. Isaiah 55:7.</strong></p>
      <p>When the book of the law was found in the house of the Lord, in the time of ancient Israel, it was read before
          Josiah the king. And he rent his garments, and bade the men in holy ofﬁce to inquire of the Lord for him, and
          for his people; for they had departed from the statutes of the Lord. He called together all the men of Israel,
          and the words of the book were read in the hearing of the congregation. The sin of the rulers and the people
          was pointed out, and the king stood up before them, and confessed his transgression. He manifested his
          repentance, and made a covenant to keep the statutes of the Lord with his whole heart. Josiah did not rest
          until the people did all they could to return from their backsliding, and serve the living God.</p>
      <p>Is not this our work today? Our fathers have transgressed, and we have followed in their footsteps; but God has
          opened the book of the law, and backslidden Israel hear the commandments of the Lord. Their transgression
          stands revealed, and the wrath of God will be upon every soul that does not repent and reform as the light
          shines upon his pathway.</p>
      <p>When Josiah heard the words of warning and condemnation because Israel had trampled upon the precepts of
          Heaven, he humbled himself. He wept before the Lord. He made a thorough work of repentance and reformation,
          and God accepted his efforts. The whole congregation of Israel entered into a solemn covenant to keep the
          commandments of Jehovah. This is our work today. We must repent of the past evil of our doings, and seek God
          with all our hearts. We must believe that God means just what He says, and make no compromise with evil in any
          way. We should greatly humble ourselves before God, and consider any loss preferable to the loss of His
          favor.</p>
      <p>Christ left all to save men from the consequence and penalty of the transgression of the law. The way from the
          manger to Calvary was marked with blood. The Son of God did not deviate from the path of unwavering obedience,
          even to the death of the cross. He endured all the woe of man’s sin.... I beseech you, in the name of Christ,
          that you confess your sins</p>
      <p>and reform your ways, that your name may not be blotted out of the book of life, but may be confessed before
          the Father and before His angels. Jesus is pleading His blood before the Father; and now, while mercy lingers
          and probation is prolonged, seek the approbation of <nobr>Heaven.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 29,
          1911.</p>
