    <h1>Laying Hold of the Mighty One of Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea,
          the work of our hands establish thou it. Psalm 90:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Your children should be taught to control their tempers and to cultivate a loving, Christlike spirit. So direct
          them that they will love the service of God, that they will take more pleasure in going to the house of
          worship than to places of amusement. Teach them that religion is a living principle. Had I been brought up
          with the idea that religion is a mere feeling, my life would have been a useless one. But I never let feeling
          come between Heaven and my soul. Whatever my feelings may be, I will seek God at the commencement of the day,
          at noon, and at night, that I may draw strength from the living Source of power.</p>
      <p>[Mothers,] has ... not [your time] been given you to be spent in beautifying the minds of your children, and
          cultivating loveliness of character? Should it not be spent in laying hold of the Mighty One of heaven, and
          seeking Him for power and wisdom to train your children for a place in His kingdom, to secure for them a life
          that will endure as long as the throne of Jehovah? ...</p>
      <p>Perhaps the mother sits at her work night after night, while her children go to bed without a prayer or a
          <nobr>good-night</nobr> kiss. She does not bind their tender hearts to her own by the cords of love; for she
          is “too busy.” ...</p>
      <p>Some may wonder why it is that we say so much about home religion and the children. It is because of the
          terrible neglect of home duties on the part of so many. As the servants of God, parents, you are responsible
          for the children committed to your care. Many of them are growing up without reverence, growing up careless
          and irreligious, unthankful and unholy.</p>
      <p>If these children had been properly trained and disciplined, if they had been brought up in the nurture and
          admonition of the Lord, heavenly angels would be in your homes. If you were true home missionaries, ... you
          would be ... ﬁtting your children to stand by your side, as efﬁcient workers in the cause of God.</p>
      <p>What an impression it makes upon society to see a family united in the work and service of the Lord. Such a
          family is a powerful discourse in favor of the reality of Christianity. Others see that there is an inﬂuence
          at work in the family that affects the children, and that the God of Abraham is with them. And that which has
          such a powerful inﬂuence on the children is felt beyond the home, and affects other lives. If the homes of
          professed Christians had a right religious mold, they would exert a mighty inﬂuence for good. They would
          indeed be the “light of the <nobr>world.”—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, January 14, 1886.</p>
