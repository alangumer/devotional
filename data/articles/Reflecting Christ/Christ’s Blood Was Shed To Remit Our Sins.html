    <h1>Christ’s Blood Was Shed To Remit Our Sins</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, they are justiﬁed by his grace as a gift,
          through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Romans 3:23, 24, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>We need Jesus every moment. To lose His love from our hearts means much. Yet He Himself says: “I have somewhat
          against thee, because thou hast left thy ﬁrst love.” ...</p>
      <p>The religion of many is very much like an <nobr>icicle—freezingly</nobr> cold. The hearts of not a few are
          still unmelted, unsubdued. They cannot touch the hearts of others, because their own hearts are not surcharged
          with the blessed love that ﬂows from the heart of Christ....</p>
      <p>Genuine religion is based upon a belief in the Scriptures. God’s Word is to be believed without question. No
          part of it is to be cut and carved to ﬁt certain theories. Men are not to exalt human wisdom by sitting in
          judgment upon God’s Word. The Bible was written by holy men of old, as they were moved upon by the Holy
          Spirit; and this Book contains all that we know for certain and all that we can ever hope to learn in regard
          to God and Christ, unless, like Paul, we are taken to the third heaven.... This revelation to the apostle did
          not</p>
      <p>spoil his humility.</p>
      <p>The life of a Christian is a life regulated by the Word of God just as it reads. All the truths of the Old and
          the New Testaments form a complete whole. These truths we are to cherish, believe, and obey. To the true
          disciple, faith in God’s Word is a living, active principle; for “with the heart man believeth unto
          righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:10). By faith man believes
          that he receives the righteousness of Christ.</p>
      <p>Faith, in itself, is an act of the mind. Jesus Himself is the author and the ﬁnisher of our faith. He gave His
          life for us; and His blood speaks in our behalf better things than spoke the blood of Abel, which cried unto
          God against Cain the murderer. Christ’s blood was shed to remit our sins.</p>
      <p>Many commit the error of trying to deﬁne minutely the ﬁne points of distinction between justiﬁcation and
          sanctiﬁcation. Into the deﬁnitions of these two terms they often bring their own ideas and speculations. Why
          try to be more minute than is Inspiration on the vital question of righteousness by
          <nobr>faith?—Manuscript</nobr> 21, 1891.</p>
      <p>Those who are united with Christ through the daily, hourly exercise of the faith which works by love and
          puriﬁes the soul receive the forgiveness of their sins, and are sanctiﬁed unto eternal
          <nobr>life.—Manuscript</nobr> 12a, 1901.</p>
