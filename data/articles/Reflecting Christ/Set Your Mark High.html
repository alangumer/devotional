    <h1>Set Your Mark High</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Philippians
          3:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Let no one say, I cannot remedy my defects of character. If you come to this decision, you will certainly fail
          of obtaining everlasting life. The impossibility lies in your own will. If you will not, then you cannot
          overcome. The real difﬁculty arises from the corruption of an unsanctiﬁed heart, and an unwillingness to
          submit to the control of God.</p>
      <p>Many whom God has qualiﬁed to do excellent work accomplish very little, because they attempt little. Thousands
          pass through life as if they had no deﬁnite object for which to live, no standard to reach. Such will obtain a
          reward proportionate to their works.</p>
      <p>Remember that you will never reach a higher standard than you yourself set. Then set your mark high, and step
          by step, even though it be by painful effort, by <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and sacriﬁce, ascend the whole
          length of the ladder of progress. Let nothing hinder you. Fate has not woven its meshes about any human being
          so ﬁrmly that he need remain helpless and in uncertainty. Opposing circumstances should create a ﬁrm
          determination to overcome them. The breaking down of one barrier will give greater ability and courage to go
          forward. Press with determination in the right direction, and circumstances will be your helpers, not your
          hindrances.</p>
      <p>Be ambitious, for the Master’s glory, to cultivate every grace of character. In every phase of your character
          building you are to please God. This you may do; for Enoch pleased Him though living in a degenerate age. And
          there are Enochs in this our day.</p>
      <p>Stand like Daniel, that faithful statesman, a man whom no temptation could corrupt. Do not disappoint Him who
          so loved you that He gave His own life to cancel your sins. He says, “Without Me ye can do nothing” (John
          15:5). Remember this. If you have made mistakes, you certainly gain a victory if you see these mistakes and
          regard them as beacons of warning. Thus you turn defeat into victory, disappointing the enemy and honoring
          your <nobr>Redeemer.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, 331, 332.</p>
      <p>Your time, your inﬂuence, your capabilities, your <nobr>skill—all</nobr> must be accounted for to Him who gives
          all.... Persevere in the work that you have begun, until you gain victory after</p>
      <p>victory. Educate yourselves for a purpose. Keep in view the highest standard, that you may accomplish greater
          and still greater good, thus reﬂecting the glory of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Youth’s Instructor, Jan. 25,
          1910.</p>
