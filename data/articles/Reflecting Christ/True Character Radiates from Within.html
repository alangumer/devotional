      <p><strong>Ye are the light of the world. Matthew 5:14.</strong></p>
      <p>“Ye are the light of the world.” The Jews thought to conﬁne the beneﬁts of salvation to their own nation; but
          Christ showed them that salvation is like the sunshine. It belongs to the whole world. The religion of the
          Bible is not to be conﬁned between the covers of a book, nor within the walls of a church. It is not to be
          brought out occasionally for our own beneﬁt, and then to be carefully laid aside again. It is to sanctify the
          daily life, to manifest itself in every business transaction and in all our social relations.</p>
      <p>True character is not shaped from without, and put on; it radiates from within. If we wish to direct others in
          the path of righteousness, the principles of righteousness must be enshrined in our own hearts. Our profession
          of faith may proclaim the theory of religion, but it is our practical piety that holds forth the word of
          truth. The consistent life, the holy conversation, the unswerving integrity, the active, benevolent spirit,
          the godly <nobr>example—these</nobr> are the mediums through which light is conveyed to the
          <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Desire of Ages, 306, 307.</p>
      <p>As the sun goes forth on its errand of love, dispelling the shades of night and awakening the world to life, so
          the followers of Christ are to go forth on their mission, diffusing the light of heaven upon those who are in
          the darkness of error and sin.</p>
      <p>In the brilliant light of the morning, the towns and villages upon the surrounding hills stood forth clearly,
          making an attractive feature of the scene. Pointing to them, Jesus said, “A city set on a hill cannot be hid.”
          And He added, “Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto
          all that are in the house” (Matthew 5:14, 15, R.V.).</p>
      <p>Most of those who listened to the words of Jesus were peasants and ﬁshermen whose lowly dwellings contained but
          one room, in which the single lamp on its stand shone to all in the house. Even so, said Jesus, “Let your
          light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven”
          (verse 16).</p>
      <p>No other light ever has shone or ever will shine upon fallen man save that which emanates from Christ. Jesus,
          the Saviour, is the only light that can illuminate the darkness of a world lying in sin. Of Christ it is
          written, “In him was life; and the life was the light of men” (John 1:4). It was by receiving of His life that
          His disciples could become light bearers. The life of Christ in the soul, His love revealed in the character,
          would make them the light of the <nobr>world.—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, 39, 40.</p>
