    <h1>Wisdom that Fulﬁlls God’s Purpose</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
          Proverbs 9:10.</strong></p>
      <p>All the varied capabilities that men <nobr>possess—of</nobr> mind and soul and <nobr>body—are</nobr> given them
          by God, to be so employed as to reach the highest possible degree of excellence. But this cannot be a selﬁsh
          and exclusive culture; for the character of God, whose likeness we are to receive, is benevolence and love.
          Every faculty, every attribute, with which the Creator has endowed us is to be employed for His glory and for
          the uplifting of our fellow men. And in this employment is found its purest, noblest, and happiest
          exercise.</p>
      <p>Were this principle given the attention which its importance demands, there would be a radical change in some
          of the current methods of education. Instead of appealing to pride and selﬁsh ambition, kindling a spirit of
          emulation, teachers would endeavor to awaken the love of goodness and truth and <nobr>beauty—to</nobr> arouse
          the desire for excellence. The student would seek the development of God’s gifts in himself, not to excel
          others, but to fulﬁll the purpose of the Creator and to receive His likeness. Instead of being directed to
          merely earthly standards, or being actuated by the desire for <nobr>self-exaltation,</nobr> which in itself
          dwarfs and belittles, the mind would be directed to the Creator, to know Him and to become like Him....</p>
      <p>The great work of life is character building, and a knowledge of God is the foundation of all true
          education.... The law of God is a reﬂection of His character. Hence the psalmist says,</p>
      <p>“All thy commandments are righteousness”; and “through thy precepts I get understanding.” God has revealed
          Himself to us in His Word and in the works of creation. Through the volume of inspiration and the book of
          nature we are to obtain a knowledge of God.</p>
      <p>It is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the subjects upon which it is trained to dwell. If
          occupied with commonplace matters only, it will become dwarfed and enfeebled. If never required to grapple
          with difﬁcult problems, it will after a time almost lose the power of growth. As an educating power the Bible
          is without a rival. In the Word of God the mind ﬁnds subject for the deepest thought, the loftiest aspiration.
          The Bible is the most instructive history that men possess. It came fresh from the fountain of eternal truth,
          and a divine hand has preserved its purity through all the <nobr>ages.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 595,
          596.</p>
