    <h1>Every True Christian to be a Light Bearer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the light of the world. John 9:5.</strong></p>
      <p>God desires us to shine as lights in the world. Darkness has covered the earth, and gross darkness the people;
          and Christ says to His followers, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
          glorify your Father which is in heaven.” We are to give the light of truth to others, ever asking, ever
          receiving, ever imparting, working in all simplicity through the sanctiﬁcation of the Spirit.</p>
      <p>Christ pointed out the position His people should occupy when He said, “Ye are the light of the world.” From
          the members of the church there is to go forth an inﬂuence which shall enlighten others. The
          <nobr>Light-giver</nobr> arranges the lamps so that all in His house (the world) may be enlightened. He has an
          inexhaustible supply of light, and He places those who truly believe in Him where they will shine brighter and
          brighter. Constantly our light is to increase in brightness because we are constantly receiving light from the
          Source of all light. Beholding Christ, we are to become changed into His image, reﬂecting His light to the
          world.</p>
      <p>Each soul united to Christ becomes a light in God’s house. Each is to receive and impart, letting his light
          shine forth in clear, bright rays. We are held responsible by God if we do not let light shine to those who
          are in darkness. God has given each member of His church the work of giving light to the world, and those who
          faithfully act their part in this work will receive an increasing supply of light to impart. By His Spirit the
          Lord will mold and fashion the human agent, quickening his energies, and giving him light wherewith to
          enlighten others.</p>
      <p>Life always shows itself in action. If the heart is living, it will send the lifeblood to every part of the
          body. Those whose hearts are ﬁlled with spiritual life will not need to be urged to reveal this life. The
          divine life will ﬂow forth from them in rich currents of grace. As they pray, and as they speak, God is
          gloriﬁed.</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the Lord’s efﬁciency. He is prepared to advance and to add new territory to His kingdom;
          but His people must do their part in carrying forward this work. “Ask, and it shall be given you” is the
          promise. Our part is to rest on the word with unwavering faith, believing that God will do according to His
          promise. Let faith cut its way through the shadows of the enemy. When a questioning doubt arises, go to
          Christ, and let the soul be encouraged by communion with Him. The redemption He has purchased for us is
          complete. The offering He made was plenteous and without stint. Heaven has a <nobr>never-failing</nobr> supply
          of help for all who need <nobr>help.—The</nobr> Bible Echo, June 11, 1900.</p>
