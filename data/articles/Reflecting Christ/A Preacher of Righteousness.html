    <h1>A Preacher of Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of man. They ate, they drank, they
          married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the ﬂood came, and
          destroyed them all. Luke 17:26, 27, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the nature of sin to spread and increase. Since the ﬁrst sin of Adam, from generation to generation it
          has spread like a contagious disease. While the world was yet in its infancy, sin became fearful in its
          proportions. Hatred of God’s law, and, as the sure result, hatred of all goodness, became universal. God, who
          had created man and given him with an unsparing hand the bounties of His providence, was dishonored by the
          beings He had created, slighted and despised by the recipients of His gifts. But though sinful man forgot His
          benevolent Benefactor, God did not forget the creature He had formed. Not only did He send “rain from heaven,
          and fruitful seasons,” ﬁlling man’s heart with “food and gladness,” but He sent him also messages of warning
          and entreaty. Man’s wickedness was fully set before him, and the result of transgressing the divine law.</p>
      <p>In the days of Noah, the wickedness of the world became so great that God could no longer bear with it.... But
          He pitied the race, and in His love provided a refuge for all who</p>
      <p>would accept it. He gave the message to Noah to be given to the people: “My spirit shall not always strive with
          man.” ... The Spirit of God continued to strive with rebellious man until the time speciﬁed had nearly
          expired, when Noah and his family entered the ark, and the hand of God closed its door. Mercy had stepped from
          the golden throne, no longer to intercede for the guilty sinner.</p>
      <p>All the men of that generation were not in the fullest sense of the term heathen idolaters. Many had a
          knowledge of God and His law; but they not only rejected the message of the faithful preacher of righteousness
          themselves, but used all their inﬂuence to prevent others from being obedient to God. To everyone comes a day
          of trial and trust. That generation had their day of opportunity and privilege while Noah was sounding the
          note of warning of the coming destruction; but they yielded their minds to the control of Satan rather than of
          God, and he deceived them, as he did our ﬁrst parents. He set before them darkness and falsehood in the place
          of light and truth; and they accepted his sophistry and lies, because they were acceptable to them, and in
          harmony with their corrupt lives, while truth that would have saved them was rejected as a delusion. Numbers
          were not on the side of <nobr>right.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, April 1, 1886.</p>
