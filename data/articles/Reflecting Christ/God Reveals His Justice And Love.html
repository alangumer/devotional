    <h1>God Reveals His Justice And Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love is the fulﬁlling of the law. Romans 13:10.</strong></p>
      <p>After the fall of our ﬁrst parents, Christ declared that in order to save man from the penalty of sin, He would
          come to the world to conquer Satan on the enemy’s own battleﬁeld. The controversy that began in heaven was to
          be continued on the earth.</p>
      <p>In this controversy much was to be involved. Vast interests were at stake. Before the inhabitants of the
          heavenly universe were to be answered the questions: “Is God’s law imperfect, in need of amendment or
          abrogation, or is it immutable? Is God’s government in need of change, or is it stable?”</p>
      <p>Before Christ’s ﬁrst advent, the sin of refusing to conform to God’s law had become widespread. Apparently
          Satan’s power was growing; his warfare against heaven was becoming more and more determined. A crisis had been
          reached. With an intense interest God’s movements were watched by the heavenly angels. Would He come forth
          from His place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity? Would He send ﬁre or ﬂood to destroy
          them? All heaven waited the bidding of their Commander to pour out the vials of wrath upon a rebellious world.
          One word from Him, one sign, and the world would have been destroyed. The worlds unfallen would have said,
          “Amen. Thou art righteous, O God, because Thou hast exterminated rebellion.”</p>
      <p>But “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
          perish, but have everlasting life.” God might have sent His Son to condemn, but He sent Him to save. Christ
          came as a Redeemer. No words can describe the effect of this movement on the heavenly angels. With wonder and
          admiration they could only exclaim, “Herein is love!”</p>
      <p>Christ entered upon His mission of mercy, and from the manger to the cross was beset by the enemy. Satan
          contested every inch of ground, exerting his utmost power to overcome Him. Like a tempest temptation after
          temptation beat upon Him. But the more mercilessly they fell, the more ﬁrmly did the Son of God cling to the
          hand of His Father, and press on in the bloodstained path.</p>
      <p>The severity of the conﬂict through which Christ passed was proportionate to the vastness of the interests
          involved in His success or failure.... Satan sought to overthrow</p>
      <p>Christ, in order that he himself might continue to reign in this world as supreme....The</p>
      <p>Father, the Son, and Lucifer have been revealed in their true relation to one another. God has given
          unmistakable evidence of His justice and His <nobr>love.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, August 27, 1902.</p>
