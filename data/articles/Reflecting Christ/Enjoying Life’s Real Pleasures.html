    <h1>Enjoying Life’s Real Pleasures</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I shall ... praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. Psalm 42:11.</strong></p>
      <p>The wise man says that wisdom’s “ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.” Many cherish the
          impression that devotion to God is detrimental to health and to cheerful happiness in the social relations to
          life. But those who walk in the path of wisdom and holiness ﬁnd that “godliness is proﬁtable unto all things,
          having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.” They are alive to the enjoyment of
          life’s real pleasures, while they are not troubled with vain regrets over misspent hours, nor with gloom or
          horror of mind, as the worldling often is when not diverted by some exciting amusement.</p>
      <p>It is true that there are many professing Christians who have diseased imaginations, and do not correctly
          represent the religion of the Bible. They are ever walking under a cloud. They seem to think it a virtue to
          complain of depression of spirits, great trials, and severe conﬂicts. This course is not in accordance with
          the words of the Saviour, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
          your Father which is in heaven.” It is the duty of all to walk in the light, and to cultivate habitual
          cheerfulness of mind, that they may reﬂect light rather than gloom and darkness.</p>
      <p>Godliness does not conﬂict with the laws of health, but is in harmony with them. Had men ever been obedient to
          the law of ten commandments, had they carried out in their lives the principles of these ten precepts, the
          curse of disease that now ﬂoods the world would not be. Men may teach that triﬂing amusements are necessary to
          keep the mind above despondency. The mind may indeed be thus diverted for the time being; but after the
          excitement is over, calm reﬂection comes. Conscience arouses, and makes her voice heard, saying, “This is not
          the way to obtain health or true happiness.”</p>
      <p>There are many amusements that excite the mind, but depression is sure to follow. Other modes of recreation are
          innocent and healthful; but useful labor that affords physical exercise will often have a more beneﬁcial
          inﬂuence upon the mind, while at the same time it will strengthen the muscles, improve the circulation, and
          prove a powerful agent in the recovery of health.</p>
      <p>“What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? ...</p>
      <p>The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their <nobr>troubles.”—The</nobr> Signs
          of the Times, October 23, 1884.</p>
