    <h1>God’s People Protected</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day,
          nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. Psalm
          <nobr>121:5-7.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship
          the beast and his image and receive his mark (Revelation 14:9,</p>
      <p><span class="ft8">10)</span><span class="ft17">will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was about to
          deliver Israel were similar in character to those more terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon
          the world just before the ﬁnal deliverance of God’s people....</span></p>
      <p>These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the
          most awful scourges that have ever been known to mortals. All the judgments upon men, prior to the close of
          probation, have been mingled with mercy. The pleading blood of Christ has shielded the sinner from receiving
          the full measure of his guilt; but in the ﬁnal judgment, wrath is poured out unmixed with mercy....</p>
      <p>The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while persecuted and distressed, while they endure
          privation and suffer for want of food, they will not be left to perish. That God who cared for Elijah will not
          pass by one of His <nobr>self-sacriﬁcing</nobr> children. He who numbers the hairs of their head will care for
          them, and in time of famine they shall be satisﬁed. While the wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence,
          angels will shield the righteous and supply their wants. To him that “walketh righteously” is the promise;
          “Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure” (Isaiah 33:15, 16). “When the poor and needy seek water,
          and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will
          not forsake them” (chap. 41:17).</p>
      <p>“Although the ﬁg tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines,”... yet shall they that fear Him
          “rejoice in the Lord” and joy in the God of their salvation (Habakkuk 3:17, 18)....</p>
      <p>“The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he
          shall preserve thy soul” (Psalm 121:6, 7). “He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the
          noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust.... Because
          thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall
          thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling” (Psalm <nobr>91:3-10).—The</nobr> Great Controversy,
          <nobr>627-630.</nobr></p>
      <p>Those who receive the seal of the living God and are protected in the time of trouble must reﬂect the image of
          Jesus <nobr>fully.—Early</nobr> Writings, 71.</p>
