    <h1>Cheerfulness in the Home Promotes Happiness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. Proverbs
          16:24.</strong></p>
      <p>The mother should cultivate a cheerful, contented, happy disposition. Every effort in this direction will be
          abundantly repaid in both the physical <nobr>well-being</nobr> and the moral character of her children. A
          cheerful spirit will promote the happiness of her family and in a very great degree improve her own
          health.</p>
      <p>Let the husband aid his wife by his sympathy and unfailing affection. If he wishes to keep her fresh and
          gladsome, so that she will be as sunshine in the home, let him help her bear her burdens. His kindness and
          loving courtesy will be to her a precious encouragement, and the happiness he imparts will bring joy and peace
          to his own heart....</p>
      <p>Great is the honor and the responsibility placed upon fathers and mothers, in that they are to stand in the
          place of God to their children. Their character, their daily life, their methods of training, will interpret
          His words to the little ones. Their inﬂuence will win or repel the child’s conﬁdence in the Lord’s
          assurances.</p>
      <p>Happy are the parents whose lives are a true reﬂection of the divine, so that the promises and commands of God
          awaken in the child gratitude and reverence; the parents whose tenderness and justice and
          <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> interpret to the child the love and justice and <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> of
          God; and who, by teaching the child to love and trust and obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and
          obey his Father in heaven. Parents who impart to a child such a gift have endowed him with a treasure more
          precious than the wealth of all the <nobr>ages—a</nobr> treasure as enduring as eternity.</p>
      <p>In the children committed to her care, every mother has a sacred charge from God. “Take this son, this
          daughter,” He says; “train it for Me; give it a character ‘polished after the similitude of a palace,’ that it
          may shine in the courts of the Lord forever.” ...</p>
      <p>There is a God above, and the light and glory from His throne rests upon the faithful mother as she tries to
          educate her children to resist the inﬂuence of evil. No other work can equal hers in importance....</p>
      <p>The mother who appreciates this will regard her opportunities as priceless. Earnestly will she seek, in her own
          character and by her methods of training, to present before her children the highest ideal.... Diligently she
          will study His Word. She will keep her eyes</p>
      <p>ﬁxed upon Christ, that her own daily experience, in the lowly round of care and duty, may be a true reﬂection
          of the one true <nobr>Life.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, <nobr>374-378.</nobr></p>
