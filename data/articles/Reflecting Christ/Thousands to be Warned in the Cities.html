    <h1>Thousands to be Warned in the Cities</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all
          ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. Acts 4:31.</strong></p>
      <p>When I think of the cities in which so little work has been done, in which there are so many thousands to be
          warned of the soon coming of the Saviour, I feel an intensity of desire to see men and women going forth to
          the work in the power of the Spirit, ﬁlled with Christ’s love for perishing souls.</p>
      <p>The heathen in the cities at our doors have been strangely neglected. Organized effort should be made to save
          them. We are now to work to convert ... those who are living within the shadow of our doors. A new song is to
          be put in their mouths, and they are to go forth to impart to others now in darkness the light of the third
          angel’s message.</p>
      <p>We all need to be wide awake, that, as the way opens, we may advance the work in the large cities. We are far
          behind in following the light given us to enter the cities and erect memorials for God. Step by step we are to
          lead souls into the full light of truth. Many are longing for spiritual food. We are to continue working until
          a church is organized and a humble house of worship built. I am greatly encouraged to believe that many
          persons not of our faith will help considerably by their means. The light given me is that in many places,
          especially in the great cities ..., help will be given by such persons....</p>
      <p>Those who undertake to work for God in our cities must go forward in faith, doing their very best. As they
          watch and work and pray, God will hear and answer their petitions. They will obtain an experience that will be
          invaluable to them in their afterwork. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
          seen.”</p>
      <p>My mind is deeply stirred. In every city there is work to be done. Laborers are to go into our large
          cities....</p>
      <p>We need to feel the vivifying inﬂuence of the Holy Spirit as the disciples felt it on the day of Pentecost. Of
          their experience at that time we read: “And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
          assembled together; and they were all ﬁlled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the Word of God with boldness.
          And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought
          of the things which he possessed was his own.” Selﬁshness was expelled from the heart. “And with great power
          gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them
          <nobr>all.”—Paciﬁc</nobr> Union Recorder, October 23, 1902.</p>
