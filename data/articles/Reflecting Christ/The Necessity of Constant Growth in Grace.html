    <h1>The Necessity of Constant Growth in Grace</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.
          2 Peter 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The work of transformation from unholiness to holiness is a continuous one. Day by day God labors for man’s
          sanctiﬁcation, and man is to cooperate with Him, putting forth persevering efforts in the cultivation of right
          habits. He is to add grace to grace; and as he thus works on the plan of addition, God works for him on the
          plan of multiplication. Our Saviour is always ready to hear and answer the prayer of the contrite heart, and
          grace and peace are multiplied to His faithful ones. Gladly He grants them the blessings they need in their
          struggle against the evils that beset them.</p>
      <p>There are those who attempt to ascend the ladder of Christian progress; but as they advance they begin to put
          their trust in the power of man, and soon lose sight of Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith. The
          result is <nobr>failure—the</nobr> loss of all that has been gained. Sad indeed is the condition of those who,
          becoming weary of the way, allow the enemy of souls to rob them of the Christian graces that have been
          developing in their hearts and lives. “He that lacketh these things,” declares the apostle, “is blind, and
          cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.”</p>
      <p>The apostle Peter had had a long experience in the things of God. His faith in God’s power to save had
          strengthened with the years, until he had proved beyond question that there is no possibility of failure
          before the one who, advancing by faith, ascends round by round, ever upward and onward, to the topmost round
          of the ladder that reaches even to the portals of heaven.</p>
      <p>For many years Peter had been urging upon the believers the necessity of a constant growth in grace and in a
          knowledge of the truth; and now, knowing that soon he would be called to suffer martyrdom for his faith, he
          once more drew attention to the precious privileges within the reach of every believer. In the full assurance
          of his faith the aged disciple exhorted his brethren to steadfastness of purpose in the Christian life. “Give
          diligence,” he pleaded, “to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never
          fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
          Saviour Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p>Precious assurance! Glorious is the hope before the believer as he advances by faith toward the heights of
          Christian <nobr>perfection!—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 532, 533.</p>
