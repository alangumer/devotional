    <h1>The Importance of Strict Temperance</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed art thou, O land, when ... thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
          drunkenness! Ecclesiastes 10:17.</strong></p>
      <p>The lesson from the experience of these [Hebrew] youth is one which we would all do well to ponder. Our danger
          is not from scarcity, but from abundance. We are constantly tempted to excess. But those who would preserve
          their powers unimpaired for the service of God must observe strict temperance in the use of all His bounties,
          as well as total abstinence from every injurious or debasing indulgence.</p>
      <p>Right physical habits promote mental superiority. Intellectual power, physical strength, and longevity depend
          upon immutable laws. There is no <nobr>happen-so,</nobr> no chance, about this matter. Heaven will not
          interfere to preserve men from the consequences of the violation of nature’s laws. There is much of truth in
          the adage that every man is the architect of his own fortune. While parents are responsible for the stamp of
          character, as well as for the education and training which they give their sons and daughters, it is still
          true that our position and usefulness in the world depend, to a great degree, upon our own course of
          action.</p>
      <p>Let old and young remember that for every violation of the laws of life, nature will utter her protest. The
          penalty will fall upon the mental as well as the physical powers. And it does not end with the guilty triﬂer.
          The effects of his misdemeanors are seen in his offspring, and thus hereditary evils are passed down, even to
          the third or fourth generation....</p>
      <p>We are suffering for the wrong habits of our fathers, and yet how many take a course every way worse than
          theirs! Every year millions of gallons of intoxicating liquors are drunk, and millions of dollars are spent
          for tobacco. Opium, tea, coffee, tobacco, and intoxicating liquors are rapidly extinguishing the spark of
          vitality still left in the race....</p>
      <p>The use of intoxicating liquor dethrones reason, and hardens the heart against every pure and holy
          inﬂuence....</p>
      <p>There is need now of men like <nobr>Daniel—men</nobr> who have the <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and the courage to
          be radical temperance reformers. Let every Christian see that his example and his inﬂuence are on the side of
          reform. Let ministers of the gospel be faithful in instructing and warning the people. And let all remember
          that our happiness in two worlds depends upon the right improvement of <nobr>one.—The</nobr> Signs of the
          Times, February 11, 1886.</p>
