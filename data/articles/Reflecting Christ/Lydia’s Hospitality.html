    <h1>Lydia’s Hospitality</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, ... heard us.... And when she</strong></p>
      <p>was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come
          into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. Acts 16:14, 15.</p>
      <p>“On the Sabbath,” Luke [declared], “we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made;
          and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of
          purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened.” Lydia received
          the truth gladly. She and her household were converted and baptized, and she entreated the apostles to make
          her house their <nobr>home.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 212.</p>
      <p>God’s Spirit can only enlighten the understanding of those who are willing to be enlightened. We read that God
          opened the ears of Lydia, so that she attended to the message spoken by Paul. To declare the whole counsel of
          God and all that was essential for Lydia to <nobr>receive—this</nobr> was the part Paul was to act in her
          conversion; and then the God of all grace exercised His power, leading the soul in the right way. God and the
          human agent cooperated, and the work was wholly <nobr>successful.—The</nobr> S.D.A. Bible Commentary
          6:1062.</p>
      <p>[The authorities] visited the prison, apologized to the apostles for their injustice and cruelty, and
          themselves conducted them out of the prison, and entreated them to depart out of the city.... The apostles
          would not urge their presence where it was not desired. They</p>
      <p>complied with the request of the magistrates, but did not hasten their departure.... They</p>
      <p>went rejoicing from the prison to the house of Lydia, where they met the new converts to the faith of Christ,
          and related all the wonderful dealings of God with them. They related their night’s experience, and the
          conversion of the keeper of the prison, and of the prisoners.</p>
      <p>The apostles viewed their labors in Philippi as not in vain. They there met much opposition and persecution;
          but the intervention of Providence in their behalf, the conversion of the jailer and all his house, more than
          atoned for the disgrace and suffering they had endured. The Philippians saw represented in the deportment and
          presence of mind of the apostles the spirit of the religion of Jesus Christ....</p>
      <p>The news of their unjust imprisonment and miraculous deliverance was noised about through all that region, and
          brought the apostles and their ministry before the notice of a large number who would not otherwise have been
          reached. Christianity was placed upon a high plane, and the converts to the faith were greatly
          <nobr>strengthened.—The</nobr> Spirit of Prophecy 3:385, 386.</p>
