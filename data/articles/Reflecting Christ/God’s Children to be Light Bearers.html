    <h1>God’s Children to be Light Bearers</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is
          in heaven. Matthew 5:16.</strong></p>
      <p>God never designed that one man’s mind or judgment should be a controlling power. Whenever He has had a special
          work to be done, He has always had men ready to meet the demand. In every age, when the divine voice has
          asked, Who will go for us? the response has come, “Here am I, send me.” In ancient times the Lord had
          connected with His work men of varied talents. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses with his meekness and wisdom, and
          Joshua with his varied capabilities were all enlisted in God’s service. The music of Miriam, the courage and
          piety of Deborah, the ﬁlial affection of Ruth, the obedience and faithfulness of <nobr>Samuel—all</nobr> were
          needed. Elijah with his stern traits of character, God used at His appointed time to execute judgment upon
          Jezebel.</p>
      <p>God will not give His Spirit to those who make no use of the heavenly gift. But those who are drawn out of and
          away from themselves, seeking to enlighten, encourage, and bless others, will have increased ability and
          energy to expend. The more light they give, the more they receive.— The Southern Watchman, 31, 1905.</p>
      <p>In all ages the “Spirit of Christ which was in them” (1 Peter 1:11) has made God’s true children the light of
          the people of their generation. Joseph was a light bearer in Egypt. In his purity and benevolence and ﬁlial
          love he represented Christ in the midst of a nation of idolaters. While the Israelites were on their way from
          Egypt to the Promised Land, the truehearted among them were a light to the surrounding nations. Through them
          God was revealed to the world. From Daniel and his companions in Babylon, and from Mordecai in Persia, bright
          beams of light shone out amid the darkness of the kingly courts.</p>
      <p>In like manner the disciples of Christ are set as light bearers on the way to heaven; through them the Father’s
          mercy and goodness are made manifest to a world enshrouded in the darkness of misapprehension of God. By
          seeing their good works, others are led to glorify the Father who is above; for it is made manifest that there
          is a God on the throne of the universe whose character is worthy of praise and imitation. The divine love
          glowing in the heart, the Christlike harmony manifested in the life, are as a glimpse of heaven granted to men
          of the world, that they may appreciate its excellence.</p>
      <p>It is thus that men are led to believe “the love that God hath to us” (1 John 4:16). Thus hearts once sinful
          and corrupt are puriﬁed and transformed, to be presented “faultless before the presence of His glory with
          exceeding joy” (Jude <nobr>24).—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, 41, 42.</p>
