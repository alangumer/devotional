    <h1>Reﬂecting Light from the Sun of Righteousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them
          that obey him. Acts 5:32.</strong></p>
      <p>God wants every member of the church to stand faithfully at his post of duty, to realize his responsibility,
          and create a heavenly atmosphere about his soul by continually gathering the bright rays of the Sun of
          Righteousness to shed upon the pathway of those about him....</p>
      <p>We are to be representatives of Christ, as Christ was a representative of the Father. We want to be able to
          attract souls to Jesus, to point them to the Lamb of Calvary, who taketh away the sin of the world. Christ
          does not clothe sin with His righteousness, but He removes the sin, and in its place He imputes His own
          righteousness. When your sin is cleansed, the righteousness of Christ goes before you, and the glory of the
          Lord is your rearward. Your inﬂuence will then be decidedly on the side of Christ; for instead of making self
          a center, you will make Christ a center, and will feel that you are a guardian of sacred trusts.</p>
      <p>When you remember that Christ has paid the price of His own blood for your redemption and for the redemption of
          others, you will be moved to catch the bright rays of His righteousness, that you may shed them upon the
          pathway of those around you. You are not to look to the future, thinking that at some distant day you are to
          be made holy; it is now that you are to be sanctiﬁed through the truth.... Jesus says, “But ye shall
          receive</p>
      <p>power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me...</p>
      <p>unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Acts 1:8). We are to receive the Holy Ghost.... The</p>
      <p>Holy Spirit is the Comforter that Christ promised to His disciples to bring all things to their remembrance
          whatsoever He had said unto them.</p>
      <p>Then let us cease to look to ourselves, but look to Him from whom all virtue comes. No one can make himself
          better, but we are to come to Jesus as we are, earnestly desiring to be cleansed from every spot and stain of
          sin, and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.... By living</p>
      <p>faith we must lay hold of His promise, for He has said, “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white
          as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”</p>
      <p>We are to be witnesses for Christ, reﬂecting upon others the light which the Lord permits to shine upon us. We
          are to be as faithful soldiers marching under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel.... The Captain of
          our salvation knows the plan of the battle, and we</p>
      <p>shall come off more than conquerors through <nobr>Him.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, April 4, 1892.</p>
