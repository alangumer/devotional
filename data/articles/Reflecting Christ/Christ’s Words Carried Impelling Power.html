    <h1>Christ’s Words Carried Impelling Power</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. John 1:29. “Jesus, walking by the sea
          of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew</strong></p>
      <p>his brother.... And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you ﬁshers of men. And</p>
      <p>they straightway left their nets, and followed him.” ...</p>
      <p>The prompt, unquestioning obedience of these men, with no promise of wages, seems remarkable; but the words of
          Christ were an invitation that carried with it an impelling power. Christ would make these humble ﬁshermen, in
          connection with Himself, the means of taking men out of the service of Satan, and placing them in the service
          of God. In this work they would become His witnesses, bearing to the world His truth unmingled with the
          traditions and sophistries of men. By practicing His virtues, by walking and working with Him, they were to be
          qualiﬁed to be ﬁshers of men....</p>
      <p>For three years they labored in connection with the Saviour, and by His teaching, His works of healing, His
          example, they were prepared to carry on the work that He began. By the simplicity of faith, by pure, humble
          service, the disciples were taught to carry responsibilities in God’s cause.</p>
      <p>There are lessons for us to learn from the experience of the apostles. These men were as true as steel to
          principle. They were men who would not fail nor be discouraged. They were full of reverence and zeal for God,
          full of noble purposes and aspirations. They were by nature as weak and helpless as any of those now engaged
          in the work, but they put their whole trust in the Lord. Wealth they had, but it consisted of mind and soul
          culture; and this every one may have who will make God ﬁrst and last and best in everything. They toiled long
          to learn the lessons given them in the school of Christ, and they did not toil in vain. They bound themselves
          up with the mightiest of all powers, and were ever longing for a deeper, higher, broader comprehension of
          eternal realities, that they might successfully present the treasures of truth to a needy world....</p>
      <p>Everywhere the light of truth is to shine forth, that hearts may be awakened and converted. In all countries
          the gospel is to be proclaimed. God’s servants are to labor in places nigh and afar off, enlarging the
          cultivated portions of the vineyard, and going to the regions beyond. They are to work while the day lasts;
          for the night cometh, in which no man can <nobr>work.—Gospel</nobr> Workers, <nobr>24-26.</nobr></p>
