    <h1>God Works Mightily for His Chosen Ones</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not
          overﬂow thee: when thou walkest through the ﬁre, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the ﬂame kindle upon
          thee. Isaiah 43:2.</strong></p>
      <p>The three Hebrews declared to the whole nation of Babylon their faith in Him whom they worshiped. They relied
          on God. In the hour of their trial they remembered the promise, “When thou passest through the waters, I will
          be with thee; ... when thou walkest through the ﬁre, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the ﬂame kindle
          upon thee.” And in a marvelous manner their faith in the living Word had been honored in the sight of all. The
          tidings of their wonderful deliverance were carried to many countries by the representatives of the different
          nations that had been invited by Nebuchadnezzar to the dedication. Through the faithfulness of His children,
          God was gloriﬁed in all the earth.</p>
      <p>Important are the lessons to be learned from the experience of the Hebrew youth on the plain of Dura. In this
          our day, many of God’s servants, though innocent of wrongdoing, will be given over to suffer humiliation and
          abuse at the hands of those who, inspired by Satan, are ﬁlled with envy and religious bigotry. Especially will
          the wrath of man be aroused against those who hallow the Sabbath of the fourth commandment; and at last a
          universal decree will denounce these as deserving of death.</p>
      <p>The season of distress before God’s people will call for a faith that will not falter. His children must make
          it manifest that He is the only object of their worship, and that no consideration, not even that of life
          itself, can induce them to make the least concession to false worship. To the loyal heart the commands of
          sinful, ﬁnite men will sink into insigniﬁcance beside the word of the eternal God. Truth will be obeyed though
          the result be imprisonment or exile or death.</p>
      <p>As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in the closing period of earth’s history the Lord will
          work mightily in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the right. He who walked with the Hebrew worthies
          in the ﬁery furnace will be with His followers wherever they are. His abiding presence will comfort and
          sustain.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the time of <nobr>trouble—trouble</nobr> such as has not been since there was a
          <nobr>nation—His</nobr> chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the
          weakest of God’s saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah will
          reveal Himself as a “God of gods,” able to save to the uttermost those who have put their trust in
          <nobr>Him.—Prophets</nobr> and Kings, 512, 513.</p>
