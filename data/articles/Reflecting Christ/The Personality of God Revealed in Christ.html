    <h1>The Personality of God Revealed in Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I and my Father are one. John 10:30.</strong></p>
      <p>As a personal being, God has revealed Himself in His Son. The outshining of the Father’s glory, “and the
          express image of his person” (Hebrews 1:3), Jesus, as a personal Saviour, came to the world. As a personal
          Saviour He ascended on high. As a personal Saviour He intercedes in the heavenly courts. Before the throne of
          God in our behalf ministers “one like unto the Son of man” (Revelation 1:13).</p>
      <p>Christ, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of His divinity and came to live as a man among
          men, that they might, without being consumed, become acquainted with their Creator. Since sin brought
          separation between man and his Maker, no man has seen God at any time, except as He is manifested through
          Christ.</p>
      <p>“I and my Father are one,” Christ declared (John 10:30). “No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither
          knoweth any man the Father, save the Son and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him” (John 10:30; Matthew
          11:27).</p>
      <p>Christ came to teach human beings what God desires them to know. In the heavens above, in the earth, in the
          broad waters of the ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify to His power, His wisdom,
          His love. Yet not from the stars or the ocean or the cataract can we learn of the personality of God as it was
          revealed in Christ.</p>
      <p>God saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to portray both His personality and His character. He
          sent His Son into the world to manifest, so far as could be endured by human sight, the nature and the
          attributes of the invisible God....</p>
      <p>Taking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with humanity, and at the same time to reveal our heavenly
          Father to sinful human beings. He who had been in the presence of the Father from the beginning, He who was
          the express image of the invisible God, was alone able to reveal the character of the Deity to mankind. He was
          in all things made like unto His brethren. He became ﬂesh even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary.
          He was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men; yet He was the blameless Son of
          God.... Tender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others,</p>
      <p>He represented the character of God, and was constantly engaged in service for God and <nobr>man.—The</nobr>
          Ministry of Healing, <nobr>418-423.</nobr></p>
      <p>The theme of redemption will employ the minds and tongues of the redeemed through everlasting ages. The
          reﬂection of the glory of God will shine forth forever and ever from the Saviour’s <nobr>face.—Letter</nobr>
          280, 1904.</p>
