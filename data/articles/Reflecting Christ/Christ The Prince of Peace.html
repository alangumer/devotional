    <h1>Christ “The Prince of Peace”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Matthew 5:9.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ is “The Prince of Peace” (Isaiah 9:6), and it is His mission to restore to earth and heaven the peace
          that sin has broken. “Being justiﬁed by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans
          5:1). Whoever consents to renounce sin and open his heart to the love of Christ becomes a partaker of this
          heavenly peace.</p>
      <p>There is no other ground of peace than this. The grace of Christ, received into the heart, subdues enmity; it
          allays strife and ﬁlls the soul with love. He who is at peace with God and his fellow men cannot be made
          miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil surmisings will ﬁnd no room there; hatred cannot exist. The
          heart that is in harmony with God is a partaker of the peace of heaven and will diffuse its blessed inﬂuence
          on all around. The spirit of peace will rest like dew upon hearts weary and troubled with worldly strife.</p>
      <p>Christ’s followers are sent to the world with the message of peace. Whoever, by the quiet, unconscious inﬂuence
          of a holy life, shall reveal the love of Christ; whoever, by word or deed, shall lead another to renounce sin
          and yield his heart to God, is a peacemaker.</p>
      <p>And “blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” The spirit of peace is
          evidence of their connection with heaven. The sweet savor of Christ surrounds them. The fragrance of the life,
          the loveliness of the character, reveal to the world the fact that they are children of God. Men take
          knowledge of them that they have been with Jesus....</p>
      <p>“And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the
          grass” (Micah <nobr>5:7).—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, 27, 28.</p>
      <p>When Isaiah foretold the birth of the Messiah, he ascribed to Him the title, “Prince of Peace.” When angels
          announced to the shepherds that Christ was born, they sang above the plains of Bethlehem: “Glory to God in the
          highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men” (Luke 2:14).</p>
      <p>There is a seeming contradiction between these prophetic declarations and the words of Christ: “I came not to
          send peace, but a sword” (Matthew 10:34). But, rightly understood, the two are in perfect harmony. The gospel
          is a message of peace. Christianity is a system which, received and obeyed, would spread peace, harmony, and
          happiness throughout the earth. The religion of Christ will unite in close brotherhood all who accept its
          teachings. It was the mission of Jesus to reconcile men to God, and thus to one <nobr>another.—The</nobr>
          Great Controversy, 46, 47.</p>
