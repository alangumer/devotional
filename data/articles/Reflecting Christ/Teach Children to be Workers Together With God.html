    <h1>Teach Children to be Workers Together With God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them. Hosea 14:9.</strong></p>
      <p>In the life of a Christian, the things of this world, the idols of pride, extravagance, and
          <nobr>self-indulgence,</nobr> are to have no place. God did not form the eye to be used for selﬁsh purposes.
          He gave us the power of vision in order that we might behold and admire the Saviour in His works, which He has
          created for our pleasure.</p>
      <p>As children prepare to attend one of our schools, wise parents will help them to understand that in school life
          they are to strive to form a character that will ﬁt them to associate with the unfallen beings of the
          universe. And this they can do only through the overcoming power that Christ will give them. Without His
          grace, no one can form a Christlike character.</p>
      <p>Parents, teach your children to become workers with you in the church. Educate them in such a way that they
          will delight to be workers together with God. Impress upon their minds the thought that as they grow older,
          their opportunities for service will enlarge, and their power and ability will increase proportionately. Let
          them understand that those who give themselves to God will become channels of blessing to others who know Him
          not. Teach them how to have power to prevail with God. If this were done faithfully by every parent, we should
          see consecrated workers <nobr>everywhere.—Manuscript</nobr> 67, 1903. Church members, young and old, should be
          educated to go forth to proclaim this last message to the world. If they go in humility, angels of God will go
          with them, teaching them how to lift up the voice in prayer, how to raise the voice in song, and how to
          proclaim the gospel message for this <nobr>time.—Messages</nobr> to Young People, 217.</p>
      <p>The idea of holding Bible readings is a <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> idea, and opens the way to put hundreds of
          young men and women into the ﬁeld to do an important work, which otherwise could not have been done.</p>
      <p>The Bible is unchained. It can be carried to every man’s door, and its truths may be presented to every man’s
          conscience. There are many who, like the noble Bereans, will search the Scriptures daily for themselves, when
          the truth is presented, to see whether or not these things are so.... Jesus, the world’s Redeemer, bids men
          not only to read, but to</p>
      <p>“search the scriptures.” This is a great and important work, and it is committed to us, and in doing this we
          shall be greatly beneﬁted; for obedience to Christ’s command will not go unrewarded. He will crown with
          especial tokens of His favor this act of loyalty in following the light revealed in His
          <nobr>Word.—Messages</nobr> to Young People, 220.</p>
