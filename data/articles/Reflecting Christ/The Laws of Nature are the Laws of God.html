    <h1>The Laws of Nature are the Laws of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.... For they are life unto</strong></p>
      <p>those that ﬁnd them, and health to all their ﬂesh. Proverbs <nobr>4:20-22.</nobr></p>
      <p>Since the mind and the soul ﬁnd expression through the body, both mental and spiritual vigor are in great
          degree dependent upon physical strength and activity; whatever promotes physical health promotes the
          development of a strong mind and a <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> character. Without health, no one can as
          distinctly understand or as completely fulﬁll his obligations to himself, to his fellow beings, or to his
          Creator. Therefore the health should be as faithfully guarded as the character. A knowledge of physiology and
          hygiene should be the basis of all educational effort....</p>
      <p>The youth, in the freshness and vigor of life, little realize the value of their abounding energy. A treasure
          more precious than gold, more essential to advancement than learning or rank or <nobr>riches—how</nobr>
          lightly it is held! how rashly squandered! How many a man, sacriﬁcing health in the struggle for riches or
          power, has almost reached the object of his desire, only to fall helpless, while another, possessing superior
          physical endurance, grasped the <nobr>longed-for</nobr> prize! Through morbid conditions, the result of
          neglecting the laws of health, how many have been led into evil practices, to the sacriﬁce of every hope for
          this world and the next!</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>The youth should be taught that the laws of nature are the laws of <nobr>God—as</nobr> truly divine as are the
          precepts of the Decalogue. The laws that govern our physical organism, God has written upon every nerve,
          muscle, and ﬁber of the body. Every careless or willful violation of these laws is a sin against our Creator.
          How necessary, then, that a thorough knowledge of these laws should be imparted! ...</p>
      <p>The inﬂuence of the mind on the body, as well as of the body on the mind, should be emphasized. The electric
          power of the brain, promoted by mental activity, vitalizes the whole system, and is thus an invaluable aid in
          resisting disease.... The power of the will</p>
      <p>and the importance of <nobr>self-control,</nobr> both in the preservation and in the recovery of health, the
          depressing and even ruinous effect of anger, discontent, selﬁshness, or impurity, and, on the other hand, the
          marvelous <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power to be found in cheerfulness, unselﬁshness, gratitude, should also be
          shown. There is a physiological <nobr>truth—truth</nobr> that we need to <nobr>consider—in</nobr> the
          scripture, “A merry [rejoicing] heart doeth good like a medicine” (Proverbs
          <nobr>17:22).—Education,</nobr><nobr>195-197.</nobr></p>
