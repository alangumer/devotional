    <h1>Life is a Holy Trust</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>With thee is the foundation of life: in thy light shall we see the light. Psalm 36:9. We need as
          workers to keep looking unto Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of our faith. As</strong></p>
      <p>workers together with God, we are to draw souls to Christ. We are to remember that each has a special part to
          act in the Master’s service. O how much good the members of the church might accomplish if they realized the
          responsibility resting upon them to point those with whom they come in contact to the Redeemer.</p>
      <p>When church members shall disinterestedly engage in the work given them of God, a much stronger inﬂuence will
          be exerted in behalf of souls ready to die, and much more earnest efforts will be put forth in medical
          missionary lines. When every member of the church does his part faithfully, the workers in the ﬁeld will be
          helped and encouraged and the cause of God will move forward with power....</p>
      <p>When you take time to cultivate your garden, thus gaining the exercise needed to keep the system in good
          working order, you are just as much doing the work of God as in holding meetings. God is our Father, He loves
          us, and He does not require any of His servants to abuse their bodies.</p>
      <p>Another cause, both of ill health and inefﬁciency in labor, is indigestion. It is impossible for the brain to
          do its best work when the digestive powers are abused. Many eat hurriedly of various kinds of food; this
          causes war in the stomach, and confuses the brain. The use of unwholesome food, and overeating of even that
          which is wholesome, should alike be avoided. Many eat at all hours, regardless of the laws of health. Then
          gloom covers the mind. How can men be honored with divine enlightenment when they are so reckless in their
          habits, so inattentive to the light which God has given in regard to these things?...</p>
      <p>Life is a holy trust, which God alone can enable us to keep, and to use to His glory. But He who formed the
          wonderful structure of the body will take special care to keep it in order if men do not work at
          <nobr>cross-purposes</nobr> with Him. Every talent entrusted to us He will help us to improve and use in
          accordance with the will of the Giver. Days, months, and years are added to our existence that we may improve
          our opportunities and advantages for working out our individual salvation, and by our unselﬁsh life promote
          the <nobr>well-being</nobr> of others. Thus may we build up the kingdom of Christ, and make manifest the glory
          of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 20, 1912.</p>
