      <p><strong>That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones,
          polished after the similitude of a palace. Psalm 144:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The ﬁrst and most urgent duty which the mother owes to her Creator is to train for Him the children that He has
          given her.... How careful, then, should be her language and behavior</p>
      <p>in the presence of these little learners....</p>
      <p>Mothers, awake to the fact that your inﬂuence and example are affecting the character and destiny of your
          children; and in view of your responsibility, develop a <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> mind, and a pure character,
          reﬂecting only the true, the good, and the beautiful.</p>
      <p>Your compassionate Redeemer is watching you with love and sympathy, ready to hear your prayers, and to render
          you the assistance which you need. He knows the burdens of every mother’s heart, and is her best friend in
          every emergency. His everlasting arms support the <nobr>God-fearing,</nobr> faithful mother. When upon earth,
          He had a mother that struggled with poverty, having many anxious cares and perplexities, and He sympathizes
          with every Christian mother in her cares and anxieties. That Saviour who took a long journey for the purpose
          of relieving the anxious heart of a woman whose daughter was possessed by an evil spirit will hear the
          mother’s prayers, and will bless her children.</p>
      <p>He who gave back to the widow her only son as he was carried to the burial is touched today by the woe of the
          bereaved mother. He who wept tears of sympathy at the grave of Lazarus, and gave back to Martha and Mary their
          buried brother; who pardoned Mary Magdalene; who remembered His mother when He was hanging in agony upon the
          cross; who appeared to the weeping women, and made them His messengers to spread the ﬁrst glad tidings of a
          risen <nobr>Saviour—He</nobr> is woman’s best friend today, and is ready to aid her in all the relations of
          life.</p>
      <p>Our Saviour, who understands our heart struggles, and knows the weakness of our natures, pities our inﬁrmities,
          forgives our errors, and bestows upon us the graces which we earnestly desire. Joy, peace,
          <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, faith, and charity are the elements of the Christian character. These
          precious graces are the fruit of the Spirit, and the Christian’s crown and shield. Where these graces reign in
          the home, the sons are “as plants grown up in their youth,” and the daughters “as corner stones, polished
          after the similitude of a palace.” These heavenly attainments are not dependent upon circumstances, nor the
          will of imperfect judgment of man. Nothing can give more perfect contentment and satisfaction than the
          cultivation of a Christian character; the most exalted aspirations can aim at nothing <nobr>higher.—The</nobr>
          Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.</p>
