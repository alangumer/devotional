      <p><strong>Honour thy father and mother; which is the ﬁrst commandment with promise; that it may be well with
          thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. Ephesians <nobr>6:2-3.</nobr></strong></p>
      <p>Few parents take time to think of how much depends on the instruction and training a child receives during the
          early years of its life. It is at this time that the foundation of a child’s character is laid....</p>
      <p>Mothers, do not forget that God requires you to give your children constant, loving care. He does not want you
          to be a slave to your children, but He does want you to teach them to live for Him. Day by day give them
          lessons that will prepare them for future usefulness. One lesson that you will have to repeat over and over
          again is the lesson of obedience. Teach your children that they are not to rule, that they are to respect your
          wishes, and yield to your authority. Thus you are teaching them <nobr>self-control....</nobr></p>
      <p>When children lose their <nobr>self-control,</nobr> and speak passionate words, the parents should for a time
          keep silence, neither reproving nor condemning. At such times silence is golden, and will do more to bring
          repentance than any words that can be uttered. Satan is well pleased when parents irritate their children by
          speaking harsh, angry words. Paul has given a caution on this point: “Fathers, provoke not your children to
          anger, lest they be discouraged.” They may be very wrong, but you cannot lead them to the right by losing
          patience with them. Let your calmness help to restore them to a proper frame of mind.</p>
      <p>Jesus loves children and youth. He rejoices when He sees Satan repulsed in his efforts to overcome them. Many a
          youth is in imminent peril through manifold temptations, but the Saviour has the tenderest sympathy for him,
          and sends His angels to guard and protect him. He is the good shepherd, ever ready to go into the wilderness
          to seek for the lost, straying sheep....</p>
      <p>Mothers, do you sigh for a missionary ﬁeld? In your home you have a missionary ﬁeld in which you may labor with
          untiring energy and unﬂagging zeal, knowing that the results of your work will endure through all eternity....
          The work of the mother who has a close</p>
      <p>connection with Christ is of inﬁnite worth. Her ministry of love makes the home a Bethel. Christ works with
          her, turning the common water of life into the wine of heaven.</p>
      <p>Christian parents, you are charged with the responsibility of showing the world the power and excellency of
          home religion. Be controlled by principle, not by impulse. Work with the consciousness that God is your
          helper.... Guided by Him, your children will grow</p>
      <p>up to bless and honor you in this life and in the life to <nobr>come.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, January 24,
          1907.</p>
