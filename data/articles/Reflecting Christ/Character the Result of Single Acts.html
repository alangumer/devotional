    <h1>Character the Result of Single Acts</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. Luke 16:10.</strong></p>
      <p>It is conscientious attention to what the world terms “little things” that makes life a success. Little deeds
          of charity, little acts of <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> speaking simple words of helpfulness, watching against
          little <nobr>sins—this</nobr> is Christianity. A grateful acknowledgment of daily blessings, a wise
          improvement of daily opportunities, a diligent cultivation of entrusted <nobr>talents—this</nobr> is what the
          Master calls for.</p>
      <p>He who faithfully performs small duties will be prepared to answer the demands of larger responsibilities. The
          man who is kind and courteous in the daily life, who is generous and forbearing in his family, whose constant
          aim it is to make home happy, will be the ﬁrst to deny self and make sacriﬁces when the Master calls.</p>
      <p>We may be willing to give our property to the cause of God, but this will not count unless we give Him also a
          heart of love and gratitude. Those who would be true missionaries in foreign ﬁelds must ﬁrst be true
          missionaries in the home. Those who desire to work in the Master’s vineyard must prepare themselves for this
          by a careful cultivation of the little piece of vineyard He has entrusted to their care.</p>
      <p>As a man “thinketh in his heart, so is he.” Many thoughts make up the unwritten history of a single day; and
          these thoughts have much to do with the formation of character. Our thoughts are to be strictly guarded; for
          one impure thought makes a deep impression on the soul. An evil thought leaves an evil impress on the mind. If
          the thoughts are pure and holy, the man is better for having cherished them. By them the spiritual pulse is
          quickened, and the power for doing good is increased. And as one drop of rain prepares the way for another in
          moistening the earth, so one good thought prepares the way for another....</p>
      <p>The longest chain is composed of separate links. If one of these links is faulty, the chain is worthless. Thus
          it is with character. A <nobr>well-balanced</nobr> character is formed by single acts well performed. One
          defect, cultivated instead of being overcome, makes the man imperfect, and closes against him the gate of the
          Holy City. He who enters heaven must have a character that is without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
          Naught that deﬁleth can ever enter there. In all the redeemed host not one defect will be seen.</p>
      <p>God’s work is perfect as a whole because it is perfect in every part, however minute. He fashions the tiny
          spear of grass with as much care as He would exercise in making a world. If we desire to be perfect, even as
          our Father in heaven is perfect, we must be faithful in doing little <nobr>things.—Messages</nobr> to Young
          People, <nobr>143-145.</nobr></p>
