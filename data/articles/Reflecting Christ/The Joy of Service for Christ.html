    <h1>The Joy of Service for Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 2 Corinthians 9:6. Ministry means service, and
          to this ministry we are all called. It is a dishonor to God for</strong></p>
      <p>anyone to choose a life of <nobr>self-pleasing.</nobr> My brethren and sisters, do you realize that every year
          thousands and thousands of souls are perishing, dying in their sins because the light of truth has not been
          ﬂashed upon their pathway?...</p>
      <p>There is a great work to be done in our world. Men and women are to be converted, not by the gift of tongues
          nor by the working of miracles, but by the preaching of Christ cruciﬁed. Why delay the effort to make the
          world better? Why wait for some wonderful thing to be done, some costly apparatus to be provided? However
          humble your sphere, however lowly your work, if you labor in harmony with the teachings of the Saviour, He
          will reveal Himself through you, and your inﬂuence will draw souls to Him. He will honor the meek and lowly
          ones, who seek earnestly to do service for Him. Into all that we do, whether our work be in the shop, on the
          farm, or in the ofﬁce, we are to bring the endeavor to save souls.</p>
      <p>We are to sow beside all waters, keeping our souls in the love of God, working while it is day, using the means
          entrusted to us in the Master’s service. Whatever our hands ﬁnd to do, we are to do it with cheerfulness;
          whatever sacriﬁce we are called upon to make, we are to make it cheerfully. As we sow beside all waters, we
          shall realize the truth of the words, “He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.”</p>
      <p>We owe everything to grace, sovereign grace. Grace ordained our redemption, our regeneration, and our adoption
          to heirship with Jesus Christ. Let this grace be revealed to others.</p>
      <p>The Saviour takes those whom He ﬁnds will be molded, and uses them for His own name’s glory. He uses material
          that others would pass by, and works in all who will give themselves to Him. He delights to take apparently
          hopeless material, those whom Satan has debased, and through whom he has worked, and make them the subjects of
          His grace. He rejoices to deliver them from suffering, and from the wrath that is to fall upon the
          disobedient. He makes His children His agents in the accomplishment of this work, and in its success, even in
          this life, they ﬁnd a precious reward.</p>
      <p>But what is this compared with the joy that will be theirs in the great day of ﬁnal <nobr>revealing?—The</nobr>
          Review and Herald, January 5, 1905.</p>
