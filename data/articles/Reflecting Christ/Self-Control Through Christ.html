    <h1>Self-Control Through Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Good sense makes a man slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. Proverbs 19:11,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a wonderful power in silence. When impatient words are spoken to you, do not retaliate. Words spoken
          in reply to one who is angry usually act as a whip, lashing the temper into greater fury. But anger met by
          silence quickly dies away. Let the Christian bridle his tongue, ﬁrmly resolving not to speak harsh, impatient
          words. With the tongue bridled, he may be victorious in every trial of patience through which he is called to
          pass.</p>
      <p>In his own strength man cannot rule his spirit. But through Christ he may gain <nobr>self-control.</nobr> In
          his strength he may bring his thoughts and words into subjection to the will of God. The religion of Christ
          brings the emotions under the control of reason and disciplines the tongue. Under its inﬂuence the hasty
          temper is subdued, and the heart is ﬁlled with patience and gentleness.</p>
      <p>Hold ﬁrmly to the One who has all power in heaven and in earth. Though you so often fail to reveal patience and
          calmness, do not give up the struggle. Resolve again, this time more ﬁrmly, to be patient under every
          provocation. And never take your eyes off your divine Example.</p>
      <p>God’s ideal for His children is higher than the highest human thought can reach. “Be ye therefore perfect, even
          as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” This command is a promise. The plan of redemption contemplates
          our complete recovery from the power of Satan. Christ always separates the contrite soul from sin. He came to
          destroy the works of the devil. And He has made provision that the Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every
          repentant soul to keep him from sinning.</p>
      <p>The tempter’s agency is not to be accounted an excuse for one wrong act. Satan is jubilant when he hears the
          professed followers of Christ making excuses for their deformity of character. It is these excuses that lead
          to sin. A holy temper, a Christlike life, is attainable by every repenting, believing child of
          <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, October 31, 1907.</p>
      <p>Christ gave Himself for the saving of the sinner. Those whose sins are forgiven, who love Jesus, will be united
          with Him. They will bear the yoke of Christ. This yoke is not to hamper them, not to make their religious life
          one of unsatisfying toil. No; the yoke of Christ is to be the very means by which the Christian life is to
          become one of pleasure and joy. The Christian is to be joyful in contemplation of that which the Lord has done
          in giving His <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son to die for the world, “that whosoever believeth in him should not
          perish, but have everlasting <nobr>life.”—Messages</nobr> to Young People, 138.</p>
