      <p><strong>In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean upon him
          that smote them, but will lean upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. A remnant will return, the
          remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. Isaiah 10:20, 21, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>In vision I saw two armies in terrible conﬂict. One army was led by banners bearing the world’s insignia; the
          other was led by the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. Standard after standard was left to trail in the
          dust as company after company from the Lord’s army joined the foe and tribe after tribe from the ranks of the
          enemy united with the <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people of God. An angel ﬂying in the midst of heaven
          put the standard of Immanuel into many hands, while a mighty general cried out with a loud voice: “Come into
          line. Let those who are loyal to the commandments of God and the testimony of Christ now take their position.
          Come out from among them, and be ye separate.” ...</p>
      <p>The battle raged. Victory alternated from side to side. Now the soldiers of the cross gave way, “as when a
          standardbearer fainteth” (Isaiah 10:18). But their apparent retreat was but to gain a more advantageous
          position. Shouts of joy were heard. A song of praise to God went up, and angel voices united in the song, as
          Christ’s soldiers planted His banner on the walls of fortresses till then held by the enemy. The Captain of
          our salvation was ordering the battle and sending support to His soldiers. His power was mightily displayed,
          encouraging them to press the battle to the gates. He taught them terrible things in righteousness as He led
          them on step by step, conquering and to conquer.</p>
      <p>At last the victory was gained. The army following the banner with the inscription, “The commandments of God,
          and the faith of Jesus,” was gloriously <nobr>triumphant.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 8:41.</p>
      <p>There are many doctrines current in our world. There is many a religion current that numbers its thousands and
          tens of thousands, but there is but one that bears the superscription and the stamp of God. There is a
          religion of man and a religion of God. We must have our souls riveted to the eternal Rock....</p>
      <p>Satan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his power as supreme. The church may appear as about to
          fall, but it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted <nobr>out—the</nobr> chaff
          separated from the precious wheat. This is a terrible ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place. None but
          those who have been overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony will be found with the
          loyal and true, without spot or stain of sin, without guile in their mouths. We must be divested of our
          <nobr>self-righteousness</nobr> and arrayed in the righteousness of <nobr>Christ.—Selected</nobr> Messages
