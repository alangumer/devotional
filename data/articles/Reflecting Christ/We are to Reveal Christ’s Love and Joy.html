    <h1>We are to Reveal Christ’s Love and Joy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now the God of hope ﬁll you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through
          the power of the Holy Ghost. Romans 15:13.</strong></p>
      <p>In the great and measureless gift of the Holy Spirit are contained all of heaven’s resources. It is not because
          of any restriction on the part of God that the riches of His grace do not ﬂow earthward to men. If all were
          willing to receive, all would become ﬁlled with His Spirit. It is the privilege of every soul to be a living
          channel through which God can communicate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable riches of
          Christ. There is nothing that Christ desires so much as agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and
          character. There is nothing that the world needs so much as the manifestation through humanity of the
          Saviour’s love. All heaven is waiting for channels through which can be poured the holy oil to be a joy and
          blessing to human hearts.</p>
      <p>Christ has made every provision that His church shall be a transformed body, illumined with the Light of the
          world, possessing the glory of Emmanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a
          spiritual atmosphere of light and peace. He desires that we shall reveal His own joy in our lives.</p>
      <p>The indwelling of the Spirit will be shown by the outﬂowing of heavenly love. The divine fullness will ﬂow
          through the consecrated human agent, to be given forth to others.</p>
      <p>The Sun of Righteousness has “healing in his wings” (Malachi 4:2). So from every true disciple is to be
          diffused an inﬂuence for life, courage, helpfulness, and true healing.</p>
      <p>The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of sin; it means taking away our sins, and ﬁlling the
          vacuum with the graces of the Holy Spirit. It means divine illumination, rejoicing in God. It means a heart
          emptied of self, and blessed with the abiding presence of Christ. When Christ reigns in the soul, there is
          purity, freedom from sin. The glory, the fullness, the completeness of the gospel plan is fulﬁlled in the
          life. The acceptance of the Saviour brings a glow of perfect peace, perfect love, perfect assurance. The
          beauty and fragrance of the character of Christ revealed in the life testiﬁes that God has indeed sent His Son
          into the world to be its <nobr>Saviour.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, 419, 420.</p>
      <p>There is peace in believing, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Believing brings peace, and trusting in God brings
          <nobr>joy.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 2:319, 320.</p>
