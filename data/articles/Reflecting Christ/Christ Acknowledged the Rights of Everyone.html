    <h1>Christ Acknowledged the Rights of Everyone</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. Acts
          10:35.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus demands our acknowledgment of the rights of every man. Men’s social rights, and their rights as
          Christians, are to be taken into consideration. All are to be treated with reﬁnement and delicacy, as the sons
          and daughters of God.</p>
      <p>Christianity will make a man a gentleman. Christ was courteous, even to His persecutors; and His true followers
          will manifest the same spirit. Look at Paul when brought before rulers. His speech before Agrippa is an
          illustration of true courtesy as well as persuasive eloquence. The gospel does not encourage the formal
          politeness current with the world, but the courtesy that springs from real kindness of heart.</p>
      <p>The most careful attention to the outward proprieties of life is not sufﬁcient to shut out all fretfulness,
          harsh judgment, and unbecoming speech. True reﬁnement will never be revealed so long as self is considered the
          supreme object. Love must dwell in the heart. A thoroughgoing Christian draws his motives of action from his
          deep heartlove for the Master. Up through the roots of his affection for Christ springs an unselﬁsh interest
          in his brethren. Love imparts to its possessor grace, propriety, and comeliness of deportment. It illuminates
          the countenance and subdues the voice; it reﬁnes and elevates the entire <nobr>being.—Gospel</nobr> Workers,
          123.</p>
      <p>Some with whom you are brought in contact may be rough and uncourteous, but do not, because of this, be less
          courteous yourself. He who wishes to preserve his own <nobr>self-respect</nobr> must be careful not to wound
          needlessly the <nobr>self-respect</nobr> of others. This rule should be sacredly observed toward the dullest,
          the most blundering. What God intends to do with these apparently unpromising ones, you do not know. He has in
          the past accepted persons no more promising or attractive to do a great work for Him. His Spirit, moving upon
          the heart, has roused every faculty to vigorous action. The Lord saw in these rough, unhewn stones precious
          material, which would stand the test of storm and heat and pressure.— Gospel Workers, 122.</p>
      <p>Be polite to those with whom you come in contact; thus you will be polite to God. Praise Him for His goodness.
          Thus you are witnesses for Him, and you are preparing for the society of the angels. You are learning in this
          world how to conduct yourselves in the family of Christ in <nobr>heaven.—Manuscript</nobr> 31, 1903.</p>
