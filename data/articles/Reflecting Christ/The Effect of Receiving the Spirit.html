    <h1>The Effect of Receiving the Spirit</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know
          the things that are freely given to us of God. 1 Corinthians 2:12.</strong></p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit enabled the disciples to exalt the Lord alone, and guided the pens of the sacred historians,
          that the record of the words and works of Christ might be given to the world. Today this Spirit is constantly
          at work, seeking to draw the attention of men to the great sacriﬁce made upon the cross of Calvary, to unfold
          to the world the love of God to man, and to open to the convicted soul the promises of the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>It is the Spirit that causes to shine into darkened minds the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness; that
          makes men’s hearts burn within them with an awakened realization of the truths of eternity; that presents
          before the mind the great standard of righteousness, and convinces of sin, that inspires faith in Him who
          alone can save from sin; that works to transform character by withdrawing the affections of men from those
          things that are temporal and perishable, and ﬁxing them upon the eternal inheritance. The Spirit
          <nobr>re-creates,</nobr> reﬁnes, and sanctiﬁes human beings, ﬁtting them to become members of the royal
          family, children of the heavenly King.</p>
      <p>When one is fully emptied of self, when every false God is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is ﬁlled by the
          inﬂowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith that puriﬁes the soul from deﬁlement. He is
          conformed to the Spirit, and he minds the things of the Spirit. He has no conﬁdence in self. Christ is all and
          in all. He receives with meekness the truth that is constantly being unfolded, and gives the Lord all the
          glory, saying, “God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.” ...</p>
      <p>The Spirit that reveals also works in him the fruits of righteousness. Christ is in him, “a well of water
          springing up into everlasting life.” He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of fruit to the
          glory of God. What is the character of the fruit borne? The fruit of the Spirit is “love,” not hatred; “joy,”
          not discontent and mourning; “peace,” not irritation, anxiety, and manufactured trials. It is “longsuffering,
          gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance” (Galatians 5:22, 23). Those who have this Spirit are
          earnest workers together with God.... They speak words of solid sense, and from the treasury of the heart
          bring forth</p>
      <p>pure, sacred things, after the example of <nobr>Christ.—Gospel</nobr> Workers, <nobr>286-288.</nobr></p>
