    <h1>Christ Sacriﬁced Himself For Us</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with
          glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. Hebrews 2:9.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord created man pure and holy. But Satan led him astray, perverting his principles and corrupting his
          mind, turning his thoughts into a wrong channel. His purpose was to make the world wholly corrupt.</p>
      <p>Christ saw man’s fearful danger, and He determined to save him by the sacriﬁce of Himself. That He might
          accomplish His purpose of love for the fallen race, He became bone of our bone and ﬂesh of our ﬂesh. “As the
          children are partakers of ﬂesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death
          he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of
          death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.... Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be</p>
      <p>made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God,
          to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is
          able to succor them that are tempted.” ...</p>
      <p>Through the agency of the Holy Spirit, a new principle of mental and spiritual power was to be brought to man,
          who, through association with divinity, was to become one with God. Christ, the redeemer and restorer, was to
          sanctify and purify man’s mind, making it a power that would draw other minds to Himself. It is His purpose,
          by the elevating, sanctifying power of the truth, to give men nobility and dignity. He desires His children to
          reveal His character, to exert His inﬂuence, that other minds may be drawn into harmony with His mind....</p>
      <p>Christ might, because of our guilt, have moved far away from us. But instead of moving farther away, He came
          and dwelt among us, ﬁlled with all the fullness of the Godhead, to be one with us, that through His grace we
          might attain perfection. By a death of shame and suffering He paid our ransom. From the highest excellency He
          came, His divinity clothed with humanity, descending step by step to the lowest depths of humiliation. No line
          can measure the depth of His love....</p>
      <p>I marvel that professing Christians do not grasp the divine resources, that they do not see the cross more
          clearly as the medium of forgiveness and pardon, the means of bringing the proud, selﬁsh heart of man into
          direct contact with the Holy Spirit, that the riches of Christ may be poured into the mind, and the human
          agent be adorned with the graces of the Spirit, that Christ may be commended to those who know Him
          <nobr>not.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September 24, 1902.</p>
