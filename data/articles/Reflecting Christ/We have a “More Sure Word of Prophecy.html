    <h1>We have a “More Sure Word of Prophecy”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of
          our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:16.</strong></p>
      <p>The apostle was well qualiﬁed to speak of the purposes of God concerning the human race; for during the earthly
          ministry of Christ he had seen and heard much that pertained to the kingdom of God. “We have not followed
          cunningly devised fables,” he reminded the believers, “when we made known unto you the power and coming of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For He received from God the Father honour and glory,
          when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
          pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.”</p>
      <p>Yet convincing as was this evidence of the certainty of the believers’ hope, there was another still more
          convincing in the witness of prophecy, through which the faith of all must be conﬁrmed and securely anchored.
          “We have also,” Peter declared, “a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto
          a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this
          ﬁrst, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old
          time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”</p>
      <p>While exalting the “sure word of prophecy” as a safe guide in times of peril, the apostle solemnly warned the
          church against the torch of false prophecy, which would be uplifted by “false teachers,” who would privily
          bring in “damnable heresies, even denying the Lord” (2 Peter 2:1). These false teachers, arising in the church
          and accounted true by many of their brethren in the faith, the apostle compared to “wells without water,
          clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.” “The latter end is
          worse with them,” he declared, “than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way
          of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.”
          ...</p>
      <p>Not all, however, would be ensnared by the enemy’s devices. As the end of all things earthly should approach,
          there would be faithful ones able to discern the signs of the times. While a large number of professing
          believers would deny their faith by their works, there would be a remnant who would endure to the end....
          “Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye</p>
      <p>look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
          <nobr>blameless.”—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>534-536.</nobr></p>
