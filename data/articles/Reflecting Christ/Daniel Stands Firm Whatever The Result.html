    <h1>Daniel Stands Firm Whatever The Result</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then the king ordered Ashpenaz ... to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the
          <nobr>nobility—young</nobr> men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of
          learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualiﬁed to serve in the king’s palace. Daniel 1:3, 4,
          N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The prophet Daniel was an illustrious character. He was a bright example of what men may become when united
          with the God of wisdom. A brief account of the life of this holy man of God is left on record for the
          encouragement of those who should afterward be called to endure trial and temptation.</p>
      <p>When the people of Israel, their king, nobles, and priests were carried into captivity, four of their number
          were selected to serve in the court of the king of Babylon. One of these was Daniel, who early gave promise of
          the remarkable ability developed in later years. These youth were all of princely birth, and are described as
          “children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
          understanding science, and such as had ability in them” (Daniel 1:4).</p>
      <p>Perceiving the superior talents of these youthful captives, King Nebuchadnezzar determined to prepare them to
          ﬁll important positions in his kingdom. That they might be fully qualiﬁed for their life at court, according
          to Oriental custom, they were to be taught the language of the Chaldeans, and to be subjected for three years
          to a thorough course of physical and intellectual discipline.</p>
      <p>The youth in this school of training were not only to be admitted to the royal palace, but it was provided that
          they should eat of the meat and drink of the wine which came from the king’s table....</p>
      <p>Among the viands placed before the king were swine’s ﬂesh and other meats which were declared unclean by the
          law of Moses, and which the Hebrews had been expressly forbidden to eat. Here Daniel was brought to a severe
          test. Should he adhere to the teachings of his fathers concerning meats and drinks, and offend the king, and
          probably lose not only his position but his life? or should he disregard the commandment of the Lord and
          retain the favor of the king, thus securing great intellectual advantages and the most ﬂattering worldly
          prospects?</p>
      <p>Daniel did not long hesitate. He decided to stand ﬁrm in his integrity, let the result be what it might. He
          “purposed in his heart that he would not deﬁle himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine
          which he drank” (verse 8).... He made God his strength,</p>
      <p>and the fear of God was continually before him in all the transactions of his <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed
          Life, <nobr>18-20</nobr></p>
