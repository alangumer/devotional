    <h1>What True Surrender To God Involves</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
          sent. John 17:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Wait not for some magical change to be wrought in you, without taking the requisite steps yourself. Life must
          be with you a humble working out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you
          to will and to do of His good pleasure. Halt not, but escape for your life....</p>
      <p>Christ requires that we shall press together, that we shall be one with Him as He is one with the Father. You
          must depend on God, be disciplined and trained for the higher life. Yes, depend on God; wait His pleasure;
          follow Him; rely in obedience on the strength of His Word.</p>
      <p>To obey when it seems the hardest is true surrender to God. This will quicken your moral nature and subdue your
          pride. Learn to submit your will to God’s will, and you will be made meet for the inheritance of the saints in
          <nobr>light.—Manuscript</nobr> 12, 1888.</p>
      <p>A general faith is not enough. We must put on the robe of Christ’s righteousness and wear it openly, bravely,
          decidedly, exhibiting Christ, and not expect too much of ﬁnite man, but keep looking unto Jesus, and become
          ravished with the perfections of His character. Then we shall individually make manifest the character of
          Jesus, and make it evident that we are invigorated by the truth; because it sanctiﬁes the soul and brings into
          captivity every thought to the obedience of <nobr>Christ.—Letter</nobr> 14, 1891.</p>
      <p>Every missionary will have hard battles to ﬁght with self, and these combats will not become fewer. But if we
          are constantly growing in Christian experience, if we continue to look to Jesus in faith, strength will be
          given us for every emergency. All the powers and faculties of a regenerated nature must be brought into
          constant, daily exercise. Every day we shall have occasion to crucify self, to war against inclination and a
          perverse temperament that would draw the will in a wrong direction. The repose and triumph of victory are not
          yet ours, except as we by faith enter into the victory that Christ has gained for <nobr>us.—Letter</nobr> 4,
          1892.</p>
      <p>The promises of God accepted in genuine faith have a fragrant inﬂuence upon the life and the character, making
          the human agent to reﬂect the image of the Divine.... God works</p>
      <p>on His part..., imparting grace to the one who imparts in his life the graces given him in representing genuine
          sanctiﬁcation to the world in his own character.— Manuscript 45, 1900.</p>
