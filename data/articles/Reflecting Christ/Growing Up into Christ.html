    <h1>Growing Up into Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Psalm
          16:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Many have an idea that they must do some part of the work alone. They have trusted in Christ for the
          forgiveness of sin, but now they seek by their own efforts to live aright. But every such effort must fail.
          Jesus says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” Our growth in grace, our joy, our <nobr>usefulness—all</nobr>
          depend upon our union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, <nobr>hourly—by</nobr> abiding in
          <nobr>Him—that</nobr> we are to grow in grace....</p>
      <p>You gave yourself to God, to be His wholly, to serve and obey Him, and you took Christ as your Saviour. You
          could not yourself atone for your sins or change your heart; but having given yourself to God, you believe
          that He for Christ’s sake did all this for you. By faith you became Christ’s and by faith you are to grow up
          in <nobr>Him—by</nobr> giving and taking. You are to give <nobr>all—your</nobr> heart, your will, your
          <nobr>service—give</nobr> yourself to Him to obey all His requirements; and you must take
          <nobr>all—Christ,</nobr> the fullness of all blessing, to abide in your heart, to be your strength, your
          righteousness, your everlasting <nobr>helper—to</nobr> give you power to obey.</p>
      <p>Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very ﬁrst work. Let your prayer be, “Take me, O Lord,
          as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my
          work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day.
          Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by
          day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after
          the life of Christ.</p>
      <p>A life in Christ is a life of restfulness. There may be no ecstasy of feeling, but there should be an abiding,
          peaceful trust. Your hope is not in yourself; it is in Christ. Your weakness is united to His strength, your
          ignorance to His wisdom, your frailty to His enduring might. So you are not to look to yourself, not to let
          the mind dwell upon self, but look to Christ. Let the mind dwell upon His love, upon the beauty, the
          perfection, of His character. Christ in His <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> Christ in His humiliation, Christ in His
          purity and holiness, Christ in His matchless <nobr>love—this</nobr> is the subject for the soul’s
          contemplation. It is by loving Him, copying Him, depending wholly upon Him, that you are to be transformed
          into His <nobr>likeness.—Steps</nobr> to Christ, <nobr>69-71.</nobr></p>
