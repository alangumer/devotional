    <h1>God Gloriﬁed in Human Life</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we are labourers together with God; ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building. 1 Corinthians
          3:9.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the Saviour’s delight to see His followers colaborers with God, receiving bountifully all the means of
          <nobr>fruit-bearing,</nobr> and giving bountifully, as workers under Him. Christ gloriﬁed His Father by the
          fruit He bore, and the lives of His true followers will produce the same result. Receiving and imparting, His
          workers will produce much fruit. “Hitherto,” Christ said to His disciples, “have ye asked nothing in my name:
          ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.”</p>
      <p>The God of providence still walks among us, though His footsteps are not seen, though His positive and direct
          workings are not recognized or understood. The world in its human wisdom knows not God. The Lord designs that
          through human beings His glory, not the glory of men, shall be manifested. It is His light that shines through
          His agencies. Providence and revelation work in divine harmony, revealing God as ﬁrst, and last, and best in
          everything.</p>
      <p>Christ is drawing sinners to Himself by the cords of love, seeking to unite them to Himself, that they may be
          laborers together with God, not in pride and <nobr>self-sufﬁciency,</nobr> but in meekness and lowliness. When
          sinners are converted, God is gloriﬁed before the principalities and powers of heaven and earth. These
          converted ones are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. “Ye are my witnesses,” God says. By
          looking to Me you are to become transformed in character. By the manifestation of Christlike forbearance and
          love you are to reveal this transformation.</p>
      <p>By imparting to others the love and tenderness which God has so abundantly bestowed on us, we are to let our
          light shine. We should put every gift of God to the best possible use, making it a producer of good. To God we
          can give nothing which is not already His, but we can help the suffering ones around us. We can supply them
          with the necessities of this life, and at the same time speak to them of the wonderful love of God.</p>
      <p>Christ has identiﬁed His interests with those of His people. He has plainly stated that we can minister to Him
          by ministering to His suffering ones. Words of encouragement and cheer, spoken when the soul is sick and the
          pulse of courage is low, these are regarded by the Saviour as if spoken to Himself....</p>
      <p>We are to be in the world as a corrective inﬂuence, as salt that retains its savor. Among an unholy, impure,
          idolatrous generation, we are to be pure and holy, showing that the grace of Christ has power to restore in
          man the divine likeness. We are to exert a saving inﬂuence upon those in the <nobr>world.—The</nobr> Bible
          Echo, June 11, 1900.</p>
