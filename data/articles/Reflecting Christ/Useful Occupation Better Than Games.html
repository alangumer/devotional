    <h1>Useful Occupation Better Than Games</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. Psalm 18:32. Educate men and women
          to bring up their children free from false, fashionable practices, to teach them to be useful. The daughters
          should be educated under the mothers to do useful</strong></p>
      <p>labor, not merely indoor labor but <nobr>out-of-door</nobr> labor as well. Mothers could also train the sons,
          to a certain age, to do useful things indoors and <nobr>out-of-doors.</nobr></p>
      <p>There are plenty of necessary, useful things to do in our world that would make the
          <nobr>pleasure-amusement</nobr> exercise almost wholly unnecessary. Brain, bone, and muscle will acquire
          solidity and strength in using them to a purpose, doing good hard thinking, and in devising plans which shall
          train them [the youth] to develop powers of intellect and strength of the physical organs, which will be
          putting into practical use their <nobr>God-given</nobr> talents with which they may glorify God.</p>
      <p>This was plainly laid out before our health institution and our college as the forcible reason why they should
          be established among us; but as it was in the days of Noah and Lot, so it is in our time. Men have sought out
          many inventions and have widely departed from God’s purposes and His ways.</p>
      <p>I do not condemn the simple exercise of playing ball; but this, even in its simplicity, may be overdone. I
          shrink always from the almost sure result which follows in the wake of these amusements. It leads to an outlay
          of means that should be expended in bringing the light of truth to souls that are perishing out of Christ. The
          amusements and expenditures of means for <nobr>self-pleasing,</nobr> which lead on step by step to
          <nobr>self-glorifying,</nobr> and the educating in these games for pleasure, produce a love and passion for
          such things that is not favorable to the perfection of Christian character....</p>
      <p>Suffering humanity needs help everywhere. The students may win their way to hearts by speaking words in season,
          buy doing favors for those who need even physical labor. This will... bring a consciousness of the approval of
          God. It will be putting the talents, entrusted to you for wise improvement, to the exchangers....</p>
      <p>There are healthful methods of exercise that may be planned which will be beneﬁcial to both soul and body....
          It is our duty ever to seek to do good in the use of the muscles and</p>
      <p>brain God has given to youth, that they may be useful to others, making their labors lighter,</p>
      <p>... turning the minds of the students from fun and frolic which often carries them beyond the dignity of
          manhood and womanhood.... The Lord would have the mind elevated, seeking</p>
      <p>higher, nobler channels of <nobr>usefulness.—Selected</nobr> Messages <nobr>2:321-324.</nobr></p>
