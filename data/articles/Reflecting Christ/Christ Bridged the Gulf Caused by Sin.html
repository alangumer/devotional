    <h1>Christ Bridged the Gulf Caused by Sin</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
          not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16.</strong></p>
      <p>Sin originated in <nobr>self-seeking.</nobr> Lucifer, the covering cherub, desired to be ﬁrst in heaven. He
          sought to gain control of heavenly beings, to draw them away from their Creator, and to win their homage to
          himself. Therefore he misrepresented God, attributing to Him the desire for <nobr>self-exaltation.</nobr> With
          his own evil characteristics he sought to invest the loving Creator. Thus he deceived angels. Thus he deceived
          men. He led them to doubt the word of God, and to distrust His goodness. Because God is a God of justice and
          terrible majesty, Satan caused them to look upon Him as severe and unforgiving. Thus he drew men to join him
          in rebellion against God, and the night of woe settled down upon the world.</p>
      <p>The earth was dark through misapprehension of God. That the gloomy shadows might be lightened, that the world
          might be brought back to God, Satan’s deceptive power was to be broken. This could not be done by force. The
          exercise of force is contrary to the principles of God’s government; He desires only the service of love; and
          love cannot be commanded; it cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is love awakened. To know God
          is to love Him; His character must be manifested in contrast to the character of Satan. This work only one
          Being in all the universe could do. Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it
          known. Upon the world’s dark night the Sun of Righteousness must rise, “with healing in his wings” (Malachi
          4:2).</p>
      <p>The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a
          revelation of “the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal” (Romans 16:25, R.V.). It was
          an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God’s throne. From the
          beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of
          the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to
          meet the terrible emergency....</p>
      <p>Since Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is acquainted with our trials, and sympathizes with our
          griefs. Every son and daughter of Adam may understand that our Creator is the friend of sinners. For in every
          doctrine of grace, every promise of joy, every deed of love, every divine attraction presented in the
          Saviour’s life on earth, we see “God with <nobr>us.”—The</nobr> Desire of Ages, <nobr>21-24.</nobr></p>
