      <p><strong>The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth. Exodus
          34:6.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord is soon to come. The angels are holding the four winds, in order that God’s people may do their
          <nobr>long-neglected</nobr> work. We are not half awake to what might be done in our world....</p>
      <p><nobr>House-to-house</nobr> work is one very successful way of reaching souls. But it is not the only way that
          God has provided for the advancement of His work. Decided proclamations of truth are to be made. But in regard
          to this line of work I am instructed to say to our people: Be guarded. In bearing the message make no personal
          thrusts at other churches.... Let us</p>
      <p>be careful of our words. Let not our ministers follow their own impulses in denouncing and exposing the
          mysteries of iniquity. Upon these themes often silence is eloquence.</p>
      <p>Many are deceived. Speak the truth in tones and words of love. Let Christ be exalted. Keep to the afﬁrmative of
          truth. Never leave the straight path God has marked out, for the purpose of giving someone a thrust. That
          thrust may do much harm and no good. It may quench conviction in many minds. Let the truth tell the story of
          the inconsistency of those in error.</p>
      <p>People cannot be expected to see at once the advantage of truth over the error they have cherished. The best
          way to expose the fallacy of error is to present the evidence of truth. This is the greatest rebuke that can
          be given to error. Dispel the cloud of darkness resting on minds by reﬂecting the bright light of the Sun of
          Righteousness.</p>
      <p>You may have opportunity to speak to other churches. In improving these opportunities, remember the words of
          the Saviour, “Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” Do not arouse the malignity of the
          enemy by making denunciatory speeches. Thus you would close doors against the entrance of truth.
          <nobr>Clear-cut</nobr> messages are to be borne. But guard against arousing antagonism. Restrain all harsh
          expressions.</p>
      <p>There are many souls to be saved. In words and deed be wise unto salvation, representing Christ to all with
          whom you come in contact. Let all see that your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and
          goodwill to men. Wonderful are the results we shall see if we enter the work imbued with the Spirit of Christ.
          If we carry the Word forward, in righteousness, mercy, and love, help will come in our necessity. Truth will
          triumph and bear away the <nobr>victory.—Paciﬁc</nobr> Union Recorder, October 23, 1902.</p>
