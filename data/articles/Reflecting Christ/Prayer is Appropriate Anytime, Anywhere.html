    <h1>Prayer is Appropriate Anytime, Anywhere</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. John 14:14.</strong></p>
      <p>There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up a petition to God. There is nothing that can
          prevent us from lifting up our hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the
          midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God and plead for divine guidance, as did
          Nehemiah when he made his request before King Artaxerxes. A closet of communion may be found wherever we are.
          We should have the door of the heart open continually and our invitation going up that Jesus may come and
          abide as a heavenly guest in the soul.</p>
      <p>Although there may be a tainted, corrupted atmosphere around us, we need not breathe its miasma, but may live
          in the pure air of heaven. We may close every door to impure imaginings and unholy thoughts by lifting the
          soul into the presence of God through sincere prayer. Those whose hearts are open to receive the support and
          blessing of God will walk in a holier atmosphere than that of earth and will have constant communion with
          heaven.</p>
      <p>We need to have more distinct views of Jesus and a fuller comprehension of the value of eternal realities. The
          beauty of holiness is to ﬁll the hearts of God’s children; and that this may be accomplished, we should seek
          for divine disclosures of heavenly things.</p>
      <p>Let the soul be drawn out and upward, that God may grant us a breath of the heavenly atmosphere. We may keep so
          near to God that in every unexpected trial our thoughts will turn to Him as naturally as the ﬂower turns to
          the sun.</p>
      <p>Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you
          cannot weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children. “The
          Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy” (James 5:11). His heart of love is touched by our sorrows and even
          by our utterances of them. Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to
          bear, for He holds up worlds. He rules over all the affairs of the universe.</p>
      <p>Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There is no chapter in our
          experience too dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difﬁcult for Him to unravel.... The relations
          between God and each soul are as distinct and full as</p>
      <p>though there were not another soul upon the earth to share His watchcare, not another soul for whom He gave His
          beloved <nobr>Son.—Steps</nobr> to Christ, 99, 100.</p>
