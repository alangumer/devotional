    <h1>Sanctiﬁed By Faith And Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Herein is my Father gloriﬁed, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. John
          15:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Many shrink from such a life as our Saviour lived. They feel that it requires too great a sacriﬁce to imitate
          the Pattern, to bring forth fruit in good works, and then patiently endure the pruning of God that they may
          bring forth more fruit. But when the Christian regards himself as only a humble instrument in the hands of
          Christ, and endeavors to faithfully perform every duty, relying upon the help which God has promised, then he
          will wear the yoke of Christ and ﬁnd it easy; then he will bear burdens for Christ, and pronounce them light.
          He can look up with courage and with conﬁdence, and say, “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that
          he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him” (2 Timothy 1:12).</p>
      <p>If we meet obstacles in our path, and faithfully overcome them; if we encounter opposition and reproach, and in
          Christ’s name gain the victory; if we bear responsibilities and discharge our duties in the spirit of our
          <nobr>Master—then,</nobr> indeed, we gain a precious knowledge of His faithfulness and power. We no longer
          depend upon the experience of others, for we have the witness in ourselves. Like the Samaritans of old, we can
          say, “We have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world” (John
          4:42).</p>
      <p>The more we contemplate the character of Christ, and the more we experience of His saving power, the more
          keenly shall we realize our own weakness and imperfection, and the more earnestly shall we look to Him as our
          strength and our Redeemer.... By faith in</p>
      <p>Christ and obedience to the law of God we may be sanctiﬁed, and thus obtain a ﬁtness for the society of holy
          angels and the <nobr>white-robed</nobr> redeemed ones in the kingdom of glory.</p>
      <p>It is not only the privilege but the duty of every Christian to maintain a close union with Christ and to have
          a rich experience in the things of God. Then his life will be fruitful in good works....</p>
      <p>When we read the lives of men who have been eminent for their piety we often regard their experiences and
          attainments as far beyond our reach. But this is not the case. Christ died for all; and we are assured in His
          Word that He is more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask than are earthly parents to give good
          gifts to their children.</p>
      <p>The prophets and apostles did not perfect Christian character by a miracle. They used the means which God had
          placed within their reach; and all who will put forth the same effort will secure the same
          <nobr>results.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>82-84.</nobr></p>
