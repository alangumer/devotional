    <h1>The Pure in Heart to Reﬂect Christ</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his
          <nobr>friend.—Proverbs</nobr> 22:11, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Into the City of God there will enter nothing that deﬁles. All who are to be dwellers there will here have
          become pure in heart. In one who is learning of Jesus, there will be manifest a growing distaste for careless
          manners, unseemly language, and coarse thought. When Christ abides in the heart, there will be purity and
          reﬁnement of thought and manner.</p>
      <p>But the words of Jesus, “Blessed are the pure in heart,” have a deeper <nobr>meaning—not</nobr> merely pure in
          the sense in which the world understands purity, free from that which is sensual, pure from lust, but true in
          the hidden purposes and motives of the soul, free from pride and <nobr>self-seeking,</nobr> humble, unselﬁsh,
          childlike....</p>
      <p>To hearts that have become puriﬁed through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, all is changed. These can know
          God. Moses was hid in the cleft of the rock when the glory of the Lord was revealed to him; and it is when we
          are hid in Christ that we behold the love of God.</p>
      <p>“He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend” (Proverbs 22:11). By
          faith we behold Him here and now. In our daily experience we discern His goodness and compassion in the
          manifestation of His providence.... The pure in heart</p>
      <p>see God in a new and endearing relation, as their Redeemer; and while they discern the purity and loveliness of
          His character, they long to reﬂect His image. They see Him as a Father longing to embrace a repenting son, and
          their hearts are ﬁlled with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
      <p>The pure in heart discern the Creator in the works of His mighty hand, in the things of beauty that comprise
          the universe. In His Written Word they read in clearer lines the revelation of His mercy, His goodness, and
          His grace....</p>
      <p>The beauty and preciousness of truth, which are undiscerned by the <nobr>worldly-wise,</nobr> are constantly
          unfolding to those who have a trusting, childlike desire to know and to do the will of God. We discern the
          truth by becoming, ourselves, partakers of the divine nature.</p>
      <p>The pure in heart live as in the visible presence of God during the time He apportions them in this world. And
          they will also see Him face to face in the future, immortal state, as did Adam when he walked and talked with
          God in Eden. “Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face” (1 Corinthians
          <nobr>13:12).—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, <nobr>24-27.</nobr></p>
