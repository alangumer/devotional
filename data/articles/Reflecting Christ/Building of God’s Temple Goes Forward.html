    <h1>Building of God’s Temple Goes Forward</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but <nobr>fellow-citizens</nobr> with the
          saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
          Christ himself being the chief corner stone. Ephesians 2:19, 20.</strong></p>
      <p>The enemy of righteousness left nothing undone in his effort to stop the work committed to the Lord’s builders.
          But God “left not himself without witness” (Acts 14:17). Workers were raised up who ably defended the faith
          once delivered to the saints. History bears record to the fortitude and heroism of these men. Like the
          apostles, many of them fell at their post, but the building of the temple went steadily forward. The workmen
          were slain, but the work advanced.</p>
      <p>The Waldenses, John Wycliffe, Huss and Jerome, Martin Luther and Zwingli, Cranmer, Latimer, and Knox, the
          Huguenots, John and Charles Wesley, and a host of others brought to the foundation material that will endure
          throughout eternity. And in later years those who have so nobly endeavored to promote the circulation of God’s
          Word, and those who by their service in heathen lands have prepared the way for the proclamation of the last
          great <nobr>message—these</nobr> also have helped to rear the structure.</p>
      <p>Through the ages that have passed since the days of the apostles, the building of God’s temple has never
          ceased. We may look back through the centuries and see the living stones of which it is composed gleaming like
          jets of light through the darkness of error and superstition. Throughout eternity these precious jewels will
          shine with increasing luster, testifying to the power of the truth of God. The ﬂashing light of these polished
          stones reveals the strong contrast between light and darkness, between the gold of truth and the dross of
          error.</p>
      <p>Paul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived since then, have acted their part in the
          building of the temple. But the structure is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work to
          do, a part to act. We are to bring to the foundation material that will stand the test of
          <nobr>ﬁre—gold,</nobr> silver, and precious stones, “polished after the similitude of a palace” (Psalm
          144:12). To those who thus build for God, Paul speaks words of encouragement... : “If any man’s work abide
          which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.” ... The Christian who faithfully presents the word
          of life, leading men and women into the way of holiness and peace, is bringing to the foundation material that
          will endure, and in the kingdom of God He will be honored as a wise <nobr>builder.—The</nobr> Acts of the
          Apostles, 598, 599.</p>
