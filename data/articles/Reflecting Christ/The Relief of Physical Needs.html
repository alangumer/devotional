      <p><strong>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of
          death light is sprung up. Matthew 4:16.</strong></p>
      <p>There are many now in the shadow of death who need to be instructed in the truths of the gospel. Nearly the
          whole world is lying in wickedness. To every believer in Christ words of hope have been given for those who
          sit in darkness....</p>
      <p>Earnest, devoted young people are needed to enter the work as nurses.... The Lord wants</p>
      <p>wise men and women, who can act in the capacity of nurses, to comfort and help the sick and suffering. O that
          all who are afﬂicted might be ministered to by Christian physicians and nurses who could help them to place
          their weary, <nobr>pain-racked</nobr> bodies in the care of the Great Healer, in faith looking to him for
          restoration! If through judicious ministration the patient is led to give his soul to Christ and to bring his
          thoughts into obedience to the will of God, a great victory is gained.</p>
      <p>In our daily ministrations we see many careworn, sorrowful faces. What does the sorrow on these faces show? It
          shows the need of the soul for the peace of Christ. Men and women, longing for something they have not, have
          sought to supply their want at earth’s broken cisterns. Let these hear a voice saying, “Ho, every one that
          thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” Weary souls, seeking you know not what, come to the water of life. All
          heaven is yearning over you. “Come to me, that ye might have life.”</p>
      <p>There are many lines of work to be carried forward by the missionary nurse. There are opportunities for
          <nobr>well-trained</nobr> nurses to go into homes and there endeavor to awaken an interest in the truth. In
          almost every community there are large numbers who will not listen to the teaching of God’s Word or attend any
          religious service. If these are reached by the gospel, it must be carried to their homes. Often the relief of
          their physical needs is the only avenue by which they can be approached.</p>
      <p>Missionary nurses who care for the sick and relieve the distress of the poor will ﬁnd many opportunities to
          pray with them, to read to them from God’s Word, and to speak of the Saviour. They can pray with and for the
          helpless ones who have not strength of will to control the appetites that passion has degraded. They can bring
          a ray of hope into the lives of the defeated and disheartened. The revelation of unselﬁsh love, manifested in
          acts of disinterested kindness, will make it easier for these suffering ones to believe in the love of
          <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 24, 1914.</p>
