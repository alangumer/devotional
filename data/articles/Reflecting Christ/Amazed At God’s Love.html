    <h1>Amazed At God’s Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day. Revelation 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>The Lord’s day mentioned by John was the Sabbath, the day on which Jehovah rested after the great work of
          creation, and which He blessed and sanctiﬁed because He had rested upon it. The Sabbath was as sacredly
          observed by John upon the Isle of Patmos as when he was among the people, preaching upon that day. By the
          barren rocks surrounding him, John was reminded of rocky Horeb, and how, when God spoke His law to the people
          there, He said, “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8).</p>
      <p>The Son of God spoke to Moses from the mountaintop. God made the rocks His sanctuary. His temple was the
          everlasting hills. The Divine Legislator descended upon the rocky mountain to speak His law in the hearing of
          all the people, that they might be impressed by the grand and awful exhibition of His power and glory, and
          fear to transgress His commandments. God spoke His law amid thunders and lightnings and the thick cloud upon
          the top of the mountain, and His voice was as the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud. The law of Jehovah was
          unchangeable, and the tablets upon which He wrote that law were solid rock, signifying the immutability of His
          precepts. Rocky Horeb became a sacred place to all who loved and revered the law of God.</p>
      <p>While John was contemplating the scenes of Horeb, the Spirit of Him who sanctiﬁed the seventh day came upon
          him. He contemplated the sin of Adam in transgressing the divine law, and the fearful result of that
          transgression. The inﬁnite love of God, in giving His Son to redeem a lost race, seemed too great for language
          to express. As he presents it in his Epistle he calls upon the church and the world to behold it. “Behold,
          what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the
          world knoweth us not, because it knew him not” (1 John 3:1).</p>
      <p>It was a mystery to John that God could give His Son to die for rebellious man. And he was lost in amazement
          that the plan of salvation, devised at such a cost to Heaven, should be refused by those for whom the inﬁnite
          sacriﬁce had been made....</p>
      <p>It is no light matter to sin against God, to set the perverse will of man in opposition to the will of his
          Maker. It is for the best interest of men, even in this world, to obey God’s commandments. And it is surely
          for their eternal interest to submit to God, and be at peace with Him.... God made him a free moral agent, to
          obey or disobey. The reward of everlasting</p>
      <p><nobr>life—an</nobr> eternal weight of <nobr>glory—is</nobr> promised to those who do God’s
          <nobr>will.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>74-76.</nobr></p>
