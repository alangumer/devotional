    <h1>Justiﬁcation By Faith —Our Only Hope</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the
          propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 1 John 2:1,
          2.</strong></p>
      <p>As the penitent sinner, contrite before God, discerns Christ’s atonement in his behalf, and accepts this
          atonement as his only hope in this life and the future life, his sins are pardoned. This is justiﬁcation by
          faith. Every believing soul is to conform his will entirely to God’s will, and keep in a state of repentance
          and contrition, exercising faith in the atoning merits of the Redeemer and advancing from strength to
          strength, from glory to glory.</p>
      <p>Pardon and justiﬁcation are one and the same thing. Through faith, the believer passes from the position of a
          rebel, a child of sin and Satan, to the position of a loyal subject of Christ Jesus, not because of an
          inherent goodness, but because Christ receives him as His child by adoption. The sinner receives the
          forgiveness of his sins, because these sins are borne by his Substitute and Surety. The Lord speaks to His
          heavenly Father, saying: “This is My child. I reprieve him from the condemnation of death, giving him My life
          insurance <nobr>policy—eternal</nobr><nobr>life—because</nobr> I have taken his place and have suffered for
          his sins. He is even My beloved son.” Thus man, pardoned, and clothed with the beautiful garments of Christ’s
          righteousness, stands faultless before God.</p>
      <p>The sinner may err, but he is not cast off without mercy. His only hope, however, is repentance toward God and
          faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the Father’s prerogative to forgive our transgressions and sins, because
          Christ has taken upon Himself our guilt and reprieved us, imputing to us His own righteousness. His sacriﬁce
          satisﬁes fully the demands of justice.</p>
      <p>Justiﬁcation is the opposite of condemnation. God’s boundless mercy is exercised toward those who are wholly
          undeserving. He forgives transgressions and sins for the sake of Jesus, who has become the propitiation for
          our sins. Through faith in Christ, the guilty transgressor is brought into favor with God and into the strong
          hope of life eternal.— The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 1070, 1071.</p>
      <p>The sinner is justiﬁed through the merits of Jesus, and this is God’s acknowledgment of the perfection of the
          ransom paid for man. That Christ was obedient even unto the death of the cross is a pledge of the repenting
          sinner’s acceptance with the <nobr>Father.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, July 4, 1892.</p>
