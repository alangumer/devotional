    <h1>Fathers to Spend Time with Children</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of
          the Lord. Ephesians 6:4.</strong></p>
      <p>While we have dwelt upon the importance of the mother’s work and mission, we would not lightly pass over the
          duty and responsibility of the husband and father in the training of his children. His efforts should be in
          harmony with those of the <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> mother. He should manifest his love and respect for her as
          the woman he has chosen and the mother of his children....</p>
      <p>Fathers should ... mingle with the children, sympathizing with them in their little troubles, binding them to
          their hearts by the strong bonds of love, and establishing such an inﬂuence over their expanding minds that
          their counsel will be regarded as sacred....</p>
      <p>Upon returning home from his business he should ﬁnd it a pleasant change to spend some time with his children.
          He may take them into the garden, and show them the opening buds, and the varied tints of the blooming ﬂowers.
          Through such mediums he may give them the most important lessons concerning the Creator, by opening before
          them the great book of nature, where the love of God is expressed in every tree, and ﬂower, and blade of
          grass. He may impress upon their minds the fact that if God cares so much for the trees and ﬂowers, He will
          care much more for the creatures formed in His image. He may lead them early to understand that God wants
          children to be lovely, not with artiﬁcial adornment, but with beauty of character, the charms of kindness and
          affection, which will make their hearts bound with joy and happiness.</p>
      <p>Parents may do much to connect their children with God by encouraging them to love the things of nature which
          He has given them, and to recognize the hand of the Giver in all they receive. The soil of the heart may thus
          early be prepared for casting in the precious seeds of truth, which in due time will spring up and bear a rich
          harvest. Fathers, the golden hours which you might spend in getting a thorough knowledge of the temperament
          and character of your children, and the best methods of dealing with their young minds, are ...</p>
      <p><nobr>precious.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, December 6, 1877.</p>
      <p>The father’s duty to his children should be one of his ﬁrst interests. It should not be set aside for the sake
          of acquiring a fortune, or of gaining a high position in the world. In fact, those very conditions of afﬂuence
          and honor frequently separate a man from his family, and cut off his inﬂuence from them more than anything
          else. If the father would have his children develop harmonious characters, and be an honor to him and a
          blessing to the world, he has a special work to <nobr>do.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, December 20,
          1877.</p>
