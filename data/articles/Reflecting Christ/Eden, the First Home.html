    <h1>Eden, the First Home</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Lord God ... made ... a woman, and brought her unto the man.... Therefore</strong></p>
      <p>shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one ﬂesh.
          Genesis <nobr>2:22-24.</nobr></p>
      <p>God celebrated the ﬁrst marriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of the universe.
          “Marriage is honourable” (Hebrews 13:4); it was one of the ﬁrst gifts of God to man, and it is one of the two
          institutions that, after the Fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise. When the divine
          principles are recognized and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and
          happiness of the race, it provides for man’s social needs, it elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the
          moral nature....</p>
      <p>The home of our ﬁrst parents was to be a pattern for other homes as their children should go forth to occupy
          the earth. That home, beautiﬁed by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace.... God placed Adam in a
          garden. This was his dwelling.... In the</p>
      <p>surroundings of the holy pair was a lesson for all <nobr>time—that</nobr> true happiness is found, not in the
          indulgence of pride and luxury, but in communion with God through His created works. If men would give less
          attention to the artiﬁcial, and would cultivate greater simplicity, they would come far nearer to answering
          the purpose of God in their creation. Pride and ambition are never satisﬁed, but those who are truly wise will
          ﬁnd substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources of enjoyment that God has placed within the reach of
          all.</p>
      <p>To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden, “to dress it and to keep it.” Their occupation
          was not wearisome, but pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to occupy his
          mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In mental and physical activity Adam found one of
          the highest pleasures of his holy existence.... The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care
          of God</p>
      <p>but students receiving instruction from the <nobr>all-wise</nobr> Creator.... The order and harmony of</p>
      <p>creation spoke to them of inﬁnite wisdom and power. They were ever discovering some attraction that ﬁlled their
          hearts with deeper love and called forth fresh expressions of gratitude.</p>
      <p>So long as they remained loyal to the divine law, their capacity to know, to enjoy, and to love would
          continually increase. They would be constantly gaining new treasures of knowledge, discovering fresh springs
          of happiness, and obtaining clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the immeasurable, unfailing love of
          <nobr>God.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, <nobr>46-51.</nobr></p>
