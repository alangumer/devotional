      <p><strong>When he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. John
          16:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the promise belongs as much to us as to the ﬁrst
          disciples. But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many who profess to believe and
          claim the Lord’s promises; they talk about Christ and the Holy Spirit; yet they receive no beneﬁt, because
          they do not surrender their souls to the guidance and control of divine agencies.</p>
      <p>We cannot use the Holy Spirit; the Spirit is to use us. Through the Spirit, God works in His people “to will
          and to do of his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13). But many will not submit to be led. They want to manage
          themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who
          watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all
          other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to
          supply every soul according to the capacity to receive.</p>
      <p>The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. Those only who are thus taught of God,
          those only who possess the inward working of the Spirit, and in whose life the <nobr>Christ-life</nobr> is
          manifested, can stand as true representatives of the Saviour.</p>
      <p>God takes men as they are, and educates them for His service, if they will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit
          of God, received into the soul, quickens all its faculties. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the mind
          that is devoted unreservedly to God develops harmoniously, and is strengthened to comprehend and fulﬁll the
          requirements of God. The weak, vacillating character becomes changed to one of strength and
          steadfastness.</p>
      <p>Continual devotion establishes so close a relation between Jesus and His disciples that the Christian becomes
          like his Master in character. He has clearer, broader views. His discernment is more penetrative, his judgment
          better balanced. So quickened is he by the <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power of the Sun of Righteousness, that he
          is enabled to bear much fruit to the glory of God....</p>
      <p>Of what avail would it be to us that the <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son of God humbled Himself, endured the
          temptations of the wily foe, and died, the just for the unjust, if the Spirit had not been given as a
          constant, working, regenerating agent, to make effectual in each individual case what has been wrought out by
          the world’s <nobr>Redeemer?—Gospel</nobr> Workers, <nobr>284-286.</nobr></p>
