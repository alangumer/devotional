    <h1>“Pure Religion” and “My Neighbor” Deﬁned</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Pure religion and undeﬁled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
          their afﬂiction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. James 1:27.</strong></p>
      <p>What is pure religion? Christ has told us that pure religion is the exercise of pity, sympathy, and love in the
          home, in the church, and in the world. This is the kind of religion to teach to the children, and is the
          genuine article. Teach them that they are not to center their thoughts upon themselves, but that wherever
          there is human need and suffering, there is a ﬁeld for missionary work....</p>
      <p>There are many who ask, as did the lawyer, “Who is my neighbor?” The answer comes down to us in the
          circumstances that happened near Jericho, when the priest and the Levite passed by on the other side, and left
          the poor, bruised, and wounded stranger to be taken care of by the good Samaritan. Everyone who is in
          suffering need is our neighbor. Every straying son and daughter of Adam, who has been ensnared by the enemy of
          souls, and bound in the slavery of wrong habits that blight the <nobr>God-given</nobr> manhood or womanhood,
          is my neighbor....</p>
      <p>Would that children might be educated from their babyhood, through their childhood and youth, to understand
          what is the missionary work to be done right around them. Let the home be made a place for religious
          instruction. Let parents become mouthpieces of the Lord God of Israel, to teach the precepts of true
          Christianity, and let them be examples of what the principles of love can make men and women.</p>
      <p>We are to think and care for others who need our love, our tenderness, and care. We should ever remember that
          we are representatives of Christ, and that we are to share the blessings that He gives, not with those who can
          recompense us again, but with those who will appreciate the gifts that will supply their temporal and
          spiritual necessities. Those who give feasts for the purpose of helping those who have but little pleasure,
          for the purpose of bringing brightness into their dreary lives, for the purpose of relieving their poverty and
          distress, are acting unselﬁshly and in harmony with the instruction of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Review and
          Herald, November 12, 1895.</p>
      <p>Good deeds are the fruit that Christ requires us to bear: kind words, deeds of benevolence, of tender regard
          for the poor, the needy, the afﬂicted. When hearts sympathize with hearts burdened with discouragement and
          grief, when the hand dispenses to the needy, when the naked are clothed, the stranger made welcome to a seat
          in your parlor and a place in your heart, angels are coming very near, and an answering strain is responded to
          in <nobr>heaven.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 2:25.</p>
