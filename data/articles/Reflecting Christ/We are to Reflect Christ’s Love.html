    <h1>We are to Reﬂect Christ’s Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. John
          20:21.</strong></p>
      <p>We should earnestly seek to know and appreciate the truth, that we may present it to others as it is in Jesus.
          We need to have a correct estimate of the value of our own souls; then we would not be as reckless in regard
          to our course of action as at present. We would seek most earnestly to know God’s way; we would work an
          opposite direction from selﬁshness, and our constant prayer would be that we might have the mind of Christ,
          that we might be molded and fashioned after His likeness. It is in looking to Jesus and beholding His
          loveliness, having our eyes steadfastly ﬁxed upon Him, that we become changed into His image. He will give
          grace to all that keep His way, and do His will, and walk in truth....</p>
      <p>I beseech you whose names are registered on the church book as worthy members, to be indeed worthy, through the
          virtue of Christ. Mercy and truth and the love of God are promised to the humble and contrite soul....</p>
      <p>All heaven is ﬁlled with amazement, that when this love, so broad, so deep, so rich and full, is presented to
          men who have known the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, they are so indifferent, so cold and unmoved....</p>
      <p>The inﬁnite treasures of truth have been accumulating from age to age. No representation could adequately
          impress us with the extent, the richness, of these vast resources. They are awaiting the demand of those who
          appreciate them. These gems of truth are to be gathered up by God’s remnant people, to be given by them to the
          world; but <nobr>self-conﬁdence</nobr> and obduracy of soul refuse the blessed treasure. “God so loved the
          world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
          everlasting life.” Such love cannot be measured, neither can it be expressed. John calls upon the world to
          behold “what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.” It is
          a love that passeth knowledge.</p>
      <p>In the fullness of the sacriﬁce, nothing was withheld. Jesus gave Himself. God designs that His people shall
          love one another as Christ loved us. They are to educate and train the soul for this love. They are to reﬂect
          this love in their own character, to reﬂect it to the world. Each should look upon this as his work....
          Christ’s fullness is to be presented to the world by</p>
      <p>those who have become partakers of His grace. They are to do that for Christ which Christ did for the
          <nobr>Father—represent</nobr> His <nobr>character.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 23, 1890.</p>
