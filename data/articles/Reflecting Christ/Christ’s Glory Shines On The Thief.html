    <h1>Christ’s Glory Shines On The Thief</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. Luke 23:42.</strong></p>
      <p>To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of comfort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief.
          Both the men who were cruciﬁed with Jesus had at ﬁrst railed upon Him; and one under his suffering only became
          more desperate and deﬁant.</p>
      <p>But not so with his companion. This man was not a hardened criminal; he had been led astray by evil
          associations, but he was less guilty than many of those who stood beside the cross reviling the Saviour. He
          had seen and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by His teaching, but he had been turned away from Him by the
          priests and rulers. Seeking to stiﬂe conviction, he had plunged deeper and deeper into sin, until he was
          arrested, tried as a criminal, and condemned to die on the cross.</p>
      <p>In the judgment hall and on the way to Calvary he had been in company with Jesus. He had heard Pilate declare,
          “I ﬁnd no fault in Him” (John 19:4). He had marked His Godlike bearing, and His pitying forgiveness of His
          tormentors. On the cross he sees the many great religionists shoot out the tongue with scorn, and ridicule the
          Lord Jesus. He sees the wagging heads. He hears the upbraiding speeches taken up by his companion in guilt:
          “If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.”</p>
      <p>Among the passersby he hears many defending Jesus. He hears them repeat His words, and tell of His works. The
          conviction comes back to him that this is the Christ.... And now,</p>
      <p>all <nobr>sin-polluted</nobr> as it is, his life history is about to close. “And we indeed justly,” he moans;
          “for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.” ...</p>
      <p>Strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls to mind all he has heard of Jesus, how He has healed the sick
          and pardoned sin.... The Holy Spirit illuminates his mind, and little</p>
      <p>by little the chain of evidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the cross, he
          sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the
          helpless, dying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour. “Lord, remember me,” he cries, “when thou comest into
          thy kingdom.”</p>
      <p>Quickly the answer came. Soft and melodious the tone, full of love, compassion, and power the words: Verily I
          say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in paradise....</p>
      <p>With longing heart He has listened for some expression of faith from His disciples....</p>
      <p>How grateful then to the Saviour was the utterance of faith and love from the dying <nobr>thief!—The</nobr>
          Desire of Ages, 749, 750.</p>
