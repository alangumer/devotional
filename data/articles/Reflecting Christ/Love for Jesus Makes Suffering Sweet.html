    <h1>Love for Jesus Makes Suffering Sweet</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Our light afﬂiction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight
          of glory. 2 Corinthians 4:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus does not present to His followers the hope of attaining earthly glory and riches, and of having a life
          free from trial, but He presents to them the privilege of walking with their Master in the paths of
          <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and reproach, because the world knows them not....</p>
      <p>In an unpitying confederacy, evil men and evil angels arrayed themselves against the Prince of Peace. Though
          His every word and act breathed of divine compassion, His unlikeness to the world provoked the bitterest
          hostility....</p>
      <p>Between righteousness and sin, love and hatred, truth and falsehood, there is an irrepressible conﬂict. When
          one presents the love of Christ and the beauty of holiness, he is drawing away the subjects of Satan’s
          kingdom, and the prince of evil is aroused to resist it....</p>
      <p>As men seek to come into harmony with God, they will ﬁnd that the offense of the cross has not ceased.
          Principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places are arrayed against all who yield obedience to the
          law of heaven. Therefore, so far from causing grief, persecution should bring joy to the disciples of Christ,
          for it is an evidence that they are following in the steps of their Master.</p>
      <p>While the Lord has not promised His people exemption from trials, He has promised that which is far better. He
          has said, “As thy days, so shall thy strength be” (Deuteronomy 33:25).... If you are called to go through the
          ﬁery furnace for His sake, Jesus will be by your</p>
      <p>side even as He was with the faithful three in Babylon. Those who love their Redeemer will rejoice at every
          opportunity of sharing with Him humiliation and reproach. The love they bear their Lord makes suffering for
          His sake sweet....</p>
      <p>They follow Christ through sore conﬂicts; they endure <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and experience bitter
          disappointments; but their painful experience teaches them the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it
          with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ’s sufferings, they are destined to be partakers of His glory.</p>
      <p>In holy vision the prophet saw the triumph of the people of God. He says, “I saw as it were a sea of glass
          mingled with ﬁre: and them that had gotten the victory ..., stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of
          God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and
          marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.” (Revelation 15:2, <nobr>3).—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of
          Blessing, <nobr>29-31.</nobr></p>
