    <h1>Love Is Shown By Willing Obedience</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land. Isaiah 1:19.</strong></p>
      <p>The character of the Christian is shown by his daily life. Said Christ, “Every good tree bringeth forth good
          fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit” (Matthew 7:17). Our Saviour compares Himself to a vine,
          of which His followers are the branches. He plainly declares that all who would be His disciples must bring
          forth fruit; and then He shows how they may become fruitful branches. “Abide in me, and I in you. As the
          branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me” (John
          15:4).</p>
      <p>The apostle Paul describes the fruit which the Christian is to bear. He says that it “is in all goodness and
          righteousness and truth” (Ephesians 5:9). And again, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
          longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance” (Galatians 5:22, 23). These precious graces
          are but the principles of God’s law carried out in the life.</p>
      <p>The law of God is the only true standard of moral perfection. That law was practically exempliﬁed in the life
          of Christ. He says of Himself, “I have kept my Father’s commandments” (John 15:10). Nothing short of this
          obedience will meet the requirements of God’s Word. “He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to
          walk, even as he walked” (1 John 2:6). We cannot plead that we are unable to do this, for we have the
          assurance, “My grace is sufﬁcient for thee” (2 Corinthians 12:9). As we look into the divine mirror, the law
          of God, we see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and our own lost condition as transgressors. But by repentance
          and faith we are justiﬁed before God, and through divine grace enabled to render obedience to His
          commandments.</p>
      <p>Those who have genuine love for God will manifest an earnest desire to know His will and to do it.... The child
          who loves his parents will show that love by willing obedience; but</p>
      <p>the selﬁsh, ungrateful child seeks to do as little as possible for his parents, while he at the same time
          desires to enjoy all the privileges granted to the obedient and faithful.</p>
      <p>The same difference is seen among those who profess to be children of God. Many who know that they are the
          objects of His love and care, and who desire to receive His blessing, take no delight in doing His will. They
          regard God’s claims upon them as an unpleasant restraint, His commandments as a grievous yoke. But he who is
          truly seeking for holiness of heart and life delights in the law of God, and mourns only that he falls so far
          short of meeting its <nobr>requirements.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, 80, 81.</p>
