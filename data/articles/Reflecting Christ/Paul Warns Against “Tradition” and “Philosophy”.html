    <h1>Paul Warns Against “Tradition” and “Philosophy”</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
          rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. Colossians 2:8.</strong></p>
      <p>Surrounded by the practices and inﬂuences of heathenism, the Colossian believers were in danger of being drawn
          away from the simplicity of the gospel, and Paul, in warning them against this, pointed them to Christ as the
          only safe guide.... “As ye have therefore received</p>
      <p>Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
          been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.” ...</p>
      <p>Christ had foretold that deceivers would arise, through whose inﬂuence “iniquity” should “abound,” and “the
          love of many” should “wax cold” (Matthew 24:12). He had warned the disciples that the church would be in more
          danger from this evil than from the persecution of her enemies. Again and again Paul warned the believers
          against these false teachers. This peril, above all others, they must guard against; for by receiving false
          teachers, they would open the door to errors by which the enemy would dim the spiritual perceptions and shake
          the conﬁdence of those newly come to the faith of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Christ was the standard by which they were to test the doctrines presented. All that was not in harmony with
          His teachings they were to reject. Christ cruciﬁed for sin, Christ risen from the dead, Christ ascended on
          <nobr>high—this</nobr> was the science of salvation that they were to learn and teach.</p>
      <p>The warnings of the Word of God regarding the perils surrounding the Christian church belong to us today. As in
          the days of the apostles men tried by tradition and philosophy to destroy faith in the Scriptures, so today,
          by the pleasing sentiments of higher criticism, evolution, spiritualism, theosophy, and pantheism, the enemy
          of righteousness is seeking to lead souls into forbidden paths. To many the Bible is as a lamp without oil,
          because they have turned their minds into channels of speculative belief that bring misunderstanding and
          confusion.</p>
      <p>The work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as
          a divine revelation. It is robbing God’s Word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human lives. By
          spiritualism, multitudes are taught to believe that desire is the highest law, that license is liberty, and
          that man is accountable only to himself.... The power</p>
      <p>of a higher, purer, nobler life is our great <nobr>need.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles,
          <nobr>473-478.</nobr></p>
