    <h1>The Joy of Well-Chosen Words</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To make an apt answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it is! Proverbs 15:23,
          R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>“A word spoken in due season, how good is it!” (K.J.V.). Souls are perishing for the lack of personal
          labor....</p>
      <p>The bright and cheerful side of religion will be represented by all who are daily consecrated to God. We should
          not dishonor our Lord by a mournful relation of trials that appear grievous. All trials that are received as
          educators will produce joy. The whole religious life will be uplifting, elevating, ennobling, fragrant with
          good words and works....</p>
      <p>[God] desires every soul to triumph in the keeping power of the Redeemer.</p>
      <p>The psalmist says: ... “Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name.... Worship</p>
      <p>the Lord in the beauty of holiness.” ... “Sing unto the Lord, ... and give thanks at the remembrance of his
          holiness.”</p>
      <p>In the gracious blessings which our heavenly Father has bestowed upon us, we may discern innumerable evidences
          of a love that is inﬁnite, and a tender pity surpassing a mother’s yearning sympathy for her wayward child.
          When we study the divine character in the light of the cross, we see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness
          blended with equity and justice. In the language of John we exclaim, “Behold, what manner of love the Father
          hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.”</p>
      <p>We see in the midst of the throne One bearing in hands, and feet, and side the marks of suffering endured to
          reconcile man to God, and God to man. Matchless mercy reveals to us a Father, inﬁnite, dwelling in light
          unapproachable, yet receiving us to Himself through the merits of His Son. The cloud of vengeance which
          threatened only misery and despair, in the reﬂected light from the cross reveals the writing of God: “Live,
          sinner, live! ye penitent and believing souls, live! I have paid a ransom.”</p>
      <p>We must gather about the cross. Christ and Him cruciﬁed must be the theme of contemplation, of conversation,
          and of our most joyful emotion. We should have special praise services for the purpose of keeping fresh in our
          thoughts everything that we receive from God, and of expressing our gratitude for His great love, and our
          willingness to trust everything to the Hand that was nailed to the cross for us.... We should learn to talk
          the</p>
      <p>language of Canaan, to sing the songs of Zion. By the mystery and glory of the cross we can estimate the value
          of man, and then we shall see and feel the importance of working for our fellow men, that they may be exalted
          to the throne of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Southern Watchman, March 7, 1905.</p>
