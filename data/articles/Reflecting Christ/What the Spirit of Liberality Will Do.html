    <h1>What the Spirit of Liberality Will Do</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>There is that scattereth, and yet in increaseth.... The liberal soul shall be made fat:</strong></p>
      <p>and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Proverbs 11:24, 25.</p>
      <p>Many have pitied the lot of the Israel of God in being compelled to give systematically, besides making liberal
          offerings yearly. An <nobr>all-wise</nobr> God knew best what system of benevolence would be in accordance
          with His providence, and has given His people directions in regard to it. It has ever proved that nine tenths
          are worth more to them than ten tenths. Those who have thought to increase their gains by withholding from
          God, or by bringing Him an inferior <nobr>offering—the</nobr> lame, the blind, or the
          <nobr>diseased—have</nobr> been sure to suffer loss.</p>
      <p>Providence, though unseen, is ever at work in the affairs of men. God’s hand can prosper or withhold, and He
          frequently withholds from one while He seems to prosper another. All this is to test and prove man to reveal
          the heart. He lets misfortune overtake one brother while He prospers others to see if those whom He favors
          have His fear before their eyes and will perform the duty enjoined upon them in His Word to love their
          neighbor as themselves and to help their poorer brother from a love to do good. Acts of generosity and
          benevolence were designed by God to keep the hearts of the children of men tender and sympathetic and to
          encourage in them an interest and affection for one another in imitation of the Master, who for our sakes
          became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. The law of tithing was founded upon an enduring
          principle and was designed to be a blessing to man.</p>
      <p>The system of benevolence was arranged to prevent the great evil, <nobr>covetousness.—Testimonies</nobr> for
          the Church 3:546, 547.</p>
      <p>The small streams of beneﬁcence must be ever kept ﬂowing into the treasury. God’s providence is far ahead,
          moving onward much faster than our <nobr>liberalities.—Welfare</nobr> Ministry, 268.</p>
      <p>When the grace of Christ is expressed in the words and works of the believers, light will shine forth to those
          who are in darkness; for while the lips are speaking to the praise of God, the hand will be stretched out in
          beneﬁcence for the help of the perishing.</p>
      <p>We read that on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples, no man said that aught
          that he possessed was his own. All they owned was held for the advance of the wonderful reformation. And
          thousands were converted in a day. When the same spirit actuates believers today, and they give back to God of
          His own with the same liberality, a wide and <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> work will be
          <nobr>accomplished.—Welfare</nobr> Ministry, 271.</p>
