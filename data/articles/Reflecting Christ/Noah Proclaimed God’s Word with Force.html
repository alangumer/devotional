    <h1>Noah Proclaimed God’s Word with Force</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. Genesis 6:22. The words that had
          been spoken to Adam were rehearsed [by Noah]— that sin and Satan should not always triumph. There was to be
          victory for those who feared God. When his voice was lifted in warning of what God was about to bring upon the
          world in judgment because of the wickedness of men, great opposition was manifested against the words of the
          messenger. The opposition, however, was not entirely worldwide; for some believed the</strong></p>
      <p>message of Noah, and zealously repeated the warning.</p>
      <p>But the men who were accounted wise were sought, and were urged to present arguments by which the message of
          Noah might be counteracted. And as the world was at peace and not at war with the prince of evil, they were
          glad of any excuse to set aside the “Thus saith the Lord” and to listen to the philosophers of the age, who
          presented the impossibility of such a change taking place in the forces of nature as Noah predicted. There is
          no enmity between fallen man and fallen angels; both are evil through apostasy, and evil, wherever it exists,
          is in league against God. Fallen men and fallen angels were united for the dethronement of God.</p>
      <p>Thus it was that the wise men of this world talked of science and the ﬁxed laws of nature, and declared that
          there could be no variation in these laws, and that this message of Noah could not possibly be true. The
          talented men of Noah’s time set themselves in league against God’s will and purpose and scorned the message
          and the messenger that He had sent.... Noah could not controvert their philosophies, or refute the claims of
          science so</p>
      <p>called; but he could proclaim the word of God; for he knew it contained the inﬁnite wisdom of the Creator, and,
          as he sounded it everywhere, it lost none of its force and reality because men of the world treated him with
          ridicule and contempt.</p>
      <p>Noah did not mix the soft, pleasing deceptions of Satan with his message. He did not utter the sentiment of
          many of his day who declared that God was too merciful to do such a terrible work. Many asserted that God
          would grant the wicked another season of probation; but Noah did not indulge them in the faintest hope that
          those who neglected the present opportunity, who rejected the present message, would be favored with another
          opportunity of salvation.... He knew the power of God, and realized that God would fulﬁll His word.</p>
      <p>His fear of God did not separate him from God, but served to draw him closer to Him, and to lead him to pour
          out his soul in earnest <nobr>supplication.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, April 18, 1895.</p>
