    <h1>Changed into His Image</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
          image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18.</strong></p>
      <p><nobr>Sin-burdened,</nobr> struggling souls, Jesus in His gloriﬁed humanity has ascended into the heavens to
          make intercession for us. “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
          inﬁrmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto
          the throne of grace.” We should be continually looking unto Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of our faith; for by
          beholding Him we shall be changed into His image, our character will be made like His. We should rejoice that
          all judgment is given to the Son, because in His humanity He has become acquainted with all the difﬁculties
          that beset humanity.</p>
      <p>To be sanctiﬁed is to become a partaker of the divine nature, catching the spirit and mind of Jesus, ever
          learning in the school of Christ. “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
          are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” It is impossible for
          any of us by our own power or our own efforts to work this change in ourselves. It is the Holy Spirit, the
          Comforter, which Jesus said He would send into the world, that changes our character into the image of Christ;
          and when this is accomplished, we reﬂect, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord. That is, the character of the
          one who thus beholds Christ is so like His, that one looking at him sees Christ’s own character shining out as
          from a mirror. Imperceptibly to ourselves, we are changed day by day from our ways and will into the ways and
          will of Christ, into the loveliness of His character. Thus we grow up into Christ, and unconsciously reﬂect
          His image.</p>
      <p>Professed Christians keep altogether too near the lowlands of earth. Their eyes are trained to see only
          commonplace things, and their minds dwell upon the things their eyes behold. Their religious experience is
          often shallow and unsatisfying, and their words are light and valueless. How can such reﬂect the image of
          Christ? How can they send forth the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness into all the dark places of the
          earth? To be a Christian is to be Christlike....</p>
      <p>[Enoch] was ever under the inﬂuence of Jesus. He reﬂected Christ’s character, exhibiting the same qualities in
          goodness, mercy, tender compassion, sympathy, forbearance, meekness, humility and love. His association with
          Christ day by day transformed him into the image of Him with whom he was so intimately
          <nobr>connected.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, December 5, 1912.</p>
