    <h1>The Science of Christianity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to
          others, I myself should be a castaway. 1 Corinthians 9:27.</strong></p>
      <p>The Christian life is a battle and a march. In this warfare there is no release; the effort must be continuous
          and persevering. It is by unceasing endeavor that we maintain the victory over the temptations of Satan.
          Christian integrity must be sought with resistless energy and maintained with a resolute ﬁxedness of
          purpose.</p>
      <p>No one will be borne upward without stern, persevering effort in his own behalf. All must engage in this
          warfare for themselves. Individually we are responsible for the issue of the struggle; though Noah, Job, and
          Daniel were in the land, they could deliver neither son nor daughter by their righteousness.</p>
      <p>There is a science of Christianity to be <nobr>mastered—a</nobr> science as much deeper, broader, higher than
          any human science as the heavens are higher than the earth. The mind is to be disciplined, educated, trained;
          for we are to do service for God in ways that are not in harmony with inborn inclination. There are hereditary
          and cultivated tendencies to evil that must be overcome. Often the training and education of a lifetime must
          be discarded, that one may become a learner in the school of Christ.</p>
      <p>Our hearts must be educated to become steadfast in God. We are to form habits of thought that will enable us to
          resist temptation. We must learn to look upward. The principles of the Word of <nobr>God—principles</nobr>
          that are as high as heaven, and that compass <nobr>eternity—we</nobr> are to understand in their bearing upon
          our daily life. Every act, every word, every thought, is to be in accord with these principles.</p>
      <p>The precious graces of the Holy Spirit are not developed in a moment. Courage, fortitude, meekness, faith,
          unwavering trust in God’s power to save, are acquired by the experience of years. By a life of holy endeavor
          and ﬁrm adherence to the right the children of God are to seal their destiny.</p>
      <p>We have no time to lose. We know not how soon our probation may close. Eternity stretches before us. The
          curtain is about to be lifted. Christ is soon to come. The angels of God are seeking to attract us from
          ourselves and from earthly things. Let them not labor in vain.</p>
      <p>When Jesus rises up in the most holy place, lays off His mediatorial robes, and clothes Himself with the
          garments of vengeance, the mandate will go forth: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: ... and he that
          is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come
          quickly; and My reward is with me” (Revelation 22:11, <nobr>12).—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church
          <nobr>8:313-315.</nobr></p>
