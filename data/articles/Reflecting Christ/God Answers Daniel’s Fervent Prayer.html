    <h1>God Answers Daniel’s Fervent Prayer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,... for unto thee am I now sent ... for from the ﬁrst day that thou
          didst set thine heart to understand ... thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. Daniel 10:11,
          12.</strong></p>
      <p>“I Daniel alone saw the vision.... And there remained no strength in me: for my</p>
      <p>comeliness was turned in me into corruption” (Daniel 10:7, 8).... All who are truly sanctiﬁed</p>
      <p>will have a similar experience. The clearer their views of the greatness, glory, and perfection of Christ, the
          more vividly will they see their own weakness and imperfection. They will have no disposition to claim a
          sinless character; that which has appeared right and comely in themselves will, in contrast with Christ’s
          purity and glory, appear only as unworthy and corruptible. It is when men are separated from God, when they
          have very indistinct views of Christ, that they say, “I am sinless; I am sanctiﬁed.”</p>
      <p>Gabriel now appeared to the prophet, and thus addressed him: “O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the
          words that I speak unto thee” (verse 11).... What great honor is</p>
      <p>shown to Daniel by the Majesty of heaven! He comforts His trembling servant and assures him that his prayer has
          been heard in heaven. In answer to that fervent petition the angel Gabriel was sent to affect the heart of the
          Persian king. The monarch had resisted the impressions of the Spirit of God during the three weeks while
          Daniel was fasting and praying, but heaven’s Prince, the Archangel, Michael, was sent to turn the heart of the
          stubborn king to take some decided action to answer the prayer of Daniel.</p>
      <p>“And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb. And, behold,
          one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips....</p>
      <p>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had
          spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my Lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me” (verse
          <nobr>15-19).</nobr></p>
      <p>So great was the divine glory revealed to Daniel that he could not endure the sight. Then the messenger of
          heaven veiled the brightness of his presence and appeared to the prophet as “one like the similitude of the
          sons of men” (verse 16). By his divine power he strengthened this man of integrity and of faith, to hear the
          message sent to him from God.</p>
      <p>Daniel was a devoted servant of the Most High. His long life was ﬁlled up with noble deeds of service for his
          Master. His purity of character and unwavering ﬁdelity are equaled only by his humility of heart and his
          contrition before God. We repeat, the life of Daniel is an inspired illustration of true
          <nobr>sanctiﬁcation.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>50-52.</nobr></p>
