    <h1>A Teacher Sent From God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son ... to redeem them that were under
          the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. Galatians 4:4, 5.</strong></p>
      <p>At the time of Christ’s ﬁrst advent darkness had covered the earth, and gross darkness the people. Truth looked
          down from heaven, and nowhere could discern the reﬂection of her image. Spiritual darkness had settled down
          over the religious world, and this darkness was almost universal and complete....</p>
      <p>All things proclaimed the urgent necessity on the earth of a Teacher sent from <nobr>God—a</nobr> Teacher in
          whom divinity and humanity would be united. It was essential that Christ should appear in human form, and
          stand at the head of the human race, to uplift fallen human beings. Thus only could God be revealed to the
          world.</p>
      <p>Christ volunteered to lay aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and come to this earth to show to human beings
          what they may be in cooperation with God. He came to shine amidst the darkness, to dispel the darkness by the
          brightness of His presence....</p>
      <p>The Father and the Son in consultation decided that Christ must come to the world as a babe, and live the life
          that human beings must live from childhood to manhood, bearing the trials that they must bear, and at the same
          time living a sinless life, that men might see in Him an example of what they can become, and that He might
          know by experience how to help them in their struggles with sin. He was tried as man is tried, tempted as man
          is tempted. The life that He lived in this world, men can live, through His power and under His
          instruction....</p>
      <p>Patriarchs and prophets have predicted the coming of a distinguished Teacher, whose words were to be clothed
          with invincible power and authority. He was to preach the gospel to the poor, and proclaim the acceptable year
          of the Lord. He was to set judgment in the earth; the isles were to wait for His law; the Gentiles were to
          come to His light, and kings to the brightness of His rising. He was “the messenger of the covenant,” and “the
          Sun of righteousness.” ...</p>
      <p>And “when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son.” ...The heavenly Teacher had come. Who was He?
          No less a being than the Son of God Himself. He appeared as God, and at the same time as the Elder Brother of
          the human <nobr>race.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, May 17, 1905.</p>
      <p>What He taught, He lived.... What He taught, He was. His words were the expression,</p>
      <p>not only of His own life experience, but of His own character. Not only did He teach the truth, but He was the
          truth. It was this that gave His teaching <nobr>power.—Education,</nobr> 78, 79.</p>
