    <h1>Testing Time Reveals Faith And Love</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. 2 Timothy
          2:19.</strong></p>
      <p><nobr>Self-denial,</nobr><nobr>self-sacriﬁce,</nobr> benevolence, kindness, love, patience, fortitude, and
          Christian trust are the daily fruits borne by those who are truly connected with God. Their acts may not be
          published to the world, but they themselves are daily wrestling with evil, and gaining precious victories over
          temptation and wrong. Solemn vows are renewed, and kept through the strength gained by earnest prayer and
          constant watching thereunto.</p>
      <p>The ardent enthusiast does not discern the struggles of these silent workers; but the eye of Him who seeth the
          secrets of the heart notices and regards with approval every effort put forth in lowliness and meekness. It
          requires the testing time to reveal the pure gold of love and faith in the character. When trials and
          perplexities come upon the church, then the steadfast zeal and warm affections of Christ’s true followers are
          developed....</p>
      <p>The humble in heart, who have daily felt the importance of riveting their souls to the eternal Rock, will stand
          unmoved amid the tempests of trial, because they trusted not to themselves....</p>
      <p>A healthy man, who is able to attend to the vocations of life and goes forth day after day to his labor with
          buoyant spirits and with a healthy current of blood ﬂowing through his veins, does not call the attention of
          everyone he meets to his soundness of body. Health and vigor are the natural conditions of his life, and
          therefore he is scarcely conscious that he is in the enjoyment of so rich a boon.</p>
      <p>Thus it is with the truly righteous man. He is unconscious of his goodness and piety. Religious principle has
          become the spring of his life and conduct, and it is just as natural for him to bear the fruits of the Spirit
          as for the ﬁg tree to bear ﬁgs or for the rosebush to yield roses. His nature is so thoroughly imbued with
          love for God and his fellow men that he works the works of Christ with a willing heart.</p>
      <p>All who come within the sphere of his inﬂuence perceive the beauty and fragrance of his Christian life, while
          he himself is unconscious of it, for it is in harmony with his habits and inclinations. He prays for divine
          light, and loves to walk in that light. It is his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly Father. His
          life is hid with Christ in <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>11-13.</nobr></p>
