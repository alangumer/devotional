    <h1>God’s Love Enables Us to Impart Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afﬂicted soul; then shall thy light rise in
          obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day. Isaiah 58:10.</strong></p>
      <p>All around us are heard the wails of a world’s sorrow. On every hand are the needy and distressed. It is ours
          to aid in relieving and softening life’s hardships and misery.</p>
      <p>Practical work will have far more effect than mere sermonizing. We are to give food to the hungry, clothing to
          the naked, and shelter to the homeless. And we are called to do more than this. The wants of the soul, only
          the love of Christ can satisfy. If Christ is abiding in us, our hearts will be full of divine sympathy. The
          sealed fountains of earnest, Christlike love will be unsealed.</p>
      <p>God calls not only for our gifts for the needy, but for our cheerful countenance, our hopeful words, our kindly
          handclasp. When Christ healed the sick, He laid His hands upon them. So should we come in close touch with
          those whom we seek to beneﬁt.</p>
      <p>There are many from whom hope has departed. Bring back the sunshine to them. Many have lost their courage.
          Speak to them words of cheer. Pray for them. There are those who need the bread of life. Read to them from the
          Word of God. Upon many is a soul sickness which no earthly balm can reach nor physician heal. Pray for these
          souls, bring them to Jesus. Tell them that there is a balm in Gilead and a Physician there.</p>
      <p>Light is a blessing, a universal blessing, pouring forth its treasures on a world unthankful, unholy,
          demoralized. So it is with the light of the Sun of Righteousness. The whole earth, wrapped as it is in the
          darkness of sin and sorrow, and pain, is to be lighted with the knowledge of God’s love. From no sect, rank,
          or class of people is the light shining from heaven’s throne to be excluded.</p>
      <p>The message of hope and mercy is to be carried to the ends of the earth. Whosoever will, may reach forth and
          take hold of God’s strength and make peace with Him, and he shall make peace. No longer are the heathen to be
          wrapped in midnight darkness. The gloom is to disappear before the bright beams of the Sun of
          Righteousness....</p>
      <p>It was the golden oil emptied by the heavenly messengers into the golden tubes, to be conducted from the golden
          bowl into the lamps of the sanctuary, that produced a continuous bright and shining light. It is the love of
          God continually transferred to man that enables him to impart light. Into the hearts of all who are united to
          God by faith the golden oil of love ﬂows freely, to shine out again in good works, in real, heartfelt service
          for <nobr>God.—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons, <nobr>417-419.</nobr></p>
