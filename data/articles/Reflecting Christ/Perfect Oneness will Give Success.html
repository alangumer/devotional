      <p><strong>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us:
          that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. John 17:21.</strong></p>
      <p>I urge our people to cease their criticism and <nobr>evil-speaking,</nobr> and go to God in earnest prayer,
          asking Him to help them to help the erring. Let them link up with one another and with Christ. Let them study
          the seventeenth of John, and learn how to pray and how to live the prayer of Christ. He is the Comforter. He
          will abide in their hearts, making their joy full. His words will be to them as the bread of life, and in the
          strength thus gained they will be enabled to develop characters that will be an honor to God. Perfect
          Christian fellowship will exist among them. There will be seen in their lives the fruit that always appears as
          the result of obedience to the truth.</p>
      <p>Let us make Christ’s prayer the rule of our life, that we may form characters that will reveal to the world the
          power of the grace of God. Let there be less talk about petty differences, and a more diligent study of what
          the prayer of Christ means to those who believe on His name. We are to pray for union, and then live in such a
          way that God can answer our prayers.</p>
      <p>Perfect <nobr>oneness—a</nobr> union as close as the union existing between the Father and the
          <nobr>Son—this</nobr> is what will give success to the efforts of God’s <nobr>workers.—Manuscript</nobr> 1,
          1903.</p>
      <p>Complete union with Christ and with one another is absolutely necessary to the perfection of believers.
          Christ’s presence by faith in the hearts of believers is their power, their life. It brings union with God.
          “Thou in me.” Union with God through Christ makes the church <nobr>perfect.—Undated</nobr> Manuscript
          133.</p>
      <p>He who seeks to serve others by <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce</nobr> will be given the
          attributes of character that commend themselves to God, and develop wisdom, true patience, forbearance,
          kindness, compassion. This gives him the chiefest place in the kingdom of <nobr>God.—Manuscript</nobr> 165,
          1898.</p>
      <p>Nothing can perfect a perfect unity in the church but the spirit of Christlike forbearance. Satan can sow
          discord; Christ alone can harmonize the disagreeing elements.... When you</p>
      <p>as individual workers of the church love God supremely and your neighbor as yourself, then there will be no
          labored efforts to be in unity, there will be oneness in Christ, the ears to report will be closed, and no one
          will take up a reproach against his neighbor. The members of the church will cherish love and unity and be as
          one great family. Then we shall bear the credentials to the world that will testify that God has sent His Son
          into the world. Christ has said, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
          another.”</p>
      <p><nobr>—Letter</nobr> 29, 1889.</p>
