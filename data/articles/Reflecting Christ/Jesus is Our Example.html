    <h1>Jesus is Our Example</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In a word, as God’s dear children, try to be like him. Ephesians 5:1, N.E.B.</strong></p>
      <p>God’s watchmen must not study how they shall please the people, nor listen to their words and utter them; for
          they must listen to hear what saith the Lord, what is His word for the people. If they rely upon discourses
          prepared years before, they may fail to meet the necessities of the occasion. Their hearts should be laid open
          so that the Lord may impress their minds, and then they will be able to give the people the precious truth
          warm from heaven....</p>
      <p>There is altogether too little of the Spirit and power of God in the labor of the watchmen. The Spirit which
          characterized that wonderful meeting on the Day of Pentecost is waiting to manifest its power upon the men who
          are now standing between the living and the dead as ambassadors for God. The power which stirred the people so
          mightily in the 1844 movement will again be revealed. The third angel’s message will go forth, not in
          whispered tones, but with a loud voice.</p>
      <p>Many who profess to have great light are walking in sparks of their own kindling. They need to have their lips
          touched with a live coal from off the altar, that they may pour forth the truth like men who are
          inspired....</p>
      <p>Had Christ come in the majesty of a king, with the pomp which attends the great men of earth, many would have
          accepted Him. But Jesus of Nazareth did not dazzle the senses with a display of outward glory and make this
          the foundation of their reverence. He came as a humble man to be the Teacher and Exemplar as well as the
          Redeemer of the race. Had he encouraged pomp, had He come followed by a retinue of the great men of earth, how
          could He have taught humility? how could He have presented such burning truths as in His Sermon upon the
          Mount? His example was such as He wished all His followers to imitate. Where would have been the hope of the
          lowly in life had He come in exaltation and dwelt as a king upon the earth?</p>
      <p>Jesus knew the needs of the world better than they themselves knew. He did not come as an angel, clothed with
          the panoply of heaven, but as a man. Yet combined with His humility was an inherent power and grandeur that
          awed men while they loved Him. Although possessing such loveliness, such an unassuming appearance, He moved
          among them with the dignity and power of a <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> king. The people were amazed, confounded.
          They tried to reason the matter out; but, unwilling to renounce their own ideas, they yielded to doubts,
          clinging to the old expectation of a Saviour to come in earthly <nobr>grandeur.—Testimonies</nobr> for the
          Church 5:252, 253.</p>
