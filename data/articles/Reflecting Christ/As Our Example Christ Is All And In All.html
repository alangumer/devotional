    <h1>As Our Example Christ Is All And In All</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>In him was life; and the life was the light of men. John 1:4.</strong></p>
      <p>The ethics inculcated by the gospel acknowledge no standard but the perfection of God’s mind, God’s will. God
          requires from His creatures conformity to His will. Imperfection of character is sin, and sin is the
          transgression of the law. All righteous attributes of character dwell in God as a perfect, harmonious whole.
          Everyone who receives Christ as his personal Saviour is privileged to possess these attributes. This is the
          science of holiness.</p>
      <p>How glorious are the possibilities set before the fallen race! Through His Son, God has revealed the excellency
          to which man is capable of attaining. Through the merits of Christ, man is lifted from his depraved state,
          puriﬁed, and made more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir. It is possible for him to become a companion
          of the angels in glory, and to reﬂect the image of Jesus Christ, shining even in the bright splendor of the
          eternal throne. It is his privilege to have faith that through the power of Christ he shall be made immortal.
          Yet how seldom he realizes to what heights he could attain if he would allow God to direct his every
          step!</p>
      <p>God permits every human being to exercise his individuality. He desires no one to submerge his mind in the mind
          of a fellow mortal. Those who desire to be transformed in mind and character are not to look to men, but to
          the divine Example. God gives the invitation, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” By
          conversion and transformation, men are to receive the mind of Christ. Every one is to stand before God with an
          individual faith, an individual experience, knowing for himself that Christ is formed within, the hope of
          glory. For us to imitate the example of any <nobr>man—even</nobr> one whom we might regard as nearly perfect
          in <nobr>character—would</nobr> be to put our trust in a defective human being, one who is unable to impart a
          jot or tittle of perfection.</p>
      <p>As our Example, we have One who is all and in all, the chiefest among ten thousand, One whose excellency is
          beyond comparison. He graciously adapted His life for universal imitation. United in Christ were wealth and
          poverty; majesty and abasement; unlimited power and meekness and lowliness which in every soul who receives
          Him will be reﬂected. In Him, through the qualities and powers of the human mind, the wisdom of the greatest
          Teacher the world has ever known was revealed.</p>
      <p>Before the world, God is developing us as living witnesses to what men and women may become through the grace
          of <nobr>Christ.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, September 3, 1902.</p>
