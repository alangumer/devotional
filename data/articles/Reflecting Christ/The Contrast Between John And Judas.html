    <h1>The Contrast Between John And Judas</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 1 John
          5:12.</strong></p>
      <p>During the years of his close association with Christ, he [John] was often warned and cautioned by the Saviour;
          and these reproofs he accepted. As the character of the Divine One was manifested to him, John saw his own
          deﬁciencies, and was humbled by the revelation. Day by day, in contrast with his own violent spirit, he beheld
          the tenderness and forbearance of Jesus, and heard His lessons of humility and patience. Day by day his heart
          was drawn out to Christ, until he lost sight of self in love for his Master. The power and tenderness, the
          majesty and meekness, the strength and patience, that he saw in the daily life of the Son of God, ﬁlled his
          soul with admiration. He yielded his resentful, ambitious temper to the molding power of Christ, and divine
          love wrought in him a transformation of character.</p>
      <p>In striking contrast to the sanctiﬁcation worked out in the life of John is the experience of his fellow
          disciple, Judas. Like his associate, Judas professed to be a disciple of Christ, but he possessed only a form
          of godliness. He was not insensible to the beauty of the character of Christ; and often, as he listened to the
          Saviour’s words, conviction came to him, but he would not humble his heart or confess his sins....</p>
      <p>John warred earnestly against his faults; but Judas violated his conscience and yielded to temptation,
          fastening upon himself more securely his habits of evil. The practice of the truths that Christ taught was at
          variance with his desires and purposes, and he could not bring himself to yield his ideas in order to receive
          wisdom from heaven. Instead of walking in the light, he chose to walk in darkness. Evil desires, covetousness,
          revengeful passions, dark and sullen thoughts, were cherished until Satan gained full control of him.</p>
      <p>John and Judas are representatives of those who profess to be Christ’s followers. Both these disciples had the
          same opportunities to study and follow the divine Pattern....</p>
      <p>Each possessed serious defects of character; and each had access to the divine grace that transforms character.
          But while one in humility was learning of Jesus, the other revealed that he was not a doer of the word, but a
          hearer only. One, daily dying to self and overcoming sin, was sanctiﬁed through the truth; the other,
          resisting the transforming power of grace and indulging selﬁsh desires, was brought into bondage to
          Satan....</p>
      <p>There may be marked defects in the character of an individual, yet when he becomes a true disciple of Christ,
          the power of divine grace transforms and sanctiﬁes <nobr>him.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles,
          <nobr>557-559.</nobr></p>
