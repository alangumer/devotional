    <h1>Christ Recognized the Dignity of Humanity</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is
          our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us. Ephesians
          2:13, 14.</strong></p>
      <p>Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed. The scribes and Pharisees desired to make a
          local and a national beneﬁt of the gifts of heaven, and to exclude the rest of God’s family in the world. But
          Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as
          unconﬁned as the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth.</p>
      <p>The life of Christ established a religion in which there is no caste, a religion by which Jew and Gentile, free
          and bond, are linked in a common brotherhood, equal before God. No question of policy inﬂuenced His movements.
          He made no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies. That which appealed to His heart
          was a soul thirsting for the waters of life.</p>
      <p>He passed by no human being as worthless, but sought to apply the healing remedy to every soul. In whatever
          company He found Himself, He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the circumstances. Every neglect
          or insult shown by men to their fellow men only made Him more conscious of their need of His
          <nobr>divine-human</nobr> sympathy. He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and most unpromising, setting
          before them the assurance that they might become blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as would
          make them manifest as the children of God.</p>
      <p>Often He met those who had drifted under Satan’s control, and who had no power to break from his snare. To such
          a one, discouraged, sick, tempted, fallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest pity, words that were needed
          and could be understood. Others He met who were ﬁghting a <nobr>hand-to-hand</nobr> battle with the adversary
          of souls. These He encouraged to persevere, assuring them that they would win; for angels of God were on their
          side, and would give them the victory.</p>
      <p>At the table of the publicans He sat as an honored guest, by His sympathy and social kindliness showing that He
          recognized the dignity of humanity; and men longed to become worthy of His conﬁdence. Upon their thirsty
          hearts His words fell with blessed, <nobr>life-giving</nobr> power. New impulses were awakened, and to these
          outcasts of society there opened the possibility of a new life.</p>
      <p>Though He was a Jew, Jesus mingled freely with the Samaritans.... And while He drew</p>
      <p>their hearts to Him by the tie of human sympathy, His divine grace brought to them the salvation which the Jews
          <nobr>rejected.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, 25, 26.</p>
