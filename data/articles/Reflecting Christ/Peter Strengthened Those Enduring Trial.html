    <h1>Peter Strengthened Those Enduring Trial</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perisheth, though it be tried
          with ﬁre, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter
          1:7.</strong></p>
      <p>Human beings, themselves given to evil, are prone to deal untenderly with the tempted and the erring. They
          cannot read the heart; they know not its struggle and its pain. Of the rebuke that is love, of the blow that
          wounds to heal, of the warning that speaks hope, they have need to learn.</p>
      <p>Throughout his ministry, Peter faithfully watched over the ﬂock entrusted to his care, and thus proved himself
          worthy of the charge and responsibility given him by the Saviour. Ever he exalted Jesus of Nazareth as the
          Hope of Israel, the Saviour of mankind. He brought his own life under the discipline of the Master Worker. By
          every means within his power he sought to educate the believers for active service. His godly example and
          untiring activity inspired many young men of promise to give themselves wholly to the work of the
          ministry.</p>
      <p>As time went on, the apostle’s inﬂuence as an educator and leader increased; and while he never lost his burden
          to labor especially for the Jews, yet he bore his testimony in many lands and strengthened the faith of
          multitudes in the gospel.</p>
      <p>In the later years of his ministry, Peter was inspired to write to the believers “scattered throughout Pontus,
          Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.” His letters were the means of reviving the courage and strengthening
          the faith of those who were enduring trial and afﬂiction, and of renewing to good works those who through
          manifold temptations were in danger of losing their hold upon God. These letters bear the impress of having
          been written by one in whom the sufferings of Christ and also His consolation had been made to abound; one
          whose entire being had been transformed by grace, and whose hope of eternal life was sure and steadfast.</p>
      <p>At the very beginning of his ﬁrst letter the aged servant of God ascribed to his Lord a tribute of praise and
          thanksgiving. “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,” he exclaimed, “which according to his
          abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to
          an inheritance incorruptible, and undeﬁled, and that fadeth not away.” ...</p>
      <p>In this hope of a sure inheritance in the earth made new, the early Christians rejoiced, even in times of
          severe trial and <nobr>afﬂiction.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, <nobr>516-518.</nobr></p>
