    <h1>God Calls Young People</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. Psalm
          71:17.</strong></p>
      <p>There is a great work to be done in the Master’s vineyard. To accomplish this work, God calls for men to whom
          He has given ability for service. He does nothing without man’s cooperation.</p>
      <p>Whenever the Lord has a work to be done, He calls not only the commanding ofﬁcers, but all the workers. He
          calls young men and women who are strong and active in mind. He desires them to bring into the work their
          fresh, healthy powers of brain, bone, and muscle. They are to take part in the conﬂict against principalities
          and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>
      <p>Men have nothing but that which God has given them in trust. They are not to indulge pride or to boast of their
          talents. They owe to God all that makes it possible for them to labor for Him. Yet every man has a part to act
          in preparing himself for service. By earnest study, taxing effort, he is to cultivate all his powers. Then
          divine power will surely combine with his efforts.</p>
      <p>Some young men are urging their way into the work who have no real ﬁtness for it. They do not understand that
          they need to be taught before they can teach. They point to men who with little preparation have labored with
          a measure of success. But if these men have been successful, it is because they put their heart and soul into
          the work.... The cause of God</p>
      <p>needs efﬁcient men....</p>
      <p>Redemption, what is it? It is the training process for heaven. This training means more than a knowledge of
          books. It means a knowledge of Christ, emancipation from ideas, habits, and practices that have been gained in
          the school of the prince of darkness. The soul must be delivered from all that is opposed to loyalty to God.
          Resistance of evil must be encouraged....</p>
      <p>God gives all an opportunity in this life to develop character. All may ﬁll their appointed place in His great
          plan. The Lord accepted Samuel from his very childhood, because his heart was pure, and he had reverence for
          God. He was given to God, a consecrated offering, and the Lord made him, even in his childhood, a channel of
          light.</p>
      <p>A life consecrated as was Samuel’s is of great value in God’s sight. If the youth of today will consecrate
          themselves as did Samuel, the Lord will accept them and use them in His work. Of their life they may be able
          to say with the psalmist, “O Lord, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy
          wondrous <nobr>works.”—Manuscript</nobr> 51, 1900.</p>
