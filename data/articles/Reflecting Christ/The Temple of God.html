    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which
          died for them, and rose again. 2 Corinthians 5:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Man is God’s workmanship, His masterpiece, created for a high and holy purpose; and on every part of the human
          tabernacle God desires to write His law. Every nerve and muscle, every mental and physical endowment, is to be
          kept pure.</p>
      <p>God designs that the body shall be a temple for His Spirit. How solemn then is the responsibility resting on
          every soul. If we deﬁle our bodies, we are doing harm not only to ourselves, but to many others....</p>
      <p>Christ died that the moral image of God might be restored in humanity, that men and women might be partakers of
          the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. We are to use no power of
          our being for selﬁsh gratiﬁcation; for all our powers belong to Him, and are to be used to His glory....</p>
      <p>The human house, God’s building, requires close, watchful guardianship. With David we can exclaim, “I am
          fearfully and wonderfully made.” God’s workmanship is to be preserved, that the heavenly universe and the
          apostate race may see that men and women are temples of the living God.</p>
      <p>The perfection of character which God requires is the ﬁtting up of the whole being as a temple for the
          indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The Lord requires the service of the entire being. He desires men and women to
          become all that He has made it possible for them to be. It is not enough for certain parts of the human
          machinery to be used. All parts must be brought into action, or the service is deﬁcient....</p>
      <p>The physical life is to be carefully educated, cultivated, and developed, that through men and women the divine
          nature may be revealed in its fullness. God expects men to use the intellect He has given them. He expects
          them to use every reasoning power for Him. They are to give the conscience the place of supremacy that has
          been assigned to it. The mental and physical powers, with the affections, are to be so cultivated that they
          can reach the highest efﬁciency. Thus Christ is represented to the world....</p>
      <p>Is God pleased to see any of the organs or faculties He has given man neglected, misused, or deprived of the
          health and efﬁciency it is possible for them to have? Then cultivate the gift of faith. Be brave, and overcome
          every practice which mars the soul temple. We are wholly dependent on God, and our faith is strengthened be
          believing, though we cannot see God’s purpose in His dealing with us, or the consequence of this dealing.
          Faith points forward and upward to things to come, laying hold of the only power that can make us complete in
          <nobr>Him.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, November 6, 1900.</p>
