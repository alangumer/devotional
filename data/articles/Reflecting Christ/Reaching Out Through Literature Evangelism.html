    <h1>Reaching Out Through Literature Evangelism</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am among you as he that serveth. Luke 22:27.</strong></p>
      <p>Canvassing for our publications is an important and most proﬁtable line of evangelistic work. Our publications
          can go to places where meetings cannot be held. In such places the faithful evangelistic canvasser takes the
          place of the living preacher....</p>
      <p>May the Lord move upon many of our young men and women to enter the canvassing ﬁeld as canvassing evangelists.
          By the canvassing work the truth is presented to thousands that otherwise would not hear it. Our time for work
          is short. Many, very many, need the promptitude of the “quickly” in them, to lead them to arouse and go to
          work. The Lord calls for workers just now....</p>
      <p>Why is there not now more diligent seeking of the Lord, that hundreds may be ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit, and
          may go forth quickly to proclaim the truth, “the Lord working with them and conﬁrming the Word with signs
          following”? Our commission is to let the light shine forth everywhere from the press. By the printed page the
          light reaches the isolated ones, who have no opportunity to hear the living preachers. This is most blessed
          missionary work. Canvassers can be the Lord’s helping hand, opening doors for the entrance of the truth.</p>
      <p>Let Christian youth be selected to handle the books containing present truth.... This is a</p>
      <p>sacred work, and those who enter it should be able to bear witness for Christ.</p>
      <p>Those youth who go into this work should be connected with those older in experience, who, if they are devoted
          to God, can be a great blessing to them, teaching them in the things of God, and showing them how best to work
          for Him. If the youth will work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, they will know by experience
          that God is working with them, to will and to do of His good pleasure.</p>
      <p>Not only men, but women, can enter the canvassing ﬁeld. And canvassers are to go out two by two. This is the
          Lord’s plan.</p>
      <p>I am instructed to encourage decided efforts to secure helping hands to do missionary work, to give Bible
          instruction and to sell books containing present truth. Thus skillful work may be done in hunting for souls.
          Young men, your help is called for. Make a covenant with God by sacriﬁce. Take hold of His work. He is your
          sufﬁciency. “Be strong, yea, be <nobr>strong.”—Paciﬁc</nobr> Union Recorder, October 23, 1902.</p>
