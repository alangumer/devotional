      <p><strong>They shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. Revelation 3:4.</strong></p>
      <p>Lead the youth to see that in dress, as in diet, plain living is indispensable to high thinking. Lead them to
          see how much there is to learn and to do; how precious are the days of youth as a preparation for the
          lifework. Help them to see what treasures there are in the Word of God, in the book of nature, and in the
          records of noble lives.</p>
      <p>Let their minds be directed to the suffering which they might relieve. Help them to see that by every dollar
          squandered in display, the spender is deprived of means for feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and
          comforting the sorrowful.</p>
      <p>They cannot afford to miss life’s glorious opportunities, to dwarf their minds, to ruin their health, and to
          wreck their happiness, for the sake of obedience to mandates that have no foundation in reason, in comfort, or
          in comeliness.</p>
      <p>At the same time the young should be taught to recognize the lesson of nature, “He hath made every thing
          beautiful in its time” (Ecclesiastes 3:11, R.V.). In dress, as in all things else, it is our privilege to
          honor our Creator. He desires our clothing to be not only neat and healthful, but appropriate and
          becoming.</p>
      <p>A person’s character is judged by his style of dress. A reﬁned taste, a cultivated mind, will be revealed in
          the choice of simple and appropriate attire. Chaste simplicity in dress, when united with modesty of demeanor,
          will go far toward surrounding a young woman with that atmosphere of sacred reserve which will be to her a
          shield from a thousand perils.</p>
      <p>Let girls be taught that the art of dressing well includes the ability to make their own clothing.... It will
          be a means of usefulness and independence that she cannot afford to</p>
      <p>miss....</p>
      <p>Let the youth and little children be taught to choose for themselves that royal robe woven in heaven’s
          <nobr>loom—the</nobr> “ﬁne linen, clean and white” (Revelation 19:8), which all the holy ones of earth will
          wear. This robe, Christ’s own spotless character, is freely offered to every human being. But all who receive
          it will receive and wear it here.</p>
      <p>Let the children be taught that as they open their minds to pure, loving thoughts and do loving and helpful
          deeds, they are clothing themselves with His beautiful garment of character. This apparel will make them
          beautiful and beloved here, and will hereafter be their title of admission to the palace of the King. His
          promise is: “They shall walk with me in white: for they are <nobr>worthy.”—Education,</nobr> 248, 249.</p>
