    <h1>Keep Your Will on the Lord’s Side</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 1
          John 2:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Pure religion has to do with the will. The will is the governing power in the nature of man, bringing all the
          other faculties under its sway. The will is not the taste or the inclination, but it is the deciding power,
          which works in the children of men unto obedience to God, or unto disobedience....</p>
      <p>You cannot control your impulses, your emotions, as you may desire, but you can control the will, and you can
          make an entire change in your life. By yielding up your will to Christ, [you] will be hid with Christ in God,
          and allied to the power which is above all principalities and powers. You will have strength from God that
          will hold you fast to His strength; and a new light, even the light of living faith, will be possible to you.
          But your will must cooperate with God’s will, not with the will of associates through whom Satan is constantly
          working to ensnare and destroy you....</p>
      <p>By steadfastly keeping the will on the Lord’s side, [you will bring] every emotion ...</p>
      <p>into captivity to the will of Jesus. You will then ﬁnd your feet on solid rock. It will take, at times, every
          particle of willpower that you possess, but it is God that is working for you, and you will come forth from
          the molding process a vessel unto honor.</p>
      <p>Talk faith. Keep on God’s side of the line. Set not your foot on the enemy’s side, and the Lord will be your
          helper. He will do for you that which it is not possible for you to do for yourself. The result will be that
          you will become like a “cedar of Lebanon.” Your life will be noble, and your works will be wrought in God.
          There will be in you a power, an earnestness, and a simplicity that will make you a polished instrument in the
          hands of God.</p>
      <p>You need to drink daily at the fountain of truth, that you may understand the secret of pleasure and joy in the
          Lord. But you must remember that your will is the spring of all your actions. This will, that forms so
          important a factor in the character of man, was at the Fall given into the control of Satan....</p>
      <p>But the inﬁnite sacriﬁce of God in giving Jesus, His beloved Son, to become a sacriﬁce for sin, enables Him to
          say, without violating one principle of His government, “Yield yourself up to Me; give Me that will; take it
          from the control of Satan, and I will take possession of it; then I can work in you to will and to do of My
          good pleasure.” When He gives you the mind of Christ, your will becomes as His will, and your character is
          transformed to be like Christ’s <nobr>character.—Messages</nobr> to Young People, <nobr>151-154.</nobr></p>
