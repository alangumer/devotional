    <h1>An Imperishable Jewel</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let not yours be the outward adorning with ... decoration of gold, and wearing of ﬁne clothing, but let
          it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s
          sight is very precious. 1 Peter 3:3, 4, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>While at Brother Harris’s I had an interview with a sister who wore gold, and yet professed to be looking for
          Christ’s coming. We spoke of the express declaration of Scripture against the wearing of gold. But she
          referred to where Solomon was commanded to beautify the Temple, and to the statement that the streets of the
          City of God were pure gold. She said that if we could improve our appearance by wearing gold, so as to have
          inﬂuence in the world, it was right.</p>
      <p>I replied that we were poor fallen mortals, and instead of decorating these bodies because Solomon’s Temple was
          gloriously adorned, we should remember our fallen condition, and that it cost the suffering and death of the
          Son of God to redeem us. This thought should cause us <nobr>self-abasement.</nobr></p>
      <p>Jesus is our pattern. If He would lay aside His humiliation and sufferings, and cry, “If any man will come
          after Me, let him please himself, and enjoy the world, and he shall be My disciple,” the multitude would
          believe and follow Him. But Jesus will come to us in no other character than that of the meek, cruciﬁed One.
          If we would be with Him in heaven, we must be like Him on earth. The world will claim its own; and whoever
          will overcome must leave what belongs to <nobr>it.—Life</nobr> Sketches, pp. 113, 114.</p>
      <p>In the day when the accounts of all are balanced, will you feel ... that the beauty of the outward man was
          sought, while the inward beauty of the soul was almost entirely neglected?</p>
      <p>Have not our sisters sufﬁcient zeal and moral courage to place themselves without excuse upon the Bible
          platform? The apostle has given most explicit direction on this point: “I will therefore ... that women adorn
          themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or
          costly array; but ... with good <nobr>works.”—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 4:630.</p>
      <p>Love of dress and pleasure is wrecking the happiness of thousands.... To dress plainly,</p>
      <p>abstaining from display of jewelry and ornaments of every kind, is in keeping with our
          <nobr>faith.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 3:366.</p>
      <p>The inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit is priceless. In the life of the true Christian the outward
          adorning is always in harmony with the inward peace and holiness....</p>
      <p>It is right to love beauty and desire it; but God desires us to love and seek ﬁrst the highest beauty, that
          which is <nobr>imperishable.—The</nobr> Acts of the Apostles, 523.</p>
