    <h1>The Fields are Ready to Harvest</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your
          eyes, and look on the ﬁelds; for they are white already to harvest. John 4:35.</strong></p>
      <p>God’s servants are not to exhaust their time and strength in working especially for those whose whole lifetime
          has been devoted to the service of Satan, till the entire being is corrupted. As the outcasts
          <nobr>come—and</nobr> they will come, as they came to <nobr>Christ—we</nobr> are to forbid them not. We are to
          reach out to them a helping hand. But God calls for workers to reach those of the higher classes, who, if
          converted, could in turn work for those of their own standing. He desires to see converted talent and
          converted inﬂuence in the ministry enlisted in His service. The Lord is working upon men and women of talent
          and inﬂuence, leading them to connect with those who are giving the last message of mercy to the world.</p>
      <p>A mistake has been made in setting young men and young women at work in the slums of our great cities. Few will
          be saved as a result of this work.... The Lord has shown me that</p>
      <p>our work is to bring into the truth those who will be producers as well as consumers. There are men of talent
          and inﬂuence who are longing for something they have not yet received. Let the truth in its simplicity be
          presented to them. If converted, they would exert a powerful inﬂuence for the truth.</p>
      <p>God has men whom He will call into His service, men who will not carry forward the work in the lifeless way in
          which it has been carried forward in the past. Many who have not yet heard the message to be given to the
          world have learned the meaning of <nobr>self-denial</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> Men will come into
          the truth who will work with earnestness and zeal, tact and understanding. Let none discourage these zealous
          workers. In some things they will make some mistakes, and will need to be corrected and instructed. But have
          not men who have been longer in the truth made mistakes, and needed correction and instruction? When they made
          mistakes, the Lord did not cast them off, but healed them and strengthened them, presenting them with His
          banner to hold aloft.</p>
      <p>God selects His messengers, and gives them His message; and He says, “Forbid them not.” New methods must be
          introduced. God’s people must awaken to the necessity of the time in which they are living.</p>
      <p>[Christ] knew that when the Holy Spirit should be poured out on the disciples, the harvest of His
          <nobr>seed-sowing</nobr> would be reaped. Thousands would be converted in a day....</p>
      <p>Time is passing, and the Lord calls upon the workers in all lines of His work to lift up their eyes and behold
          the ﬁelds all ripe for the <nobr>harvest.—Paciﬁc</nobr> Union Recorder, October 23, 1902.</p>
