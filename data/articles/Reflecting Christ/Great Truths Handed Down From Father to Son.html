    <h1>Great Truths Handed Down From Father to Son</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>[The king] made him [Joseph] lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions, to instruct his
          princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom. Psalm 105:21, 22, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>In his childhood, Joseph had been taught the love and fear of God. Often in his father’s tent, under the Syrian
          stars, he had been told the story of the night vision at Bethel, of the ladder from heaven to earth, and the
          descending and ascending angels and of Him who from the throne above revealed Himself to Jacob. He had been
          told the story of the conﬂict beside the Jabbok, when, renouncing cherished sins, Jacob stood conqueror, and
          received the title of a prince with God.</p>
      <p>A shepherd boy, tending his father’s ﬂocks, Joseph’s pure and simple life had favored the development of both
          physical and mental power. By communion with God through nature and the study of the great truths handed down
          as a sacred trust from father to son, he had gained strength of mind and ﬁrmness of principle.</p>
      <p>In the crisis of his life, when making that terrible journey from his childhood home in Canaan to the bondage
          which awaited him in Egypt, looking for the last time on the hills that hid the tents of his kindred, Joseph
          remembered his father’s God. He remembered the lessons of his childhood, and his soul thrilled with the
          resolve to prove himself <nobr>true—ever</nobr> to act as became a subject of the King of heaven.</p>
      <p>In the bitter life of a stranger and a slave, amidst the sights and sounds of vice and allurements of heathen
          worship, a worship surrounded with all the attractions of wealth and culture and the pomp of royalty, Joseph
          was steadfast. He had learned the lesson of obedience to duty. Faithfulness in every station, from the most
          lowly to the most exalted, trained every power for highest service.</p>
      <p>At the time when he was called to the court of Pharaoh, Egypt was the greatest of nations. In civilization,
          art, learning, she was unequaled. Through a period of utmost difﬁculty and danger, Joseph administered the
          affairs of the kingdom; and this he did in a manner that won the conﬁdence of the king and the people. Pharaoh
          “made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: to bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach
          his senators wisdom” (K.J.V.)....</p>
      <p>Loyalty to God, faith in the Unseen, was Joseph’s anchor. In this lay the hiding of his power. “The arms of his
          hands were made strong By the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.”...</p>
      <p>Joseph and Daniel proved themselves true to the principles of their early training, true to Him whose
          representatives they were.— Education, <nobr>52-57.</nobr></p>
