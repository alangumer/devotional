    <h1>Divine Power Obtained Through Prayer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary
          place, and there prayed. Mark 1:35.</strong></p>
      <p>No other life was ever so crowded with labor and responsibility as was that of Jesus; yet how often He was
          found in prayer! How constant was His communion with God! Again and again in the history of His earthly life
          are found records such as these:... “Great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
          inﬁrmities. And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.” “And it came to pass in those days, that
          he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God” (Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12).</p>
      <p>In a life wholly devoted to the good of others, the Saviour found it necessary to withdraw from the
          thoroughfares of travel and from the throng that followed Him day after day. He must turn aside from a life of
          ceaseless activity and contact with human needs, to seek retirement and unbroken communion with His Father. As
          one with us, a sharer in our needs and weaknesses, He was wholly dependent upon God, and in the secret place
          of prayer He sought divine strength, that He might go forth braced for duty and trial. In a world of sin Jesus
          endured struggles and torture of soul. In communion with God He could unburden the sorrows that were crushing
          Him. Here He found comfort and joy.</p>
      <p>In Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of inﬁnite pity. As a man He supplicated the throne of God
          till His humanity was charged with a heavenly current that should connect humanity with divinity. Through
          continual communion He received life from God, that He might impart life to the world. His experience is to be
          ours.</p>
      <p>“Come ye yourselves apart,” He bids us. If we would give heed to His Word, we should be stronger and more
          useful....</p>
      <p>In all who are under the training of God is to be revealed a life that is not in harmony with the world, its
          customs, or its practices; and everyone needs to have a personal experience in obtaining a knowledge of the
          will of God. We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in
          quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, “Be
          still, and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10).</p>
      <p>Here alone can true rest be found. And this is the effectual preparation for all who labor for God. Amid the
          hurrying throng, and the strain of life’s intense activities, the soul that is thus refreshed will be
          surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. The life will breathe out fragrance, and will reveal a
          divine power that will reach men’s <nobr>hearts.—The</nobr> Desire of Ages, <nobr>362-363.</nobr></p>
