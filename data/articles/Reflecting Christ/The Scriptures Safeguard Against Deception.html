    <h1>The Scriptures Safeguard Against Deception</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
          light in them. Isaiah 8:20.</strong></p>
      <p>The people of God are directed to the Scriptures as their safeguard against the inﬂuence of false teachers and
          the delusive power of spirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent men from obtaining a
          knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions.... So closely will the counterfeit
          resemble the true that it will be</p>
      <p>impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and
          every miracle must be tested.</p>
      <p>Those who endeavor to obey all the commandments of God will be opposed and derided. They can stand only in God.
          In order to endure the trial before them, they must understand the will of God as revealed in His Word; they
          can honor Him only as they have a right conception of His character, government, and purposes, and act in
          accordance with them. None but those who have fortiﬁed the mind with the truths of the Bible will stand
          through the last great conﬂict....</p>
      <p>The apostle Paul declared, looking down to the last days: “The time will come when they will not endure sound
          doctrine” (2 Timothy 4:3). That time has fully come. The multitudes do not want Bible truth, because it
          interferes with the desires of the sinful, <nobr>world-loving</nobr> heart; and Satan supplies the deceptions
          which they love.</p>
      <p>But God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible only, as the standard of all
          doctrines and the basis of all reforms. The opinions of learned men, the deductions of science, the creeds or
          decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and discordant as are the churches which they represent, the
          voice of the <nobr>majority—not</nobr> one nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for or against any
          point of religious faith. Before accepting any doctrine or precept, we should demand a plain “Thus saith the
          Lord” in its support.</p>
      <p>Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the place of God. He leads the people to look to
          bishops, to pastors, to professors of theology, as their guides, instead of searching the Scriptures to learn
          their duty for themselves. Then, by controlling the minds of these leaders, he can inﬂuence the multitudes
          according to his will.</p>
      <p>When Christ came to speak the words of life, the common people heard Him gladly; and many, even of the priests
          and rulers, believed on <nobr>Him.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, <nobr>593-595.</nobr></p>
