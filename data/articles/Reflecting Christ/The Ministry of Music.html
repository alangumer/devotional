    <h1>The Ministry of Music</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>My tongue will sing of your righteousness. Psalm 51:14, N.I.V.</strong></p>
      <p>Instruction in singing is greatly needed in every school. Much more interest should be manifested.... Students
          who have learned to sing, with melodious voices, sweet gospel songs</p>
      <p>in such a way that the words are easily understood can do much good as singing evangelists. They will ﬁnd many
          opportunities to use the talent that God has given them, carrying melody and sunshine into many lonely places
          darkened by sin and sorrow and afﬂiction, by singing to those who seldom have the privileges of any kind of
          gospel ministry.</p>
      <p>Go out into the highways and the hedges. Endeavor to reach the higher as well as the lower classes. Enter the
          homes of the rich and the poor. As you go from house to house to sing, ask, “Would you be pleased to have us
          sing? We should be glad to hold a song service with you, and to offer a few words of prayer to ask God to keep
          us.” Not many will refuse you <nobr>entrance—Manuscript</nobr> 67, 1903.</p>
      <p>A spirit of devotion was cherished in the schools of the prophets.... Students ... were</p>
      <p>taught how to pray, how to approach their Creator, how to exercise faith in Him, and how to understand and obey
          the teachings of His Spirit. Sanctiﬁed intellects brought forth from the treasure house of God things new and
          old, and the Spirit of God was manifested in prophecy and sacred song.</p>
      <p>Music was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts to that which is pure, noble, and elevating, and
          to awaken in the soul devotion and gratitude to God. What a contrast between the ancient custom and the uses
          to which music is now too often devoted! How many employ this gift to exalt self, instead of using it to
          glorify God! A love for music leads the unwary to unite with world lovers in pleasure gatherings where God has
          forbidden His children to go. Thus that which is a great blessing when rightly used, becomes one of the most
          successful agencies by which Satan allures the mind from duty and from the contemplation of eternal
          things.</p>
      <p>Music forms a part of God’s worship in the courts above, and we should endeavor, in our songs of praise, to
          approach as nearly as possible to the harmony of the heavenly choirs. The proper training of the voice is an
          important feature in education, and should not be neglected. Singing, as a part of religious service, is as
          much an act of worship as is <nobr>prayer.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 594.</p>
