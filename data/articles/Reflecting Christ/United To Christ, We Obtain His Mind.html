    <h1>United To Christ, We Obtain His Mind</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The wisdom that is from above is ﬁrst pure, then peaceable, gentle and easy to be intreated, full of
          mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in
          peace of them that make peace. James 3:17, 18.</strong></p>
      <p>Wherever there is union with Christ there is love. Whatever other fruits we may bear, if love be missing, they
          proﬁt nothing. Love to God and our neighbor is the very essence of our religion. No one can love Christ and
          not love His children. When we are united to Christ, we have the mind of Christ. Purity and love shine forth
          in the character, meekness and truth control the life. The very expression of the countenance is changed.</p>
      <p>Christ abiding in the soul exerts a transforming power, and the outward aspect bears witness to the peace and
          joy that reign within. We drink in the love of Christ, as the branch draws nourishment from the vine. If we
          are grafted in Christ, if ﬁber by ﬁber we have been united with the Living Vine, we shall give evidence of the
          fact by bearing rich clusters of living fruit. If we are connected with the Light, we shall be channels of
          light, and in our words and works we shall reﬂect light to the world.</p>
      <p>Those who are truly Christians are bound with the chain of love which links earth to heaven, which binds ﬁnite
          man to the inﬁnite God. The light that shines in the face of Jesus Christ shines in the hearts of His
          followers, to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>By beholding we are to become changed; and as we meditate upon the perfections of the divine Model, we shall
          desire to become wholly transformed, and renewed in the image of His purity. It is by faith in the Son of God
          that transformation takes place in the character, and the child of wrath becomes the child of God. He passes
          from death unto life; he becomes spiritual and discerns spiritual things. The wisdom of God enlightens his
          mind, and he beholds wondrous things out of His law.... In becoming a man of obedience to God, he has</p>
      <p>the mind of Christ, and the will of God becomes his will.</p>
      <p>He who places himself unreservedly under the guidance of the Spirit of God will ﬁnd that his mind expands and
          develops. He obtains an education in the service of God which is not <nobr>one-sided</nobr> and deﬁcient,
          developing a <nobr>one-sided</nobr> character, but one which results in symmetry and completeness. Weaknesses
          that have been manifested in a vacillating will and powerless character are overcome, for continual devotion
          and piety bring the man in such close relation to Christ that he has the mind of Christ. He is one with
          Christ, having soundness and strength of <nobr>principle.—Selected</nobr> Messages
