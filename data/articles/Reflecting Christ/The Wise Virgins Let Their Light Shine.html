    <h1>The Wise Virgins Let Their Light Shine</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Matthew 25:4.</strong></p>
      <p>In the parable the wise virgins had oil in their vessels with their lamps. Their light burned with undimmed
          ﬂame through the night of watching. It helped to swell the illumination for the bridegroom’s honor. Shining
          out in the darkness, it helped to illuminate the way to the home of the bridegroom, to the marriage
          feast.</p>
      <p>So the followers of Christ are to shed light into the darkness of the world. Through the Holy Spirit, God’s
          Word is a light as it becomes a transforming power in the life of the receiver. By implanting in their hearts
          the principles of His Word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes of God. The light of His
          <nobr>glory—His</nobr><nobr>character—is</nobr> to shine forth in His followers. Thus they are to glorify God,
          to lighten the path to the Bridegroom’s home, to the city of God, to the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>
      <p>The coming of the bridegroom was at <nobr>midnight—the</nobr> darkest hour. So the coming of Christ will take
          place in the darkest period of this earth’s history. The days of Noah and Lot picture the condition of the
          world just before the coming of the Son of man. The Scriptures pointing forward to this time declare that
          Satan will work with all power and “with all deceivableness of unrighteousness” (2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10). His
          working is plainly revealed by the rapidly increasing darkness, the multitudinous errors, heresies, and
          delusions of these last days. Not only is Satan leading the world captive, but his deceptions are leavening
          the professed churches of our Lord Jesus Christ. The great apostasy will develop into darkness deep as
          midnight, impenetrable as sackcloth of hair. To God’s people it will be a night of trial, a night of weeping,
          a night of persecution for the truth’s sake. But out of that night of darkness God’s light will shine.</p>
      <p>He causes “the light to shine out of darkness” (2 Corinthians 4:6). When “the earth was without form, and void;
          and darkness was upon the face of the deep,” “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God
          said, Let there be light: and there was light” (Genesis 1:2, 3). So in the night of spiritual darkness, God’s
          Word goes forth, “Let there be light.” To His people He says, “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the
          glory of the Lord is risen upon thee” (Isaiah 60:1).</p>
      <p>“Behold,” says the Scripture, “the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord
          shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee” (verse <nobr>2).—Christ’s</nobr> Object Lessons,
          414, 415.</p>
