    <h1>The Truth of God Reﬁnes the Taste</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. 1 Corinthians
          13:4, 5, R.S.V.</strong></p>
      <p>The truth of God is designed to elevate the receiver, to reﬁne his taste, and to sanctify his judgment. The
          character of the Christian should be holy, his manners comely, his words without guile. There should be a
          continual effort to imitate the society he hopes soon to join, that of angels who have never fallen by
          sin.</p>
      <p>No man can be a Christian without having the Spirit of Christ; and if he has the Spirit of Christ, it will be
          manifested in kind words and a reﬁned, courteous deportment.... External</p>
      <p>change will testify to an internal change. The truth is the sanctiﬁer, the reﬁner. Received into the heart, it
          works with hidden power, transforming the character. But those who profess to be followers of Christ, and are
          at the same time rough, unkind, and uncourteous in words and deportment, have not learned of Jesus. A
          blustering, overbearing, faultﬁnding man is not a Christian; for to be a Christian is to be
          Christlike....</p>
      <p>Very many who are seeking for happiness will be disappointed in their hopes, because they seek it amiss, and
          are indulging in sinful tempers and selﬁsh feelings. By neglecting to discharge the little duties and observe
          the little courtesies of life, they violate the principles on which happiness depends. True happiness is not
          to be found in <nobr>self-gratiﬁcation,</nobr> but in the path of duty. God desires man to be happy, and for
          this reason He gave him the precepts of His Law, that in obeying these he might have joy at home and abroad.
          While he stands in his moral integrity, true to principle, and having the control of all his powers, he cannot
          be miserable. With its tendrils twined about God, the heart will be full of peace and joy, and the soul will
          ﬂourish amid unbelief and depravity.</p>
      <p>Kind words, pleasant looks, a cheerful countenance, throw a charm around the Christian that makes his inﬂuence
          almost irresistible. It is the religion of Christ in the heart that causes the words to be gentle, and the
          demeanor winning, even to those in the humblest walks of life. In forgetfulness of self, in the light and
          peace and happiness he is constantly bestowing on others, is seen the true dignity of the man. This is a way
          to gain respect, and extend the sphere of usefulness, which costs but little; and the one who pursues this
          course will not complain that he does not receive the honor that is his due. But Bible rules must be written
          on the heart; Bible rules must be carried into the everyday <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times,
          November 11, 1886.</p>
