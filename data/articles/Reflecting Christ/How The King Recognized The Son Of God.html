    <h1>How The King Recognized The Son Of God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Daniel 3:26.</strong></p>
      <p>How did that heathen king know what the Son of God was like? The Hebrew captives ﬁlling positions of trust in
          Babylon had in life and character represented before him the truth. When asked for a reason of their faith,
          they had given it without hesitation. Plainly and simply they had presented the principles of righteousness,
          thus teaching those around them of God whom they worshiped. They had told of Christ, the Redeemer to come; and
          in the form of the fourth in the midst of the ﬁre the king recognized the Son of God....</p>
      <p>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth before the vast multitude, showing themselves unhurt. The
          presence of their Saviour had guarded them from harm, and only their fetters had been burned. “And the
          princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
          whose bodies the ﬁre had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor
          the smell of ﬁre had passed on them.” ...</p>
      <p>The experiences of that day led Nebuchadnezzar to issue a decree, “That every people, nation, and language,
          which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and
          their houses shall be made a dunghill.” “There is no other God,” he urged as the reason for the decree, “that
          can deliver after this sort.”</p>
      <p>In these and like words the king of Babylon endeavored to spread abroad before all the peoples of earth his
          conviction that the power and authority of the God of the Hebrews was worthy of supreme adoration. And God was
          pleased with the effort of the king to show Him reverence, and to make the royal confession of allegiance as
          widespread as was the Babylonian realm.</p>
      <p>It was right for the king to make public confession, and to seek to exalt the God of heaven above all other
          gods; but in endeavoring to force his subjects to make a similar confession of faith and to show similar
          reverence, Nebuchadnezzar was exceeding his right as a temporal sovereign. He had no more right, either civil
          or moral, to threaten men with death for not worshiping God, than he had to make a decree consigning to the
          ﬂames all who refused to worship the golden image. God never compels the obedience of man. He leaves all free
          to choose whom they will <nobr>serve.—Prophets</nobr> and Kings, <nobr>509-511.</nobr></p>
