      <p><strong>Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctiﬁcation,
          and redemption. 1 Corinthians 1:30.</strong></p>
      <p>Many think that it is impossible to love our neighbor as ourselves; but it is the only genuine fruit of
          Christianity. Love to others is putting on the Lord Jesus Christ; it is walking and working with the invisible
          world in view. We are thus to keep looking unto Jesus, the author and ﬁnisher of our faith.</p>
      <p>The solemn warning that was given to the foolish rich man should be a sufﬁcient warning for all men to the
          close of time. Lesson upon lesson was given by our Lord to take everyone away from selﬁshness, and to
          establish close bonds of fellowship and brotherhood between man and man. He desired that the hearts of
          believers should be closely knit together in strong bonds of sympathy, so that there might be unity in
          Himself. They are together to rejoice in hope of the glory of God, looking for eternal life through the virtue
          of Jesus Christ. If Christ is abiding in the heart, His love will diffuse itself to others through its
          possessor, and will bind heart to heart.</p>
      <p>The grace of Christ must be the sole dependence of the Christian, and when it is, he will love his brethren as
          Christ loved him. Then he can say, “Come,” and beseech and woo souls, entreating them to be reconciled to God.
          His inﬂuence will be more and more decided, and he will devote his life to Christ, who was cruciﬁed for
          him.</p>
      <p>Where love is perfected, the law is kept, and self ﬁnds no place. Those who love God supremely, work, suffer,
          and live for Him who gave His life for them. We can keep the law only through making the righteousness of
          Christ our own. Christ says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” When we receive the heavenly gift, the
          righteousness of Christ, we shall ﬁnd that divine grace has been provided for us, and that human resources are
          powerless. Jesus gives the Holy Spirit in large measure for great emergencies, to help our inﬁrmities, to give
          us strong consolation, to illuminate our minds, and purify and ennoble our hearts. Christ becomes unto us
          wisdom, righteousness, sanctiﬁcation, and redemption.</p>
      <p>From the ﬁrst to the last of the Christian life, not one successful step can be taken without Christ. He has
          sent His Spirit to be with us constantly, and by conﬁding in Christ to the uttermost, surrendering our will to
          Him, we may follow Him whithersoever He <nobr>goeth.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, June 26, 1894.</p>
      <p>The Holy Spirit will work every heart susceptible to its holy inﬂuence. Christ’s righteousness will go before
          such an one, and the glory of the Lord will be his <nobr>rearward.—Letter</nobr> 192, 1902.</p>
