    <h1>The World Needs People of Noble Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye
          shall receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ. Colossians 3:23, 24.</strong></p>
      <p>True education does not ignore the value of scientiﬁc knowledge or literary acquirements; but above information
          it values power; above power, goodness; above intellectual acquirements, character. The world does not so much
          need men of great intellect as of a noble character. It needs men in whom ability is controlled by steadfast
          principle.</p>
      <p>“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom” (Proverbs 4:7). “The tongue of the wise useth knowledge
          aright” (chap. 15:2). True education imparts this wisdom. It teaches the best use not only of one but of all
          our powers and acquirements. Thus it covers the whole circle of <nobr>obligation—to</nobr> ourselves, to the
          world, and to God.</p>
      <p>Character building is the most important work ever entrusted to human beings; and never before was its diligent
          study so important as now. Never was any previous generation called to meet issues so momentous; never before
          were young men and young women confronted by perils so great as confront them today....</p>
      <p>In true education the selﬁsh ambition, the greed for power, the disregard for the rights and needs of humanity,
          that are the curse of our world, ﬁnd a counterinﬂuence. God’s plan of life has a place for every human being.
          Each is to improve his talents to the utmost; and faithfulness in doing this, be the gifts few or many,
          entitles one to honor. In God’s plan there is no place for selﬁsh rivalry. Those who measure themselves by
          themselves, and compare themselves among themselves, are not wise (2 Corinthians 10:12). Whatever we do is to
          be done “as of the ability which God giveth” (1 Peter 4:11)....</p>
      <p>In every generation and in every land the true foundation and pattern for character building have been the
          same. The divine law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart ...; and thy neighbour as thyself”
          (Luke 10:27), the great principle made manifest in the character and life of our Saviour, is the only secure
          foundation and the only sure guide....</p>
      <p>It is as true now as when the words were spoken to Israel of obedience to His commandments: “This is your
          wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations” (Deuteronomy 4:6).</p>
      <p>Here is the only safeguard for individual integrity, for the purity of the home, the <nobr>well-being</nobr> of
          society, or the stability of the nation. Amidst all life’s perplexities and dangers and conﬂicting claims the
          one safe and sure rule is to do what God <nobr>says.—Education,</nobr><nobr>225-229.</nobr></p>
