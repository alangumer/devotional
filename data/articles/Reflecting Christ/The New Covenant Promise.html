    <h1>The New Covenant Promise</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws
          into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no
          more. Hebrews 10:16, 17.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the Creator of men, the Giver of the law, who declares that it is not His purpose to set aside its
          precepts. Everything in nature, from the mote in the sunbeam to the worlds on high, is under law. And upon
          obedience to these laws the order and harmony of the natural world depend. So there are great principles of
          righteousness to control the life of all intelligent beings, and upon conformity to these principles the
          <nobr>well-being</nobr> of the universe depends.</p>
      <p>Before this earth was called into being, God’s law existed. Angels are governed by its principles, and in order
          for earth to be in harmony with heaven, man also must obey the divine statutes. To man in Eden Christ made
          known the precepts of the law “when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy”
          (Job 38:7). The mission of Christ on earth was not to destroy the law, but by His grace to bring man back to
          obedience to its precepts.</p>
      <p>The beloved disciple, who listened to the words of Jesus on the mount, writing long afterward under the
          inspiration of the Holy Spirit, speaks of the law as of perpetual obligation. He says that “sin is the
          transgression of the law” and that “whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law” (1 John 3:4). He
          makes it plain that the law to which he refers is “an old commandment which ye had from the beginning” (chap.
          2:7). He is speaking of the law that existed at the creation and was reiterated upon Mount Sinai....</p>
      <p>He [Jesus] was to show the spiritual nature of the law, to present its <nobr>far-reaching</nobr> principles,
          and to make plain its eternal obligation.</p>
      <p>The divine beauty of the character of Christ, of whom the noblest and most gentle among men are but a faint
          reﬂection; of whom Solomon by the Spirit of inspiration wrote, He is “the chiefest among ten thousand.... Yea,
          he is altogether lovely” (Song of Solomon <nobr>5:10-16);</nobr></p>
      <p>of whom David, seeing Him in prophetic vision, said, “Thou art fairer than the children of men” (Psalm 45:2);
          Jesus, the express image of the Father’s person, the effulgence of His glory; the <nobr>self-denying</nobr>
          Redeemer, throughout His pilgrimage of love on earth, was a living representation of the character of the law
          of God. In His life it is made manifest that <nobr>heaven-born</nobr> love, Christlike principles, underlie
          the laws of eternal rectitude....</p>
      <p>Those principles that were made known to man in Paradise as the great law of life will exist unchanged in
          Paradise <nobr>restored.—Thoughts</nobr> from the Mount of Blessing, <nobr>48-51.</nobr></p>
