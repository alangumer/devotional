    <h1>Treasures of Divine Grace at Our Disposal</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Every man that hath this hope in him puriﬁeth himself, even as he is pure, 1 John 3:3.</strong></p>
      <p>It is the privilege of every earnest seeker for truth and righteousness, to rely upon the sure promises of God.
          The Lord Jesus makes manifest the fact that the treasures of divine grace are placed entirely at our disposal,
          in order that we may become channels of light. We cannot receive the riches of the grace of Christ without
          desiring to impart them to others. When we have the love of Christ in our hearts, we shall feel that it is our
          duty and privilege to communicate it.</p>
      <p>The sun shining in the heavens, pours its bright beams into all the highways and byways of life. It has
          sufﬁcient light for thousands of worlds like ours. And so it is with the Sun of Righteousness; His bright
          beams of healing and gladness are amply sufﬁcient to save our little world, and are efﬁcacious in establishing
          security in every world that has been created. Christ declares that our heavenly Father is more willing to
          give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than earthly parents are to give gifts to their children.</p>
      <p>The day of Pentecost furnished a wonderful occasion. In the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, what a testimony was
          given to the abundance of the grace of Christ! Why is it that those who claim to believe advanced truth live
          so far beneath their privileges? Why do they mingle self with all they do? If they will cast out self, Jesus
          will pour into the thirsty soul a constant supply from the river of life....</p>
      <p>It is growth in knowledge of the character of Christ that sanctiﬁes the soul. To discern and appreciate the
          wonderful work of the atonement, transforms him who contemplates the plan of salvation. By beholding Christ,
          he becomes changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. The beholding of
          Jesus becomes an ennobling, reﬁning process to the actual Christian. He sees the Pattern, and grows into its
          likeness, and then how easily are dissensions, emulations, and strife adjusted. The perfection of Christ’s
          character is the Christian’s inspiration. When we see Him as He is, desire awakes to be like Him, and this
          elevates the whole man; for “every man that hath this hope in him puriﬁeth himself, even as He is pure.”
          ...</p>
      <p>The power of Christ is to be the comfort, the hope, the crown of rejoicing, of everyone that follows Jesus in
          his conﬂict, in his struggles in <nobr>life.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August 26, 1890.</p>
