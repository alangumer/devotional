    <h1>God’s Grace Sweetens Every Afﬂiction</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he
          taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. John
          15:1, 2.</strong></p>
      <p>“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you.” The very same sap
          and nourishment that nourishes the parent stock, nourishes the branch abiding in the vine. Christ is
          represented by the vine that imparts the nourishment, the vitality, the life, the spirit, the power, that the
          branch can bear fruit, and then when afﬂiction and disappointment come, you are to show altogether a different
          character of fruit than the world. There is the evidence that you are connected with Jesus Christ, and that
          there is a power that sustains you in all your afﬂictions and disappointments and trials; and this power and
          this grace sweetens every afﬂiction. [When] the cup of suffering may be placed to your lips, there is a
          Comforter and Helper. The cup of consolation is placed in the hand, and it may be the happiest period of your
          life.</p>
      <p>“Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can
          ye, except ye abide in me.”... Here are the most precious jewels of truth for every individual soul of us.
          Here is the only election in the Bible, and you can prove yourself elected of Christ by being faithful; you
          can prove yourself the chosen of Christ by abiding in the vine....</p>
      <p>Christ tells us plainly that the whole power, the whole <nobr>fruit-bearing</nobr> quality, is in the parent
          vine stock. Then let them be abiding in Christ, and drawing the nourishment from Christ, and what shall we
          see? We shall see something, the world will see something. There is a clear line of distinction between the
          believing and the unbelieving, between those that obey God, and those that disobey Him; there is a decided and
          marked difference in the fruit they bear.... The fruit is the character....</p>
      <p>Every ability that you have, every power that you have, your reasoning powers every talent that you have, every
          capability that you have, is to be brought right into the religious life, and the kindness, the compassion,
          the pitifulness, the love of God, is the fruit borne upon the branch that is grafted into the living Vine. And
          then as the rich clusters ... bow down that branch, showing that those that bear the most fruit, the richest
          clusters, have the true humility of lowliness, like Christ. He says, Learn of Me. Come unto Me. Now let us
          everyone hear it. It is the invitation not from the speaker, but it is the invitation from Jesus Christ
          Himself.— Manuscript 43, 1894.</p>
