    <h1>Wait and Watch and Pray</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.
          Psalm 27:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Wait on the Lord, and again I say, Wait on the Lord. We may ask of the human agents and not receive. We may ask
          of God and He says, Ye shall receive. Therefore you know to whom to look; you know in whom to trust. You must
          not trust in man or make ﬂesh your arm. Lean as heavily as you please upon the Mighty One who hath said, “Let
          him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.” Then wait and
          watch and pray and work, keeping your face constantly turned to the Sun of Righteousness.</p>
      <p>Let the bright beams from the face of Jesus shine into your hearts, to shine upon others through you. “Ye are
          the light of the world.... Let your light so shine before men, that they</p>
      <p>may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew <nobr>5:14-16).</nobr> We must
          lift up Jesus before the people....</p>
      <p>Just as sure as you depend on man to be appreciated and to sustain you, you will be wholly disappointed. Your
          encouragement and sustaining will not come from the very best of men. The Lord has a lesson to teach you, to
          depend on Him alone, for He is your Redeemer. You are His <nobr>property—His</nobr> by creation and by
          redemption. The way of the Lord is to be chosen, the will of the Lord is to be your will....</p>
      <p>The Holy One has given us rules for the guidance of all. These rules form the standard from which there can be
          no departure. The principles of holiness have yet to be learned daily, and then the will of God will become
          paramount. In God you can stand, in God you can make aggressive warfare, presenting the truth as it is in
          Jesus.</p>
      <p>Do not feel at all ashamed of the heart softening under the movings of the Holy Spirit. Let Jesus come in as He
          knocks for entrance and then appreciate Him, rejoice in heart, encourage a constant gratitude that while you
          felt that there was no arm to save, His arm brought salvation, His love was made apparent to you. Then when in
          the full joy of that love you presented Jesus to others, the Holy Spirit was working through you ... to bless
          others....</p>
      <p>It is the privilege of everyone who receives the Spirit of truth to represent the truth in its simplicity, to
          reach the hearts of the perplexed, trembling souls who are really bewildered....</p>
      <p>He knows how to apply the balm....</p>
      <p>Make God your entire trust. Pray, pray, pray, pray in faith. Trust then the keeping of your soul to God. He
          will keep that which is committed to Him against that day.... Trust</p>
      <p>fully, unwaveringly in <nobr>God.—Letter</nobr> 126, 1895.</p>
