    <h1>Gideon Leads Three Hundred Men to Victory</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand
          of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? Judges 6:14.</strong></p>
      <p>Gideon was the son of Joash, of the tribe of Manasseh. The division to which this family belonged held no
          leading position, but the household of Joash was distinguished for courage and integrity.... To Gideon came
          the divine call to deliver his people....</p>
      <p>Suddenly the “angel of the Lord” appeared and addressed him with the words, “Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty
          man of valor.”</p>
      <p>“Oh my Lord,” was his answer, “if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?”</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>The Messenger of heaven replied, “Go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the
          Midianites; have not I sent thee?”</p>
      <p>The entire force under Gideon’s command numbered only <nobr>thirty-two</nobr> thousand men; but with the vast
          host of the enemy spread out before him, the word of the Lord came to him: “The people that are with thee are
          too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying, Mine
          own hand hath saved me. Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful
          and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.” ...</p>
      <p>Gideon obeyed the Lord’s direction, and with a heavy heart he saw <nobr>twenty-two</nobr> thousand, or more
          than two thirds of his entire force, depart for their homes. Again the word of the Lord came to him: “The
          people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee.” ... A few hastily took
          a little water in the hand and sucked it up as they went on; but nearly all bowed upon their knees, and
          leisurely drank from the surface of the stream. Those who took the water in their hands were but three hundred
          out of ten thousand; yet these were selected; all the rest were permitted to return to their homes. By the
          simplest means character is often tested....</p>
      <p>The three hundred chosen men not only possessed courage and <nobr>self-control,</nobr> but they were men of
          faith.... God could direct them....</p>
      <p>In the dead of the night, at a signal from Gideon’s war horn, the three companies sounded their trumpets; then,
          breaking their pitchers and displaying the blazing torches, they rushed upon the enemy with the terrible war
          cry, “The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!” ... One hundred and twenty thousand of the invaders perished....
          No words can describe the terror</p>
      <p>of the surrounding nations when they learned what simple means had prevailed against the power of a bold,
          warlike <nobr>people.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, <nobr>546-553.</nobr></p>
