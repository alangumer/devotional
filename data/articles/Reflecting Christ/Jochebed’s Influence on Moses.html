    <h1>Jochebed’s Inﬂuence on Moses</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing
          rather to suffer afﬂiction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Hebrews
          11:24, 25.</strong></p>
      <p>Younger than Joseph or Daniel was Moses when removed from the sheltering care of his childhood home; yet
          already the same agencies that shaped their lives had molded his. Only twelve years did he spend with his
          Hebrew kindred; but during these years was laid the foundation of his greatness; it was laid by the hand of
          one little known to fame.</p>
      <p>Jochebed was a woman and a slave. Her lot in life was humble, her burden heavy. But through no other woman,
          save Mary of Nazareth, has the world received greater blessing. Knowing that her child must soon pass beyond
          her care, to the guardianship of those who knew not God, she the more earnestly endeavored to link his soul
          with heaven. She sought to implant in his heart love and loyalty to God. And faithfully was the work
          accomplished. Those principles of truth that were the burden of his mother’s teaching and the lesson of her
          life, no after inﬂuence could induce Moses to renounce.</p>
      <p>From the humble home in Goshen the son of Jochebed passed to the palace of the Pharaohs, to the Egyptian
          princess, by her to be welcomed as a loved and cherished son. In the schools of Egypt, Moses received the
          highest civil and military training. Of great personal attractions, noble in form and stature, of cultivated
          mind and princely bearing, and renowned as military leader, he became the nation’s pride. The king of Egypt
          was also a member of the priesthood; and Moses, though refusing to participate in the heathen worship, was
          initiated into all the mysteries of the Egyptian religion.</p>
      <p>Egypt at this time being still the most powerful and most highly civilized of nations, Moses, as its
          prospective sovereign, was heir to the highest honors this world could bestow. But his was a nobler choice.
          For the honor of God and the deliverance of His downtrodden people, Moses sacriﬁced the honors of Egypt. Then,
          in a special sense, God undertook his training....</p>
      <p>He had yet to learn the lesson of dependence upon divine power.... In the wilds of</p>
      <p>Midian, Moses spent forty years as a keeper of sheep.... In the care of the sheep and the</p>
      <p>tender lambs he must obtain the experience that would make him a faithful, <nobr>long-suffering</nobr> shepherd
          to Israel....</p>
      <p>Amidst the solemn majesty of the mountain solitudes, Moses was alone with God....</p>
      <p>Here his <nobr>self-sufﬁciency</nobr> was swept <nobr>away.—Education,</nobr><nobr>61-63.</nobr></p>
      <p>The greatness of Egypt is in the dust.... But the work of Moses can never perish. The</p>
      <p>great principles of righteousness which he lived to establish are <nobr>eternal.—Education,</nobr> 69.</p>
