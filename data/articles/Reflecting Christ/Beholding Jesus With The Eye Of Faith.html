    <h1>Beholding Jesus With The Eye Of Faith</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians
          15:57.</strong></p>
      <p>By faith look upon the crowns laid up for those who shall overcome; listen to the exultant song of the
          redeemed, Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain and hast redeemed us to God! Endeavor to regard these
          scenes as real.</p>
      <p>Stephen, the ﬁrst Christian martyr, in his terrible conﬂict with principalities and powers and spiritual
          wickedness in high places exclaimed, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the
          right hand of God” (Acts 7:56). The Saviour of the world was revealed to him as looking down from heaven upon
          him with the deepest interest, and the glorious light of Christ’s countenance shone upon Stephen with such
          brightness that even his enemies saw his face shine like the face of an angel.</p>
      <p>If we would permit our minds to dwell more upon Christ and the heavenly world, we should ﬁnd a powerful
          stimulus and support in ﬁghting the battles of the Lord. Pride and love of the world will lose their power as
          we contemplate the glories of that better land so soon to be our home. Beside the loveliness of Christ, all
          earthly attractions will seem of little worth.</p>
      <p>Let none imagine that without earnest effort on their part they can obtain the assurance of God’s love. When
          the mind has been long permitted to dwell only on earthly things, it is a difﬁcult matter to change the habits
          of thought. That which the eye sees and the ear hears too often attracts the attention and absorbs the
          interest. But if we would enter the city of God, and look upon Jesus and His glory, we must become accustomed
          to beholding Him with the eye of faith here. The words and the character of Christ should be often the subject
          of our thoughts and of our conversation, and each day some time should be especially devoted to prayerful
          meditation upon these sacred themes.</p>
      <p>Sanctiﬁcation is a daily work. Let none deceive themselves with the belief that God will pardon and bless them
          while they are trampling upon one of His requirements. The willful commission of a known sin silences the
          witnessing voice of the Spirit and separates the soul from God.</p>
      <p>Whatever may be the ecstasies of religious feeling, Jesus cannot abide in the heart that disregards the divine
          law. God will honor those only who honor Him.... Here is where</p>
      <p>Christ’s help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith exclaims, “Thanks be to
          God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians <nobr>15:57)!—The</nobr>
          Sanctiﬁed Life, <nobr>91-93.</nobr></p>
