    <h1>God Works On Plan Of Multiplication</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord. 2 Peter
          1:2.</strong></p>
      <p>If we would develop a character which God can accept, we must form correct habits in our religious life. Daily
          prayer is as essential to growth in grace, and even to spiritual life itself, as is temporal food to physical
          <nobr>well-being.</nobr> We should accustom ourselves to lift the thoughts often to God in prayer. If the mind
          wanders, we must bring it back; by persevering effort, habit will ﬁnally make it easy. We cannot for one
          moment separate ourselves from Christ with safety. We may have His presence to attend us at every step, but
          only by observing the conditions which He Himself has laid down.</p>
      <p>Religion must be made the great business of life. Everything else should be held subordinate to this. All our
          powers, of soul, body, and spirit, must be engaged in the Christian warfare. We must look to Christ for
          strength and grace, and we shall gain the victory as surely as Jesus died for us.</p>
      <p>We must come nearer to the cross of Christ. Penitence at the foot of the cross is the ﬁrst lesson of peace we
          have to learn. The love of <nobr>Jesus—who</nobr> can comprehend it? Inﬁnitely more tender and
          <nobr>self-denying</nobr> than a mother’s love! If we would know the value of a human soul, we must look in
          living faith upon the cross, and thus begin the study which shall be the science and the song of the redeemed
          through all eternity. The value of our time and our talents can be estimated only by the greatness of the
          ransom paid for our redemption....</p>
      <p>Sanctiﬁcation is a progressive work. The successive steps are set before us in the words of Peter: “Giving all
          diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance
          patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
          For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
          knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter <nobr>1:5-8)....</nobr></p>
      <p>Here is a course by which we may be assured that we shall never fall. Those who are thus working upon the plan
          of addition in obtaining the Christian graces have the assurance that God will work upon the plan of
          multiplication in granting them the gifts of His Spirit....</p>
      <p>By divine grace, all who will may climb the shining steps from earth to heaven, and at last, “with songs and
          everlasting joy” (Isaiah 35:10), enter through the gates into the city of <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Sanctiﬁed
          Life, <nobr>93-95.</nobr></p>
