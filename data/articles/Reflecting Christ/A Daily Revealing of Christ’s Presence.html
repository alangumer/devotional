    <h1>A Daily Revealing of Christ’s Presence</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. Proverbs
          4:18.</strong></p>
      <p>We must turn away from a thousand topics that invite attention. There are matters that consume time and arouse
          inquiry, but end in nothing. The highest interests demand the close attention and energy that are too often
          given to comparatively insigniﬁcant things.</p>
      <p>Accepting new theories does not bring new life to the soul. Even an acquaintance with facts and theories
          important in themselves is of little value unless put to a practical use. We need to feel our responsibility
          to give our souls food that will nourish and stimulate spiritual life....</p>
      <p>We are not doing the will of God when we speculate upon things that He has seen ﬁt to withhold from us. The
          question for us to study is: “What is truth, the truth for this time, which is to be cherished, loved,
          honored, and obeyed?” The devotees of science have been defeated and disheartened in their efforts to ﬁnd out
          God. What they need to inquire at this time is: “What is the truth that will enable us to win the salvation of
          our souls?”</p>
      <p>Christ revealed God to His disciples in a way that performed in their hearts a special work, such as He has
          long been urging us to allow Him to do in our hearts. There are many who, in dwelling too largely upon theory,
          have lost sight of the living power of the Saviour’s example. They have lost sight of Him as the humble,
          <nobr>self-denying</nobr> worker. What they need is to behold Jesus. Daily we need the fresh revealing of His
          presence. We need to follow more closely His example of <nobr>self-renunciation</nobr> and sacriﬁce.</p>
      <p>We need the experience that Paul had when he wrote: “I am cruciﬁed with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
          but Christ liveth in me” (Galatians 2:20).</p>
      <p>The knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ expressed in character is an exaltation above everything else that is
          esteemed on earth or in heaven. It is the very highest education. It is the key that opens the portals of the
          heavenly city. This knowledge it is God’s purpose that all who put on Christ shall possess....</p>
      <p>Treasure every ray of light. Cherish every desire of the soul after God. Give yourselves the culture of
          spiritual thoughts and holy communings.... Having repented of our sins,</p>
      <p>confessed them, and found pardon, we are to continue to learn of Christ until we come into the full noontide of
          a perfect gospel <nobr>faith.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church <nobr>8:316-318.</nobr></p>
