      <p><strong>Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean things; and I
          will receive you. 2 Corinthians 6:17.</strong></p>
      <p>Professed Christians yearly expend an immense sum upon useless and pernicious indulgences, while souls are
          perishing for the Word of life. God is robbed in tithes and offerings, while they consume upon the altar of
          destroying lust more than they give to relieve the poor or for the support of the gospel. If all who profess
          to be followers of Christ were truly sanctiﬁed, their means, instead of being spent for needless and even
          hurtful indulgences, would be turned into the Lord’s treasury, and Christians would set an example of
          temperance, <nobr>self-denial,</nobr> and <nobr>self-sacriﬁce.</nobr> Then they would be the light of the
          world.</p>
      <p>The world is given up to <nobr>self-indulgence.</nobr> “The lust of the ﬂesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the
          pride of life” control the masses of the people. But Christ’s followers have a holier calling. “Come out from
          among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.” In the light of God’s Word we are
          justiﬁed in declaring that sanctiﬁcation cannot be genuine which does not work this utter renunciation of the
          sinful pursuits and gratiﬁcations of the world.</p>
      <p>To those who comply with the conditions, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate,... and touch not the
          unclean,” God’s promise is, “I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
          daughters, saith the Lord Almighty” (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18). It is the privilege and duty of every Christian
          to have a rich and abundant experience in the things of God. “I am the light of the world,” said Jesus. “He
          that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). “The path of the
          just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day” (Proverbs 4:18). Every step of
          faith and obedience brings the soul into closer connection with the Light of the world, in whom there is “no
          darkness at all.” The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon the servants of God, and they are to
          reﬂect His rays. As the stars tell us that there is a great light in heaven with whose glory they are made
          bright, so Christians are to make it manifest that there is a God on the throne of the universe whose
          character is worthy of praise and imitation. The graces of His Spirit, the purity and holiness of His
          character, will be manifest in His <nobr>witnesses.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 475, 476.</p>
      <p>Our work in this world is to reveal the pure principles that are current in <nobr>heaven.—The</nobr> Upward
          Look, 291.</p>
