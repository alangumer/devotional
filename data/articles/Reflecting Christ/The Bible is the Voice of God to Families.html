    <h1>The Bible is the Voice of God to Families</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord. Psalm 127:3.</strong></p>
      <p>Parents need to reform; ministers need to reform; they need God in their households. If they would see a
          different state of things, they must bring His Word into their families and must make it their counselor. They
          must teach their children that it is the voice of God addressed to them, and is to be implicitly obeyed. They
          should patiently instruct their children, kindly and untiringly teach them how to live in order to please God.
          The children of such a household are prepared to meet the sophistries of inﬁdelity. They have accepted the
          Bible as the basis of their faith, and they have a foundation that cannot be swept away by the incoming tide
          of skepticism.</p>
      <p>In too many households prayer is neglected. Parents feel that they have no time for morning and evening
          worship. They cannot spare a few moments to be spent in thanksgiving to God for His abundant
          <nobr>mercies—for</nobr> the blessed sunshine and the showers of rain, which cause vegetation to ﬂourish, and
          for the guardianship of holy angels. They have no time to offer prayer for divine help and guidance and for
          the abiding presence of Jesus in the household. They go forth to labor...without one thought of God or heaven.
          They have souls so precious that rather than permit them to be hopelessly lost, the Son of God gave His life
          to ransom them....</p>
      <p>Like the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God should erect an altar to the Lord wherever they pitch
          their tent. If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of prayer, it is now. Fathers and
          mothers should often lift up their hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and their children. Let
          the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacriﬁce, while the
          wife and children unite in prayer and praise. In such a household Jesus will love to tarry.</p>
      <p>From every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love should be revealed in action. It should ﬂow out
          in all home intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselﬁsh courtesy. There are homes
          where this principle is carried <nobr>out—homes</nobr> where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From
          these homes morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense, and His mercies and blessings descend
          upon the suppliants like the morning <nobr>dew.—Patriarchs</nobr> and Prophets, 143, 144.</p>
      <p>That which will make the character lovely in the home is that which will make it lovely in the heavenly
          <nobr>mansions.—Child</nobr> Guidance, 481.</p>
