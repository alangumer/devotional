    <h1>We Rejoice in Tribulation</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our inﬁrmities; but was in
          all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 4:15.</strong></p>
      <p>Praise the Lord, that we have a compassionate, tender High Priest that can be touched with the feelings of our
          inﬁrmities. We do not expect rest here. No, no. The way to heaven is a <nobr>cross-bearing</nobr> way; the
          road is straight and narrow, but we will go forward with cheerfulness knowing that the King of glory once trod
          this way before us.</p>
      <p>We will not complain of the roughness of the way, but will be meek followers of Jesus, treading in His
          footsteps. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He for our sakes became poor that we through His
          poverty might be made rich. We will rejoice in tribulation and keep in mind the recompense of reward, the “far
          more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”</p>
      <p>We will not have a murmuring thought because we have trials. God’s dear children always had them, and every
          trial well endured here, will only make us rich in glory. I crave the suffering part. I would not go to heaven
          without suffering if I could, and see Jesus who suffered so much for us to purchase for us so rich an
          inheritance; and to see the martyrs who laid down their lives for the truth, and the sake of Jesus. No, no.
          Let me [be] perfected through sufferings. I long to be a partaker with Christ of His sufferings, for if I am,
          I know I shall be a partaker with Him of His glory. Jesus is our pattern. Let us study to have our lives as
          near like Christ’s as possible.</p>
      <p>My soul cries out after the living God. My very being longs after Him. Oh, for to reﬂect His lovely image
          perfectly! Oh, for to be wholly consecrated to Him! Oh, how hard it is for dear self to die. We can rejoice in
          a whole Saviour; one who saves us from all sin. We can be shut in with God where we can daily say, “I live;
          yet not I, but Christ liveth in me” “to will and to do of his good pleasure.” Glory be to God. I know that my
          life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
      <p>The curtain has been lifted. I have seen the rich reward laid up for the saints. I have had a taste of the joys
          of the world to come, and it has spoiled this world for me. My affections, my interests, hopes, my all is in
          heaven. I long to see the King in His beauty, Him whom my soul loveth. Heaven, sweet heaven. “I long to be
          there; and the thought that ‘tis near, makes me almost impatient for Christ to appear.” Praise the Lord for a
          good hope through Jesus Christ of immortality and eternal <nobr>life.—Letter</nobr> 9, 1851.</p>
