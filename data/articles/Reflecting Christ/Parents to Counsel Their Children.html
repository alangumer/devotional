    <h1>Parents to Counsel Their Children</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>If sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Proverbs 1:10.</strong></p>
      <p>Parents should encourage their children to conﬁde in them and unburden to them their heart griefs, their daily
          little annoyances and trials. If they do this, the parents can learn to sympathize with their children, and
          pray for them and with them, that God would shield and guide them. They should point them to their
          <nobr>never-failing</nobr> Friend and Counselor, who will be touched with the feelings of their inﬁrmities. He
          was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.</p>
      <p>Satan tempts children to be reserved to their parents, and choose their young and inexperienced companions as
          their conﬁdants; such as cannot help them, or give them good advice....</p>
      <p>Children would be saved from many evils if they would be more familiar with their parents. Parents should
          encourage in their children a disposition to be open and frank with them, to come to them with their
          difﬁculties, and when they are perplexed as to what course is right, to lay the matter just as they view it
          before their parents, and ask advice of them.</p>
      <p>Who are so well calculated to see and point out their dangers as godly parents? Who can understand the peculiar
          temperaments of their children as well as they? The mother who has watched every turn of the mind from
          infancy, and is acquainted with the natural disposition, is best prepared to counsel her children. Who can
          tell as well what traits of character to check and restrain as the mother, aided by the father?</p>
      <p>Children who are Christians will prefer the love and approbation of their <nobr>God-fearing</nobr> parents
          above every earthly blessing. They will love and honor their parents. This should be one of the principal
          studies of their lives. How can I make my parents happy? Children who have not been disciplined and received
          right instruction have but little sense of their obligations to their parents....</p>
      <p>Active hands and minds do not ﬁnd time to heed every temptation the enemy suggests; but idle hands and brains
          are all ready for Satan to control, and parents should teach their children that idleness is
          <nobr>sin.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, June 6, 1878.</p>
      <p>The Lord requires perfection from His redeemed family. He calls for perfection in
          <nobr>character-building.</nobr> Fathers and mothers especially need to understand the best methods of
          training children, that they may cooperate with God. Men and women, children and youth, are measured in the
          scales of heaven in accordance with that which they reveal in their home life. A Christian in the home is a
          Christian everywhere. Religion brought into the home exerts an inﬂuence that cannot be
          <nobr>measured.—The</nobr> S.D.A. Bible Commentary 5:1085.</p>
