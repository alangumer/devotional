    <h1>The Value of Pain</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory
          which shall be revealed in us. Romans 8:18.</strong></p>
      <p>In the experience of the apostle John under persecution, there is a lesson of wonderful strength and comfort
          for the Christian. God does not prevent the plottings of wicked men, but He causes their devices to work for
          good to those who in trial and conﬂict maintain their faith and loyalty. Often the gospel laborer carries on
          his work amid storms of persecution, bitter opposition, and unjust reproach. At such times let him remember
          that the experience to be gained in the furnace of trial and afﬂiction is worth all the pain it costs. Thus
          God brings His children near to Him, that He may show them their weakness and His strength. He teaches them to
          lean on Him. Thus He prepares them to meet emergencies, to ﬁll positions of trust, and to accomplish the great
          purpose for which their powers were given them.</p>
      <p>In all ages God’s appointed witnesses have exposed themselves to reproach and persecution for the truth’s sake.
          Joseph was maligned and persecuted because he preserved his virtue and integrity. David, the chosen messenger
          of God, was hunted like a beast of prey by his enemies. Daniel was cast into a den of lions because he was
          true to his allegiance to heaven. Job was deprived of his worldly possessions, and so afﬂicted in body that he
          was abhorred by his relatives and friends; yet he maintained his integrity.</p>
      <p>Jeremiah could not be deterred from speaking the words that God had given him to speak; and his testimony so
          enraged the king and princes that he was cast into a loathsome pit. Stephen was stoned because he preached
          Christ and Him cruciﬁed. Paul was imprisoned, beaten with rods, stoned, and ﬁnally put to death because he was
          a faithful messenger for God to the Gentiles. And John was banished to the Isle of Patmos “for the word of
          God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p>These examples of human steadfastness bear witness to the faithfulness of God’s <nobr>promises—of</nobr> His
          abiding presence and sustaining grace. They testify to the power of faith to withstand the powers of the
          world....</p>
      <p>They bore witness to the power of One mightier than Satan.... Through trial and</p>
      <p>persecution the <nobr>glory—the</nobr><nobr>character—of</nobr> God is revealed in His chosen ones. The
          believers in Christ, hated and persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of Christ.
          On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are puriﬁed in the furnace of <nobr>afﬂiction.—The</nobr> Acts of the
          Apostles, <nobr>574-576.</nobr></p>
