    <h1>Christians to Reﬂect the Light of Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel,
          but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Matthew 5:14, 15.</strong></p>
      <p>“Ye are the light of the world,” said Christ to His disciples. As the sun goes forth in the heavens, dispelling
          the shades of night, and ﬁlling the world with brightness, so must the followers of Jesus let their light
          shine to dispel the moral darkness of a world lying in sin. But they have no light of themselves; it is the
          light of Heaven which they are to reﬂect to the world.</p>
      <p>“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.” Our thoughts and purposes are the secret springs of action, and
          hence determine the character. The purpose formed in the heart need not be expressed in word or deed in order
          to make it sin, and bring the soul into condemnation. Every thought, feeling, and inclination, though unseen
          by men, is discerned by the eye of God. But it is only when the evil that has taken root in the heart reaches
          its fruition in the unlawful word or deed that man can judge the character of his fellowman.</p>
      <p>The Christian is Christ’s representative. He is to show to the world the transforming power of divine grace. He
          is a living epistle of the truth of God, known and read of all men. The rule given by Christ by which to
          determine who are His true followers is, “By their fruits ye shall know them.” ...</p>
      <p>The Christian’s godly life and holy conversation are a daily testimony against sin and sinners. But he must
          present Christ, not self. Christ is the great remedy for sin. Our compassionate Redeemer has provided for us
          the help we need. He is waiting to impute His righteousness to the sincere penitent, and to kindle in his
          heart such divine love as only our gracious Redeemer can inspire. Then let us who profess to be His witnesses
          on earth, His ambassadors from the court of heaven, glorify Him whom we represent, by being faithful to our
          trust as light bearers to the world.</p>
      <p>Everyone who at last secures eternal life will here manifest zeal and devotion in the service of God. He will
          not desert the post of duty at the approach of trial, hardship, or reproach. He will be a diligent student of
          the Scriptures, and will follow the light as it shines upon his pathway. When some plain, scriptural
          requirement is presented he will not stop to inquire, What will my friends say, if I take my position with the
          people of God? Knowing his duty, he will do it heartily and fearlessly.</p>
      <p>Of such truehearted followers Jesus declares that He is not ashamed to call them brethren. The God of truth
          will be on their side, and will never forsake them. All apparent losses for Christ’s sake will count to them
          as inﬁnite <nobr>gain.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, March 25, 1886.</p>
