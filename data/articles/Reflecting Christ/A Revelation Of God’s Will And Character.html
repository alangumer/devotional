    <h1>A Revelation Of God’s Will And Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Romans 7:12. Many religious teachers
          assert that Christ by His death abolished the law, and men are</strong></p>
      <p>henceforth free from its requirements. There are some who represent it as a grievous yoke, and in contrast to
          the bondage of the law they present the liberty to be enjoyed under the gospel.</p>
      <p>But not so did prophets and apostles regard the holy law of God. Said David: “I will walk at liberty: for I
          seek thy precepts” (Psalm 119:45). The apostle James, who wrote after the death of Christ, refers to the
          Decalogue as “the royal law” and “the perfect law of liberty” (James 2:8; 1:25). And the revelator, half a
          century after the cruciﬁxion, pronounces a blessing upon them “that do His commandments, that they may have
          right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city” (Revelation 22:14).</p>
      <p>The claim that Christ by His death abolished His Father’s law is without foundation. Had it been possible for
          the law to be changed or set aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the penalty of sin. The
          death of Christ, so far from abolishing the law, proves that it is immutable. The Son of God came to “magnify
          the law, and make it honourable” (Isaiah 42:21).... And concerning Himself He declares: “I delight to do thy
          will, O my God:</p>
      <p>yea, thy law is within my heart” (Psalm 40:8).</p>
      <p>The law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a revelation of the will and the character of its
          Author. God is love, and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and love to man. “Love is
          the fulﬁlling of the law” (Romans 13:10). The character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the nature
          of His law. Says the psalmist: “Thy law is the truth”; “all thy commandments are righteousness” (Psalm
          119:142, 172). And the apostle Paul declares: “The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good”
          (Romans 7:12). Such a law, being an expression of the mind and will of God, must be as enduring as its
          Author.</p>
      <p>It is the work of conversion and sanctiﬁcation to reconcile men to God by bringing them into accord with the
          principles of His law. In the beginning, man was created in the image of God. He was in perfect harmony with
          the nature and the law of God; the principles of righteousness were written upon his heart. But sin alienated
          him from his Maker. He no longer reﬂected the divine image.... But “God so loved the world, that He gave
          His</p>
      <p><nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son,” that man might be reconciled to God. Through the merits of Christ he can be
          restored to harmony with his <nobr>Maker.—The</nobr> Great Controversy, 466, 467.</p>
