    <h1>Jesus Desires that We Become One with Him</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus desires to efface the image of the earthly from the minds of His followers, and to impress upon them the
          image of the heavenly, that they may become one with Himself, reﬂecting His character, and showing forth the
          praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. If you have been permitted to
          stand in the presence of the Sun of Righteousness, it is not that you may absorb and conceal the bright beams
          of Christ’s righteousness, but that you may become a light to others.... There are persons who</p>
      <p>have received the precious light of the righteousness of Christ, but they do not act upon it....</p>
      <p>They prefer the sophistry of the enemy rather than the plain, “Thus saith the Lord.” ...</p>
      <p>The character we cultivate, the attitude we assume today, is ﬁxing our future destiny. We are all making a
          choice, either to be with the blessed, inside the City of Light, or to be with the wicked, outside the city.
          The principles which govern our actions on earth are known in heaven, and our deeds are faithfully chronicled
          in the books of record. It is there known whether our characters are after the order of Christ.... Are we wise
          virgins? ... This is the</p>
      <p>question which we are deciding today by our character and attitude....</p>
      <p>To be pardoned in the way that Christ pardons is not only to be forgiven, but to be renewed in the spirit of
          our mind. The Lord says, “A new heart will I give unto thee.” The image of Christ is to be stamped upon the
          very mind, and heart, and soul. The apostle says, “And we have the mind of Christ.” Without the transforming
          process which can come alone through divine power, the original propensities to sin are left in the heart in
          all their strength, to forge new chains, to impose a slavery that can never be broken by human power....</p>
      <p>When Christ comes, the balances of heaven will weigh the character, and decide whether it is pure, sanctiﬁed,
          and holy....</p>
      <p>Happiness is the result of holiness, and conformity to the will of God. Those who would be saints in heaven,
          must ﬁrst be saints upon the earth; for when we leave this earth, we shall take our character with us, and
          this will be simply taking with us some of the elements of heaven imparted to us through the righteousness of
          Christ....</p>
      <p>The experience that follows complete surrender to God, is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
          <nobr>Ghost.—The</nobr> Review and Herald, August 19, 1890.</p>
