    <h1>Christ Revealed The Riches Of Heaven</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto
          the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted. Isaiah 61:1.</strong></p>
      <p>Never was there such an evangelist as Christ. He was the Majesty of heaven, but He humbled Himself to take our
          nature, that He might meet men where they were. To all people, rich and poor, free and bond, Christ, the
          Messenger of the covenant, brought the tidings of salvation. His fame as the Great Healer spread throughout
          Palestine. The sick came to the places through which He would pass, that they might call on Him for help.
          Hither, too, came many anxious to hear His words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from city to
          city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing the <nobr>sick—the</nobr> King of glory in the lowly
          garb of humanity.</p>
      <p>He attended the great yearly festivals of the nation, and to the multitude absorbed in outward ceremony He
          spoke of heavenly things, bringing eternity within their view. To all He brought treasures from the storehouse
          of wisdom. He spoke to them in language so simple that they could not fail of understanding. By methods
          peculiarly His own, He helped all who were in sorrow and afﬂiction. With tender, courteous grace, He
          ministered to the <nobr>sin-sick</nobr> soul, bringing healing and strength....</p>
      <p>What a busy life He led! Day by day He might have been seen entering the humble abodes of want and sorrow,
          speaking hope to the downcast and peace to the distressed. Gracious, tenderhearted, pitiful, He went about
          lifting up the <nobr>bowed-down</nobr> and comforting the sorrowful. Wherever He went, He carried
          blessing.</p>
      <p>While He ministered to the poor, Jesus studied also to ﬁnd ways of reaching the rich. He sought the
          acquaintance of the wealthy and cultured Pharisee, the Jewish nobleman, and the Roman ruler. He accepted their
          invitations, attended their feasts, made Himself familiar with their interests and occupations, that He might
          gain access to their hearts, and reveal to them the imperishable riches.</p>
      <p>Christ came to this world to show that by receiving power from on high, man can live an unsullied life. With
          unwearying patience and sympathetic helpfulness, He met men in their necessities. By the gentle touch of
          grace, He banished from the soul unrest and doubt, changing enmity to love, and unbelief to conﬁdence....</p>
      <p>At the sound of His voice the spirit of greed and ambition ﬂed from the heart, and men arose, emancipated, to
          follow the <nobr>Saviour.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, <nobr>22-25.</nobr></p>
