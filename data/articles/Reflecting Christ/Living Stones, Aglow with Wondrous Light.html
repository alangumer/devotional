    <h1>Living Stones, Aglow with Wondrous Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye
          also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house ... acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 2:4,
          5.</strong></p>
      <p>When the sacred work of God shall be puriﬁed from all the rubbish which has been accumulating for years, the
          name of God will be gloriﬁed in your midst. When the Holy Spirit controls human agents, there will be none of
          the underhand business which has been practiced. Honesty, truthfulness, and a willingness that all should
          understand the methods of working will be seen. The characters of the workers will be built up with pure,
          solid timbers. Straightforwardness in deal will be seen in all God’s <nobr>commandment-keeping</nobr> people.
          Every thread of the web will be originated by the Lord, and each worker will draw his thread into the web to
          help compose the pattern. The pattern will come from the great loom perfect in its design.</p>
      <p>Three thousand years ago, David asked the question, “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking
          heed thereto according to thy word.” Souls already impure need to be cleansed, puriﬁed, and sanctiﬁed. Then
          the testimony can be borne, “God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,
          to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p>In this world we are to shine in good works. The Lord requires His people who handle sacred things to be alone
          with God, to reﬂect the principles of heaven in every business transaction, to reﬂect the light of God’s
          character, God’s love, as Christ reﬂected it. [As we look] unto Jesus, all our lives will be aglow with that
          wondrous light. Every part of us is to be light; then whichever way we turn, light will be reﬂected from us to
          others....</p>
      <p>The fruit of the <nobr>Spirit—what</nobr> is it? Gloom, and sadness, and mourning, and tears? No, no; the fruit
          of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, <nobr>long-suffering,</nobr> gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance. These graces will be seen in every stone that helps to compose the temple of God. All the stones
          are not of the same dimension or shape, but every stone has its place in the temple.</p>
      <p>In the temple there is not one misshapen stone. Each is perfect, and in the diversity there is unity, making a
          complete whole. One thing is sure, every stone is a living stone, a stone that emits light. Now is the time
          for the stones taken from the quarry of the world to be brought into the workshop of God, and hewed, squared,
          and polished, that they may <nobr>shine.—Special</nobr> Instruction Regarding Royalties, 20, 21.</p>
