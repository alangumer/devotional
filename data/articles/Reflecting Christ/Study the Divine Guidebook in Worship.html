    <h1>Study the Divine Guidebook in Worship</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
          word of truth. 2 Timothy 2:15.</strong></p>
      <p>The Bible is a guide in the management of children. Here, if parents desire, they may ﬁnd a course marked out
          for the education and training of their children, that they may make no blunders.... When this Guidebook is
          followed, parents, instead of giving unlimited</p>
      <p>indulgence to their children, will use more often the chastening rod; instead of being blind to their faults,
          their perverse tempers, and alive only to their virtues, they will have clear discernment and will look upon
          these things in the light of the Bible. They will know that they must command their children in the right
          <nobr>way.—Child</nobr> Guidance, 256.</p>
      <p>The Word of God abounds in general principles for the formation of correct habits of living, and the
          testimonies, general and personal, have been calculated to call their attention more especially to these
          <nobr>principles.—Testimonies</nobr> for the Church 4:323.</p>
      <p>In arousing and strengthening a love for Bible study, much depends on the use of the hour of worship. The hours
          of morning and evening worship should be the sweetest and most helpful of the day. Let it be understood that
          into these hours no troubled, unkind thoughts are to intrude; that parents and children assemble to meet with
          Jesus, and to invite into the home the presence of holy angels. Let the services be brief and full of life,
          adapted to the occasion, and varied from time to time.</p>
      <p>Let all join in the Bible reading and learn and often repeat God’s law. It will add to the interest of the
          children if they are sometimes permitted to select the reading. Question them upon it, and let them ask
          questions. Mention anything that will serve to illustrate its meaning. When the service is not thus made too
          lengthy, let the little ones take part in prayer, and let them join in song, if it be but a single
          verse....</p>
      <p>Parents should take time daily for Bible study with their children. No doubt it will require effort and
          planning and some sacriﬁce to accomplish this; but the effort will be richly repaid. As a preparation for
          teaching His precepts, God commands that they be hidden in the hearts of the parents. “These words, which I
          command thee this day, shall be in thine heart,” He says: “and thou shalt teach them diligently” (Deuteronomy
          6:6, 7). In order to interest our children in the Bible, we ourselves must be interested in it. To awaken in
          them a love for its study, we must love it.... All that God’s Word commands, we are to</p>
      <p>obey. All that it promises, we may <nobr>claim.—Education,</nobr><nobr>186-189.</nobr></p>
