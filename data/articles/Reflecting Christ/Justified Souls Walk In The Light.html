    <h1>Justiﬁed Souls Walk In The Light</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>God presented him [Christ Jesus] as a sacriﬁce of atonement, through faith in his blood.... He did it
          to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and</strong></p>
      <p>the one who justiﬁes the man who has faith in Jesus. Romans 3:25, 26, N.I.V.</p>
      <p>“Being justiﬁed freely by his grace,” the apostle Paul says, “through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
          whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
          remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his
          righteousness: that he might be just, and the justiﬁer of him which believeth in Jesus.”</p>
      <p>Here the truth is laid out in plain lines. This mercy and goodness is wholly undeserved. The grace of Christ is
          freely to justify the sinner without merit or claim on his part. Justiﬁcation is a full, complete pardon of
          sin. The moment a sinner accepts Christ by faith, that moment he is pardoned. The righteousness of Christ is
          imputed to him, and he is no more to doubt God’s forgiving grace.</p>
      <p>There is nothing in faith that makes it our saviour. Faith cannot remove our guilt. Christ is the power of God
          unto salvation to all them that believe. The justiﬁcation comes through the merits of Jesus Christ. He has
          paid the price for the sinner’s redemption. Yet it is only through faith in His blood that Jesus can justify
          the believer.</p>
      <p>The sinner cannot depend upon his own good works as a means of justiﬁcation. He must come to the point where he
          will renounce all his sin, and embrace one degree of light after another, as it shines upon his pathway. He
          simply grasps by faith the free and ample provision made in the blood of Christ. He believes the promises of
          God which through Christ are made unto him sanctiﬁcation and righteousness and redemption.</p>
      <p>And if he follows Jesus, he will walk humbly in the light, rejoicing in the light, and diffusing that light to
          others. Being justiﬁed by faith, he carries cheerfulness with him in his obedience in all his life. Peace with
          God is the result of what Christ is to him. The souls who are in subordination to God, who honor Him, and are
          doers of His Word, will receive divine enlightenment. In the precious Word of God, there is purity and
          loftiness as well as beauty that, unless assisted by God, the highest powers of man cannot attain to....</p>
      <p>We are none of us excusable, under any form of trial, for letting our hold upon God become loosened. Although
          the compassion of man may fail, still God loves and pities, and reaches out His helping hand. God’s
          everlasting arms encircle the soul that turns to Him for aid.... God loves to have His children ask Him, and
          trust Him to do for them those things</p>
      <p>which they cannot do for <nobr>themselves.—The</nobr> Signs of the Times, May 19, 1898.</p>
