    <h1>God’s Law Is The Standard Of Character</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. Psalm
          119:142.</strong></p>
      <p>Erroneous theories of sanctiﬁcation ... have a prominent place in the religious movements of the day. These
          theories are both false in doctrine and dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so
          generally ﬁnding favor renders it doubly essential that all have a clear understanding of what the Scriptures
          teach upon this point.</p>
      <p>True sanctiﬁcation is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Thessalonian church, declares:
          “This is the will of God, even your sanctiﬁcation.” And he prays: “The very God of peace sanctify you wholly”
          (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23). The Bible clearly teaches what sanctiﬁcation is and how it is to be attained. The
          Saviour prayed for His disciples: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth” (John 17:17). And Paul
          teaches that believers are to be “sanctiﬁed by the Holy Ghost” (Romans 15:16).</p>
      <p>What is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: “When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
          guide you into all truth” (John 16:13). And the psalmist says: “Thy law is the truth.” ... And since the law
          of God is “holy, and just, and good,” a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a character
          formed by obedience to that law will be holy.</p>
      <p>Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He says: “I have kept my Father’s commandments.” “I do always
          those things that please him” (John 15:10; 8:29). The followers of Christ are to become like
          <nobr>Him—by</nobr> the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy law. This
          is Bible sanctiﬁcation.</p>
      <p>This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul
          admonishes believers: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you
          both to will and to do of his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:12, 13). The Christian will feel the promptings of
          sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is where Christ’s help is needed. Human weakness
          becomes united to divine strength, and faith exclaims: “Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through
          our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 15:57).</p>
      <p>The Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctiﬁcation is progressive. When in conversion the sinner ﬁnds
          peace with God through the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just begun. Now he is to “go on
          unto perfection”; to grow up “unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of <nobr>Christ.”—The</nobr>
          Great Controversy, 469, 470.</p>
