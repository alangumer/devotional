    <h1>Christ Inspires Souls with Conﬁdence in God</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even
          our faith. 1 John 5:4.</strong></p>
      <p>What kind of faith is it that overcomes the world? It is that faith which makes Christ your own personal
          <nobr>Saviour—that</nobr> faith which, recognizing your helplessness, your utter inability to save yourself,
          takes hold of the Helper who is mighty to save, as your only hope. It is faith that will not be discouraged,
          that hears the voice of Christ saying, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world, and My divine strength is
          yours.” It is the faith that hears Him say, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”</p>
      <p>The reason why the churches are weak and sickly and ready to die is that the enemy has brought inﬂuences of a
          discouraging nature to bear upon trembling souls. He has sought to shut Jesus from their view as the
          Comforter, as one who reproves, who warns, who admonishes them, saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it.”
          Christ has all power in heaven and in earth, and He can strengthen the wavering, and set right the erring. He
          can inspire with conﬁdence, with hope in God; and conﬁdence in God always results in creating conﬁdence in one
          another.</p>
      <p>Every soul must have a realization that Christ is his personal Saviour; then love and zeal and steadfastness
          will be manifest in the Christian life. However clear and convincing the truth is, it will fail to sanctify
          the soul, fail to strengthen and fortify it in its conﬂicts, unless it is brought in constant contact with
          life. Satan has achieved his greatest success through interposing himself between the soul and the
          Saviour.</p>
      <p>Christ should never be out of the mind. The angels said concerning Him, “Thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he
          shall save his people from their sins.” Jesus, precious Saviour! Assurance, helpfulness, security, and peace
          are all in Him. He is the dispeller of all our doubts, the earnest of all our hopes. How precious is the
          thought that we may indeed become partakers of the divine nature, whereby we may overcome as Christ overcame!
          Jesus is the fullness of our expectation. He is the melody of our songs, the shadow of a great rock in a weary
          land. He is living water to the thirsty soul. He is our refuge in the storm. He is our righteousness, our
          sanctiﬁcation, our redemption. When Christ is our personal Saviour, we shall show forth the praises of Him who
          hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light....</p>
      <p>Christ died because the law was transgressed, that guilty man might be saved from the penalty of his enormous
          guilt. But history has proved that it is easier to destroy the world than to reform it; for men cruciﬁed the
          Lord of Glory, who came to unite earth with heaven, and man with <nobr>God.—The</nobr> Review and Herald,
          August 26, 1890.</p>
