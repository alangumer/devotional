    <h1>The Revelation Of God’s Love In The Cross</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God. Romans
          8:34.</strong></p>
      <p>The revelation of God’s love to man centers in the cross. Its full signiﬁcance tongue cannot utter, pen cannot
          portray, the mind of man cannot comprehend. Looking upon the cross of Calvary, we can only say, “God so loved
          the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
          everlasting life” (John 3:16).</p>
      <p>Christ cruciﬁed for our sins, Christ risen from the dead, Christ ascended on high, is the science of salvation
          that we are to learn and to teach....</p>
      <p>“It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God” (Romans 8:34).
          “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to
          make intercession for them” (Hebrews 7:25)....</p>
      <p>It is through the gift of Christ that we receive every blessing. Through that gift there comes to us day by day
          the unfailing ﬂow of Jehovah’s goodness. Every ﬂower, with its delicate tints and its fragrance, is given for
          our enjoyment through that one Gift. The sun and the moon were made by Him. There is not a star which
          beautiﬁes the heavens that He did not make. Every drop of rain that falls, every ray of light shed upon our
          unthankful world, testiﬁes to the love of God in Christ. Everything is supplied to us through the one
          unspeakable Gift, God’s <nobr>only-begotten</nobr> Son. He was nailed to the cross that all these bounties
          might ﬂow to God’s workmanship.</p>
      <p>“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God” (1
          John 3:1)....</p>
      <p>The knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowledge that all who are saved must have. It is the
          knowledge that works transformation of character. This knowledge, received, will <nobr>re-create</nobr> the
          soul in the image of God. It will impart to the whole being a spiritual power that is divine....</p>
      <p>Of His own life the Saviour said, “I have kept my Father’s commandments” (John 15:10). “The Father hath not
          left me alone; for I do always those things that please him” (chap. 8:29). As Jesus was in human nature, so
          God means His followers to be. In His strength we are to live the life of purity and nobility which the
          Saviour <nobr>lived.—The</nobr> Ministry of Healing, <nobr>423-426.</nobr></p>
      <p>In the rock Christ Jesus is our only <nobr>safety.—The</nobr> Upward Look, 293.</p>
